### Important Upgrade Note for Swift
- [#3130](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/3130) fixes a swift interop error that does have a breaking API change if you are using Swift. This was [identified](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/issues/3137) after 2.6.2 was released. It changes the method from `throws` to an error pointer, since that method does return an object and also handles an error pointer, which does not play nicely with the Swift/Objective-C error conversion. See [#2810](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/issues/2810) for additional notes. This affects `AFURLRequestionSerializer` and `AFURLResponseSerializer`.

#### Added
- `AFHTTPSessionManager` now copies its `securityPolicy`
  - Fixed by [mohamede1945](https://github.com/mohamede1945) in [#2887](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/2887).

#### Updated
- Updated travis to run on 7.1
  - Fixed by [kcharwood](https://github.com/kcharwood) in [#3132](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/3132).
- Simplifications of if and return statements in `AFSecurityPolicy`
  - Fixed by [TorreyBetts](https://github.com/TorreyBetts) in [#3063](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/3063).

#### Fixed
- Fixed swift interop issue that prevented returning a nil NSURL for a download task
  - Fixed by [kcharwood](https://github.com/kcharwood) in [#3133](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/3133).
- Suppressed false positive memory leak warning in Reachability Manager
  - Fixed by [kcharwood](https://github.com/kcharwood) in [#3131](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/3131).
- Fixed swift interop issue with throws and Request/Response serialization
  - Fixed by [kcharwood](https://github.com/kcharwood) in [#3130](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/3130).

**Important Upgrade Notes**
Please note the following API/project changes have been made:
- iOS 6 support has now been removed from the podspec. Note that iOS 6 support has not been removed explicitly from the project, but it will be removed in a future update.
- **Full Certificate Chain Validation has been removed** from `AFSecurityPolicy`. As discussed in [#2744](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/issues/2744), there was no documented security advantage to pinning against an entire certificate chain. If you were using full certificate chain, please determine and select the most ideal certificate in your chain to pin against.
  - Implemented by [Kevin Harwood](https://github.com/kcharwood) in [#2856](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/2856).
- **The request url will now be returned by the `UIImageView` category if the image is returned from cache.** In previous releases, both the request and the response were nil. Going forward, only the response will be nil.
  - Implemented by [Chris Gibbs](https://github.com/chrisgibbs) in [#2771](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/2771).
- **Support for App Extension Targets is now baked in using `NS_EXTENSION_UNAVAILABLE_IOS`.** You no longer need to define `AF_APP_EXTENSIONS` in order to include code in a extension target.
  - Implemented by [bnickel](https://github.com/bnickel) in [#2737](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/2737).
- This release now supports watchOS 2.0, which relys on target conditionals that are only present in Xcode 7 and iOS 9/watchOS 2.0/OS X 10.10. If you install the library using CocoaPods, AFNetworking will define these target conditionals for on older platforms, allowing your code to complile. If you do not use Cocoapods, you will need to add the following code your to PCH file.

```
#ifndef TARGET_OS_IOS
  #define TARGET_OS_IOS TARGET_OS_IPHONE
#endif
#ifndef TARGET_OS_WATCH
  #define TARGET_OS_WATCH 0
#endif
```
- This release migrates query parameter serialization to model AlamoFire and adhere to RFC standards. Note that `/` and `?` are no longer encoded by default.
  - Implemented by [Kevin Harwood](https://github.com/kcharwood) in [#2908](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/pull/2908).

**Note** that support for `NSURLConnection` based API's will be removed in a future update. If you have not already done so, it is recommended that you transition to the `NSURLSession` APIs in the very near future.
