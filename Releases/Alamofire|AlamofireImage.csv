### Upgrade Notes

This release contains a non-backwards compatible change that fixes a typo in the `UIButton` extension where `placeholderImage` was misspelled in two APIs. Rather than push a MAJOR version release for a typo that people are generally getting incorrect, we decided to break semver here and fix the typo for everyone. Please note that we always try to follow semver as strictly as possible. However, this seemed like the best option given that users would continue to struggle with the typo throughout the lifespan of the 3.x releases.
