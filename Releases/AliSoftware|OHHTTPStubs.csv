- The `OHHTTPStubs` spec has been splitted into **multiple subspecs**:
  - The default subspec (used when you simply use `pod 'OHHTTPStubs'` in your `Podfile`) contains the subspecs `Core`, `NSURLSession`, `JSON` & `OHPathHelpers` (so that it matches the features that most people use).
  - Other optional subspecs are `HTTPMessage` and `Mocktail` (which are opt-in because used by much less people). If you want to use them, you'll need to request them explicitly in your `Podfile` using `pod 'OHHTTPStubs/Mocktail` for example.
- The iOS Unit Tests are now also run for the framework as well as for the static library, to ensure the tests pass in both contexts _(because frameworks sometimes introduce subtleties like when using `NSBundle`, so it's worth testing in that context too)_

In details:
- `NSURLSessionConfiguration` 's swizzling (to add automatic support of `OHHTTPStubs` to `NSURLSession`) is now done in the `+load` method of an `NSURLSessionConfiguration` category, to be sure it is loaded (and swizzled) only once, even if `OHHTTPStubs` is loaded by two different bundles.
- The stubs activation of `NSURLSessionConfiguration` no longer uses `objc_getClass` but uses a call to the `OHHTTPStubs` class instead, which ensure that it uses the correct `OHHTTPStubs` class in the current bundle instead of always using the one loaded from the main bundle.
