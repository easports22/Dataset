Siren 3.0.0 is the Swift 4 language-compatible version of Siren. It builds on the architectural changes that were introduced earlier this year, and adds some Swift 4 features, mainly `Decodable` and `JSDecoder`. 

Moving forward, any bugfixes or features will only make their way to the Swift 4 version of the codebase.

The reason for releasing 2.0.0 so soon after releasing 1.0.0 (~6 months) is due to a breaking public API change. Specifically, `showAlertAfterCurrentVersionHasBeenReleasedForDays` changed from `Int?` to `Int` and now has a default value of `1` to avoid a timing issue between the App Store JSON being updated faster than the App Store receiving your updated app binary. This means that, by default, the App Update will appear 24 hours after the value that appears in the JSON to make sure the App Stores has the latest binary. Many users who used the `.force` reported experiencing infinite loops. This should be addressed now.

Other updates include:

  - The `SirenDelegate` protocol has moved to SirenDelegate.swift
  - SirenTestHelper.swift now contains the XCTest Helper functions
  - `public` and `private` enums have had their names and scopes changed. For example:
    - `SirenLanguageType` -> `Siren.LanguageType`
    - `SirenAlertType` -> `Siren.AlertType`

#54, #55, #56 

## TL;DR
- Siren uses your app's bundle identifier to perform a version check. The appID param is now used by Siren under the hood. It'll throw an error if you try to set it as it's privately scoped.
- `SirenDelegate` now sets default empty implementations of all six methods. Therefore, the `@objc` attribute and `optional` keyword have been removed as all `SirenDelegate` methods are now optional by default.
- Signature change from `sirenDidShowUpdateDialog()` to `sirenDidShowUpdateDialog(alertType: SirenAlertType)`

## Long Version
- As of v0.8.0, Siren is now able to check if your users are using the current version of your app using the app's bundle identifier, which is accessible through the NSBundle API. Instead of removing/deprecating appID, it is still storing your app's iTunes Connect appID, but it is now determined the appID dynamically from the results of the iTunes Lookup API call. Once it's determined, the appID is stored within Siren and used to launch the App Store page of your app when needed.
- Removed `@objc` attribute from `SirenDelegate`.
- Removed `optional` keyword from all `SirenDelegate` methods.
- `SirenDelegate` now sets default empty implementations of all six methods.
- Signature change from `sirenDidShowUpdateDialog()` to `sirenDidShowUpdateDialog(alertType: SirenAlertType)`
