Version 4 is the culmination of many great new additions to AudioKit from a number of core team members, old and new.  There were 929 files changed over 648 commits since V3.7.1.

* Awesome new (optional) syntax for connection nodes e.g. ""mic >>> delay >>> reverb >>> mixer""
* New taps by Dave O'Neill: AKLazyTap, AKRenderTap, AKTimelineTap
* New sample accurate nodes from Audive, Inc.: AKClipPlayer, AKClipRecorder, AKClipMerger
* New sample player: AKSamplePlayer
* Sample accurate timing demonstrated in iOS example ""MetronomeSamplerSync""
* Mike Gazzarusso's guitar processing nodes: AKDynaRageProcessor Tube Compressor and AKRhinoGuitarProcessor Amp Model
* Audio Unit hosting with Ryan Francesconi's AKAudioUnitManager class and examples for iOS and macOS
* All synthesizer bank nodes contain vibrato and pitch bend controls (instead of frequencyMultiplier and detuningOffset)
* Better handling of routes and backgrounding
* Offline rendering on latest operating systems (demonstrated in tests, more examples soon)
* Update MIDI Monitor example to send MIDI Sysex (example is now called ""MIDIUtility"")
* New iOS Drums example and two new drum playgrounds
* New macOS examples: RandomClips, Recorder
* AudioKitUI is now a separate framework and maybe omitted when you don't need audio plots
* New themes for playgrounds and playground widgets by Yaron Karasik
* New AKTableView UI element to display static waveforms or any single value plot, with an example playground demonstrating its use
* Many new tests (were up to 323 tests)
* Improved README and other Github niceties

And much more actually, its just a bit hard to remember everything.

PLUS: There is actually a lot more on the way. Instead of waiting on it all to be ready, we're going to be adding quite a few majorly cool enhancements over the next few releases.
