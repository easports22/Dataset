```
Cartfile
Cartfile.resolved
Carthage/
    Build/
    Checkouts/
```

When you run `carthage build`, `carthage checkout`, or `carthage update` in a project with the old layout, it will be automatically migrated to the new structure. However, you will have to **manually update your project** to find its dependencies in the new location.

Instead of always using `/usr/bin/git`, Carthage will now use [whichever version of `git` is in your `$PATH`](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/pull/221). This means that `/usr/local/bin/git` can be prioritized over Apple's vulnerable build of Git now.

**You still must install a patched version of Git yourself, and ensure it lies first in your `$PATH`.**

Other minor fixes include:
- `~>` no longer treats [0.x and 0.y as compatible versions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/189)
- Better error messaging [when a repository has no tags](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/159)
