You can now change the colors of the Default Theme to whatever suits your needs from the options under `Appearance -> Material Custom Theme`, then select *Custom Theme* from the list of themes. Be creative and share your setup with others so they can use your beautiful crafted theme :)

Aside from this, three new themes made their apparition:
- Monokai Theme, a theme with the color of the famous Monokai Color Scheme
- Arc Dark Theme, the theme from the GTK Skin
- Atom One Dark Theme, the theme from the famous editor.

I'm working on a documentation and on a system to share theme setups, so you can preview and maybe even download themes (not sure about this part though).

I'm currently halting the development of the Material Theme since I did what I wanted to do, except in cases of bugs. Maybe I'll continue the development later but for now I have other plans :)

# Features:
- *Custom Accent Colors*: It is now possible to override the Bundled Accent Colors with your own
- *Uppercase Bold Tabs*: Change Editor Tabs to look like regular MD Tabs by having them bold and in uppercase! While this might look dumb by many of you, maybe some will have some good usages with it.
- Compact Sidebar customization: Now you can set the height you want in the sidebar, between 18 and 30.
- Extend minimal tab length to 18px

# Bug Fixes and Improvements:
- Fix some icons not having Retina support
- Fix File Colors not applying for PSI Icons (Classes, Interfaces and the sort)
- Fix breakpoint icon size
- Change deprecated color to a simple strikethrough
- Improve the ""disabled Material Theme"" UI and fix many NPEs from it
- Set Lighter Theme to extend IntelliJ Look And Feel instead of Darcula
- Add more UI Icons: debugger, VCS, Tool windows, Decorators and so on

7300436,2017-08-06T16:23:16Z,2017-08-07T05:46:03Z,File Status Colors,"This release is fixing some issues left out since the latest release, such as:
- Rewriting the Wallpaper component to unset the custom wallpaper at every exit, thus preventing the background to stick when the plugin is uninstalled
- Issues with selected line in the tree
- Fix height of debug tabs

But this release is also adding some new stuff, such as:
- New design for Material Checkboxes
- New design for Combobox Actions (in the toolbar)
- Changed the Javascript file icon
- More UI Icons (especially debugger icons, there is still a lot to do)
- Converted the old *Bold Tabs* to *Bold directories* to make opened directories bold in the tree (the old behavior of bold tabs is still there)

And last but not least, I've added a new feature: **File Status Colors**

## File Status Colors

**File Status Colors** were a feature added by Jetbrains that allow color schemes creators to set different colors to files in the Project Tree and Tabs according to the file status (added to VCS, Modified, In another changelist, Ignored...). However they removed that feature stating that File Colors are not supposed to be linked to Color Schemes but to Look and Feel. While I agree with them, there is still no much support for that change for plugin developers to provide their own file colors since there is no support for custom LAFs to begin with.

Therefore I've decided to implement back this feature to allow users to customize the file colors anyway with the colors of the theme.

The colors are found in the *Color Scheme Settings* under the section *Material File Colors*. All available statuses are there, added, modified, ignored, deleted... even some that I don't understand (Hijacked?) and you can customize it to your will. Remember though that these colors are bound to the **scheme**, not the **theme** (for the moment) so take this into mind.

Again, this release is still not available on the plugin rep, but as soon as the owner comes back from his vacation, hopefully we'll be at the version 1.0 :)

## Actions

The actions included are
- Toggle Contrast
- Compact Sidebar
- Compact Statusbar
- Hide File Icons
- Bigger tabs
- Material Design components
- Material Theme
- Material Icons
- Status bar indicator

These new actions will replace the existing ones in their relevant locations.

Besides, the Settings for the Material Theme Plugin are now located under the *Appearance* section instead of *Tools*

## Checkstyle and Copyright
Nothing much, but now files are copyrighted and a Checkstyle configuration is checking for common mistakes and performance issues. Nothing relevant for the users though.

## UI Icons
We're continuing on replacing the IDE's icons with Material Design ones. Included amongst others:
- Many tool window icons: Project, Autoscroll, More Settings, Hide Tool Windows, Collapse, Expand, Minimize
- Many action icons: Uninstall, Profile, CPU, Diff...
- Many debugger related icons: Disable breakpoint, View breakpoints, data types...
- Other general icons

There are still a lot to theme! In any case if someone has some issues with the icon or have a better idea/color, I'm all ears.

## Other

# Better dialog headers

It has been hard but I finally got able to change Dialogs look and feel to be more like a genuine Material Design IDE. Now, dialogs have a bigger heading, left aligned, with a better padding. Unfortunately (or not), it cannot be customized at the moment, but I'm sure you will love it so you won't be needing to disable it :)

# Material Design Loader

Replace the loader when loading large files, with the well known circular loader of Material Design. Of course, since this is not a Javascript IDE, the rendering is a little ugly, but I'm no SVG expert so for now bear with that.

# Compact (and Padded) status bar.

Make the status bar a little bigger with a little padding of 10px. And for those who prefer the regular one, I've added the option to do so obviously (like the Sublime plugin).

# Lighter theme improvement

Since my focus was to test the limits of the IDE since I've taken the project, I didn't focus a lot on improving current themes aside from the Default and Darker one. This time I've taken the time to inspect the Lighter theme and try to fix all the issues that I could find.
Of course, there is still a lot much to do but it should be significantly better than before.


The release is not yet published to the repository, because I haven't tested it in all IDEs yet. Hopefully there won't be some unexpected issues but if everything goes well, I'll release the new version till the end of the week.

Cheers.

6908532,2017-07-03T06:53:29Z,2017-07-03T07:07:54Z,Components and Tabs,"This release is mainly concentrated on patching IDE components to look more and more like a real Material Design IDE:
- *Material Table Headers*: This is a work in progress to have tables with a larger line-height to look like MD tables. For now only the headers are designed.
- *Material Inputs*: Remove the border and instead leave the bottom border like in Material Design. Doesn't apply to all inputs though, since Search Inputs are sometimes hardcoded therefore hard to patch.
- *Material Password* (and option to display/hide characters)
- *Material Tabs*: Bigger (and customizable) tab height!
- *Material Dialog Titles*: Fix the annoying gray gradient on dialog titles (TODO: set a bigger font for titles)
- *Better notification colors*: better red, green and yellow
- *New icons for module, excluded and test folders*: Now they have open folders decorators as well to see which files are opened in one of these directories.
- *Roboto font by default*: If you have Roboto font installed (which I recommend), it will replace the default font with it.

Aside from this, a panel of new options have been added to mimic the Sublime Text plugin more and more:
- *Themed Scrollbars*: Allow to set a better transparency to scrollbars instead of a pure gray. **Needs restart**
- *Custom Tree Indent*: Allow to reduce or extend the indentation in items in the Sidebar tree. Values are allowed from 2 to 8 (by step of 2).
- *Custom Tab Height*
- *Material Theme*: Now you can disable the Material Theme colors while leaving other components such as the buttons, icons or tabs.

Plus this version fixes some issues left open:
- #368 
- #365 
- #363 
- #358 
- #342 
- #340 
- #339
