* Better games compatibility for SNES Mini (updated database of preset IDs, better LoROM/HiROM detection).
* Built in database of problem games, so hakchi2 will ask you to switch to 3rd party emulator automatically (e.g. [RetroArch](https://github.com/ClusterM/retroarch-clover/releases)).
* Original games are not using extra memory space anymore, so we have some extra space for additional games (thanks to DanTheMan827!)
* ""remove_thumbnails"" mod no longer slows down SNES Mini's startup (thanks to brian91292!)
* Bundled with new mod ""snes_custom_filters"" which allows to disable scanlines in CRT mode or enable bilinear filter in 4:3 mode. Please read mod description before install.
* Bundled with new mod ""extra_space"".  This is experimental mod for SNES Mini which moves your save-states data to unused partition of NAND flash. This partition is only 50MB in size but it will free some space for games because SNES Mini's save-states are huge. Please read mod description before install.

But I don't want you to wait so long. I added new transfer method but left the old interface. Also I'm not sure that many people want new versions since hype train is gone :)

**Warning: If you updating from previous version hakchi2 will ask you to reinstall custom kernel. It's normal :)**

**Warning 2: If you used clovershell mod before, update it to the last version for correct work: https://github.com/ClusterM/clovershell-daemon/releases**
Or delete it from ""user_mods"" folder before custom kernel flashing. Elsewhere old buggy version will be installed instead new one.

## So, what's new
- Main modification - new transfer method. It's very fast. You can upload 300 MBytes of games in ~1.5-2 minutes. Also you don't need to hold reset and switch your NES Mini on/off. Just connect it to PC and turn on as usual.
- It's possible to change settings without re-uploading games.
- New driver installer should work on all Windows versions since XP. Please report me about any problems.
- Also better compatibility with Windows XP.
- You can drag'n'drop box art to main window now.
- Also it's possible to drag'n'drop module files.
- Automatic NES Mini/Famicom Mini detection.
- New hacked clovercon driver allows to use most (or all?) 3rd party classic controllers now.
- Autofire working for X/Y buttons too now (enable in menu and hold select+X or select+Y for a second).
- USB library changed to LibWinUsb, it's more portable.
- New game consoles, new images (thanks to NeoRame!)
- Many minor bugfixes and improvements.

# What's new
- Finally hakchi2 shows size of all selected games in main window. Why I have not done it before?
- One font to rule them all. New font contains HUGE amount of characters now. Including Latin supplement, Cyrillic, Hiragana, Katakana, etc. So NES Mini and Famicom Mini uses the same font now and you can create folders with very unusual characters (in Russian, for example).
- The main idea to separate hakchi2 from non-NES games failed, so it's optimized for 3rd path emulators now (i.e. RetroArch).
- Added presets for Sega 32x and Game Gear games, without images yet.
- ""/bin/path-to-your-app"" replaced by ""/bin/ext"" for unknown extensions.
- Compression support! Since RetroArch can run games directly from archives it's possible now to compress non-NES games using 7-Zip. This feature enabled by default but you can disable it in the settings menu. Also you can add the whole archive (required by MAME games).
- Fixed huge bug in folder manager when new folders were missed after first sync.
- Some minor bugfixes.

# Some important news

RetroArch mod has separate repository: https://github.com/ClusterM/retroarch-clover
I created only buggy sketch of this mod and granted full access to [pcm720](https://github.com/pcm720). And he did a really great job with tuning, optimization and core modules. Please update to the latest version:
https://github.com/ClusterM/retroarch-clover/releases
And send bugreports to https://github.com/ClusterM/retroarch-clover/issues

And some other very good news. I discovered a way to access NES Mini's shell and memory directly  without any soldering. It was the main problem: with current version of hakchi2 we can't read anything from NES Mini, we can only create script for writing and execute it. That's why hakchi2 has not any ability to check which games are installed, how many space left, backup save-states, upload only new games (without reuploading everything). It is surprising that we have not noticed this method before. So feature versions will be much better. But it requires a lot of work. 

## TODO List
- Translation tool
- Update FAQ
- Rewrite hakchi for using new methods

5502440,2017-02-19T14:48:18Z,2017-02-19T15:25:34Z,2.12 finally released!,"Sorry guys, I have not answered you messages for a while. I was really inspired by this project and totally lose my grip on reality. Finally there is new version.

There are many internal changes. Madmonkey and me updated hakchi scripts, so it's possible to install mods now. Everybody can create, share and download different mods like additional software, themes, e.g. it's possible to add and replace any files inside NES Classic Mini. You can even create mod to turn your NES Mini in Famicom Mini or translate Famicom Mini to English.

You need to put mods to ""user_mods"" folder and you can install and uninstall them via menu. Mods distributed as directory with files or "".hmod"" file which is just "".tar.gz"" archive. For this reason some features (like music disable feature) moved to user mods, you can use it as example. More detail documentation will be later, I hope. We need to relax a bit.

And our first downloadable mod is...

https://github.com/ClusterM/retroarch-clover/releases/

It's madmonkey's port of RetroArch emulator with my scripts for NES Mini integration. It will automatically detect unsupported NES games and launch them instead of default emulator. Exit to menu, save-states, etc. will work as usual. Also it can emulate SNES, Genesis, GBA and even Nintendo 64 (with Classic Controller, of course). It's weird to play N64 and Genesis games on NES, I know. That's why I made it as optional downloadable mod.

Since it's possible to install additional apps to NES Classic Mini hakchi2 can add not only "".nes"" files. You can also add external "".desktop"" files with all content and... any other file. Absolutely any file. But you'll need to enter full path to executable, so it's more like expert feature.
But there are bunch of predefined settings for formats like "".gbc"", "".gba"", "".gen"", "".n64"", etc. So you don't need to care about it if you wanna play other systems.

Additional changes:
- Total folder control. You can use folder tree constructor now to create folders, select images, rename and move everything as you want. Or just select predefined automatic algorithm. Thanks to NeoRame for images!
- Autofire feature updated a bit, since X and Y will be used often now.
- Optimization for large amount of games.
- Box art images will be load automatically if PNG or JPEG file with same name is available.
- English font updated, many characters added, so games like ""720°"" or ""Alien³"" will be shown without problems. Japanese font updated too, thanks to snakex!
- Game Genie database (thanks to Nhakin!), hakchi2 already contains database with many GG codes and you can import more from Nestopia.
- Box art images are with correct aspect ration now.
- Asiansteev fixed my terrible English :) Thanks!
- Many other improvements.
- Many fixes.

I hope that there are not so much bugs and you'll like it :)

- Multistep uploading. NES Mini can't handle huge kernel with hundreds of ROMs. So hakchi2 will split it up and upload in sequence. Just follow onscreen instructions.

- New patches for problem games.
- New confirmed mapper - 86. Also games with mappers 88, 95 and 206 will be patched automatically.
- Global command line arguments. You can add some argument(s) for all games at once, including original ones. For example: add ""_--ppu-palette=2_"" to make all games black and white.

- Start button simulation for second controller. Hold Up+A+B to press Start. It's workaround for some USA games on Famicom Mini. Don't forget to enable it via menu.
