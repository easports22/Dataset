## Highlights from this release include:
- User campaigns - It is now possible to create a series of levels that play together just like the original game.
- In game map editor - A new map editor is available directly from the game menu.
- Drug price impact - Patients will now react to the price you set for treatments. If treatments cost too much patients will opt to go home instead and this can affect your reputation.

- Machine smoke is now visible when machines are close to worn out.
- Right clicking the timer is now supported like in the original game for moving to affected patients - See issue #882 for details.

- The MP3 folder can now be unset from within the game. Previously after setting an mp3 folder it could only be removed by editing the config file by hand.
- Uses the proper cursor for resizing rooms.
- Bins can now be placed in the hallways.
- Temperature impact has been tweaked. The initial grace period has been removed and the overall impact has been softened.

## Notable bug fixes:
- Free build mode is now truly free - rooms used to cost money in this mode.
- In game movies will now work correctly on more hardware.
- Sound effects are no longer played when sound is disabled.
- VIP rewards have been tweaked to closer match expectations when the impression is mediocre.
- Crash when a patient is selected while they walk off the map is fixed.
- A room built next to an unowned parcel no longer loses its wall when the parcel is bought.
- Beta 1 regression that caused fired staff to continue to be paid has been patched.
- Beta 1 regression that caused the last cured emergency patient not to count has been patched.
- King complex patients only pay for their cure once.

- Properly load saves with more than one object on a tile.
- Do not get stuck in an infinite loop when no disease is available to spawn.

# Version 0.50 - released August 2015

The majority of changes in this update have been done under the hood.
Most of our third-party libraries have been updated, and especially Windows users will notice that there is now only one CorsixTH executable now. No more ""which one should I use if I want zoom?""!

## User Experience
- Added: Scroll speed can be configured in config.txt.
- Added: Lua version in the window caption.
- Change: Midi tracks are now played in the order they appear in MIDI.txt
- Change: Updated translations for most languages
- Change: Rendering engine is now determined automatically. Use SDL_RENDER_DRIVER environment variable to override the default.
- Fix: Potential crash from Esc-press before main menu.
- Fix: Audio stutter in certain movies.
- Fix: The game could sometimes crash when a movie had finished.
- Fix: handling of backspace and arrow keys in text boxes.
- Fix: Invalid path generated by font selector on linux
- Fix: Several crashes involving map bounds checks (dragging a blueprint, placing a staff member)

## Gameplay
- Added: Warning about untreatable diseases when the disease is enabled in the level file but the room is not.
- Change: Do not change the selected condition in drug casebook when new diseases are researched.
- Fix: Crash when trying to play certain sounds from e.g. the French version.
- Fix: Patients could in some circumstances get really confused and try to exit
  a room without putting any clothes on.
- Fix: Crash on the status report when there are no patients.
- Fix: Crash when editing room that litter has been dropped in.
- Fix: Crash when sending patients to the autopsy room and then building the needed room first
- FIx: Infinite loop condition in tryToFindNearbyPatients.

## Animation Viewer
- Added: A vertical scroll bar to the sprite display.

## CorsixTH development
- We have moved to newer versions of a lot of libraries, most notably
  SDL 1.2 -> SDL 2 and added support for Lua 5.2 and Lua 5.3.
- New ready-to-use Eclipse Workspace.
- Debugging Lua code using DBGp has been added. See
  the Wiki for more information.
- The Windows Installer now uses NSIS 3.0 and only produces one executable
  since SDL 2 handles renderer itself.
- Framework for Busted Unit Tests in Lua.
- Support for custom graphics has been improved.
- LibAV is supported as an alternative to FFMpeg. FFMpeg is still recommended.

For a full list of changes, see the [git log](https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH/compare/v0.40...v0.50).

- New ready-to-use Eclipse Workspace.
- Debugging Lua code using DBGp has been added. See
  the Wiki for more information.

## MapEdit

MapEdit is no longer being shipped with CorsixTH. In the future it will be replaced by a brand new map editor built right into the game. In the mean time we recommend that level makers keep a copy of the CorsixTH 0.40 files in another location.

Watch out for epidemics on the later levels in the campaign! Your patients are not as good as they used to be either, so those who are not lucky enough to get vaccinated and cured might get a visit from the Grim Reaper.

Also, don't forget to try out the new map St. Peter's near Cawley!

Happy gaming!

## Gameplay
- Added: Epidemics. You can either choose to pay a fine to the authorities or try to cover up the epidemic by vaccinating and curing the contagious patients. Patients going between buildings will NOT trigger the alarm to the authorities.

- Fix: Patients could die inside a room. They will now die outside the room unless they are just being cured.
- Fix: If winning the level at end of year the annual report would hide the winning fax.
- Fix: If there was no queue to a room a leaving staff member would not trigger a call for staff for the patient who had to abort their procedure in that room.
- Fix: If a handyman had pending tasks when he died in an exploding room the game could crash.
- Fix: A surgeon that is removed in mid-operation will now get properly replaced by a new one.
- Fix: If the GP room was built too early in the tutorial the game would crash when building a GP room later on if debug mode was turned off.
- Fix: Patients would try to enter an exploding room. As you can imagine, this was bad.
- Fix: Psychiatrists would become shut-ins and just wander about their office forever.

  with gracious hair.

This release contains a whole new experimental Level Editor, which means that in combination
with the already existing Map Editor you can now create whole levels a lot easier. Give it a try! 

![leveledit](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3106122/1805056/71d7f31e-6c71-11e3-95f2-52291f92915e.png)
Find the executable in the install directory.

We have also added many new options, previously only
available by manually editing the config file, to the options dialog.

Players will also notice (once we release the version after this one) that we have added an automatic update check on game launch.

As usual there are of course finally numerous minor tweaks here and there. 

**Changelog**

_Gameplay_
- Change: You can now build more than one desk in the ward. More nurses means
  a slightly faster throughput.
- Change: Patients would previously queue outside toilets even though there were
  free loos since it was dependant on number of people in the room. Now, as soon
  as a loo becomes free another patient enters the room to use it, 
  even if there is a long queue for the sink). 
  If there is a queue for the sinks there is a chance the patient will leave 
  without washing their hands - but will not be happy about doing this. 
- Added: The ability to control alien behaviour - sitting, knocking doors, 
  only to be available through emergency or arrive like all other patients.
- Added: Winning fax opens automatically and pauses the game.
- Added: Option to automatically accept wage increase requests when they ""time out"".
- Added: A new option allows for your average build content for each type of room 
  to be remembered, so will be added for each new room built later.  
- Fix: Doctors should get stuck less often, and handymen should not crash the
  game as frequently.
- Fix: It was not possible to replace a surgeon when a patient was in the room.
- Fix: Patients would sometimes get stuck inside a room when they should 
  have died.

_User Interface_
- Added: A new customization menu in the Options dialog. Most options from the
  configuration file are now available for change in-game.
- Added: A new directory menu in the Options dialog.
- Added: The game does now check for a more recent version of itself when
  launching.
- Added: A helpful message when the player puts more Researchers in the
  research department than there are desks.
- Added: The game now does a small integrity check on the Theme Hospital
  files to make sure that the most common corruptions are not present.
- Added: Confirm dialog to the quit/exit button on the main menu.
- Fix: The tooltip for the tutorial button was incorrect since the dialog
  has been visually changed.
- Fix: The announcer has had a few corrections made to his manuscripts.
  He is very happy about this!
- Removed: The settings menu is no longer available from within the game.

_Hotkeys_

Some hotkeys have been changed and/or added:
- Alt + A = Toggle Announcements
- Alt + M = Toggle Music
- Alt + S = Toggle Sound Effects
- Shift and + to zoom in five steps and Shift and - to zoom out five steps at a time.

_Campaign levels_
- Fix: An error in level 8 made it possible to win without meeting the
  reputation criterion.

_Custom levels_
- Change: For random emergencies each illness now has its own average number of
  patients to spawn. Previously they were all the same.
- Fix: Researching improvements was not really possible on some custom levels,
  i.e. if the map creator had made it so there were no machines at the start. 

_Demo files_
- Fix: When winning the demo level CorsixTH looked for another level to load,
  showing the wrong fax options and eventually crashing. 

_Languages_
- Added: Korean language.
- Fix: It was not possible to dump strings for a language with unicode 
  characters in the name.

_Compiling_
- Fix: You could not compile the game with WITH_AUDIO=0 if SDL_mixer was
  not present at all.
- Fix: WITH_AUDIO=OFF is now illegal in combination with WITH_MOVIES=ON.

Known issue: The enter key does not work as a shortcut and the Start and Cancel buttons are misplaced at the Campaign menu.

Android: If you would like to try out the game on your Android device you can find Alan Woolley´s excellent port on Google Play or on his blog (http://www.armedpineapple.co.uk/projects/corsixth-for-android/). Note that it is in its own experimental stage at the moment.

**Changelog**

This is mainly a bugfix release, but a few minor features are still also introduced, see the changelog below.
Gameplay

```
Fix: Staff would sometimes not go for a break.
Fix: A few crashes related to Handymen.
Fix: An error could occur if a fax message was removed just as it was animating into view.
Fix: Patients could sometimes be told to go home multiple times, resulting in a crash.
Fix: If a queueing patient was heading for a drinks machine just as the player moved that machine the game would crash. 
```

User Interface

```
Added: Scrolling momentum when using the middle button.
Added: There is now a clock in the right corner of the menu bar that shows the real world time. It can be toggled between AM/PM and 24h in the configuration file. 
```

Hotkeys

```
Added: Hotkeys for the Jukebox (J), Save game menu (Shift + S), Load game menu (Shift + L), to restart the level (Shift + R) and finally quit the current game and take you back to the opening screen (Shift + Q). 

Change: Restart is now Shift + F10 instead of only F10.
Change: Toggle adviser is now Shift + A instead of only A.
Change: Key combinations will only trigger if that exact combination is pressed. E.g. Ctrl + R will not trigger R too.
Change: Alt + F4 is now the hotkey to quit CorsixTH. 

Fix: Added a configuration option to have the possibility to use Shift + C as hotkey to open the Drug casebook instead of C. This is to workaround a bug that when you press on the volume down key on your keyboard the Drug casebook would open. 
```

Map Editor

```
Added: Undo/Redo functionality.
Added: Street lamps and the dead looking tree.
