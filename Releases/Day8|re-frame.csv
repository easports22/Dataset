  - added [API documentation](/docs/API.md)

#### Breaking

  - [#357](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/pull/357)
    I'd be amazed if this actually broke any apps. Shocked! But, better safe than sorry. 
    The effect handler for `:db` has changed: if the new value provided tests
    `identical?` to the existing value within `app-db`, then `app-db` is not `reset!`. 
    Previously, `app-db` was always `reset!` irrespective, 
    which potentially caused Layer 2 subscriptions to run unnecessarily. So this is a tiny 
    efficiency change in this edge case, and it results in behaviour that better matches 
    programmer intuitions.

#### Minor Fixes and Improvements

 - [#400](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/pull/400) Improve error message when a registered cofx can't be found
 - The effect handler for `:dispatch-n` will now ignore `nils`. [See checkin](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/commit/6efdae438f393f8121a2d6dfbf76db00e6dafbf5)
 - [#340](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/pull/340)
 - [#341](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/pull/341) Fix `re-frame.core/on-changes` to work even if event handler does not set `:db`.
