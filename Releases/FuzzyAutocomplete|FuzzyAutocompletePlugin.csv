- Support for Xcode 6 and Swift
- Correct Word Order by two-pass matching, useful when:

- Option to hide cursor when inline preview shows a non-prefix match
- Keep the selection when narrowing the search (unless it was the best match)
- Better inline previews, including token text, just without tokens
