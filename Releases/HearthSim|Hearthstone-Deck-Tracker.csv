---
- **The LogReader performance improvements _may_ cause problems on some systems. Please let me know if this is the case for you.**
- Quite a bit of code was restructured. Possibly breaks plugins again in cases where anything outside of the API is used (I'm so sorry!). If you notice that or any odd behaviours please also let me know. 

---

**New**:
- Tooltips and searching for cards now support multiple languages. To enable these see `options > tracker > appearance > card language`.

**Changes/Fixes:**
- Updated for 10357
  - No longer crashes at the end of Tavern Brawl games.
  - Stats now show games for non-default heroes.
  - Replays are now saved for non-default heroes.
- LogReader performance improvements (this should fix issues where HDT would slow down the more games were played in a session).
- Fixed an issue where the ""wrong deck detected"" dialog would keep popping up after ""keep using active deck"" was selected.
- Fixed an issue where exporting would miss cards if ""prioritize golden cards"" was turned off and the collection contained one standard and one golden card.
- Fixed several web imports.
- Fixed an issue where the secret opacity slider would not load properly.
- Fixed issues related to turn detection and `UNKNOWN HUMAN PLAYER`.
- Fixed a crash that would occasionally happen when adding the last arena card.

**API:**

- Fixed an issue where the ""pop up hearthstone on turn start"" option would not work most of the time. (`options > tracker > general`)
- Fixed multiple crashes.
- Fixed log file backups.
- log.config changes: added `Achievements` and set `Verbose=true` in preperation for future features.

1791522,2015-09-10T12:14:20Z,2015-09-10T12:14:13Z,Release v0.11.0,"**New:**
- As you can probably tell: Now with in-app update notes.

**Fixes/Changes:**
- Fixed most (if not all) lag/micro stuttering issues with Hearthstone (more on that below).
- Fixed a lot of things regarding card tracking. 
- Fixed gold progress tracking.
- Fixed deck screnshots for DPI settings over 100%.
- Fixed an issue where secrets of other classes would not be displayed.
- Fixed an issue where the overlay would show on up other Unity windows. (You can still enable `options > tracker > settings > advanced window search` if it does not work for some reason)
- Fixed an issue where HDT would crash at the end of a game when no deck was selected and the hero replaced (Rag/Jaraxxus). 
- Fixed an issue where HDT would crash when constructed importing had no class cards.
- Fixed an issue where HDT would crash when trying to delete zero matches in the duplicate dialog.
- Fixed an issue where HDT would crash when trying to access the gold progress in `CHINA` region.
- Fixed an issue where HDT would crash crash silently with new configs in special cases.
- Fixed an issue where HDT would crash when problems loading the CardDB files occur.
- Fixed an issue where arena games would be uploaded twice.
- Improved performance when Hearthstone is not running.
- Removed the ""K""-Cardmark.

**More on the lag/micro stuttering**:
- Instead of using the `output_log.txt` HDT now gathers it's data from the `Hearthstone/Logs/*.log` files. For this the `log.config` was changed to only use FilePrinting instead of ConsolePrinting. If you for need ConsolePrinting enabled for some reason, you can set `LogConfigConsolePrinting` in the `config.xml`.

**API:**
- Due to the LogReader changes, `API.LogEvents.OnLogLine` no longer exists but is now split into `API.LogEvents.OnPowerLogLine`, `API.LogEvents.OnBobLogLine`, etc. If you need other log types I suggest manually creating a new `LogReader.LogReader` instance.

- Possibly fixed an issue where the execution path would be wrong, causing the tracker to crash.
- Fixed, when exporting decks to Hearthstone (french): Lightning bolt, Silence.
- Overlay no longer pops up at start if Hearthstone is not running.
- Removed ""game logging"" with the addition of stats tracking.

**Known issues / workarounds:**
- Switching decks during a game causes actions to be recorded multiple times.
- If stats tracking does not work properly, restart Heartstone and the Tracker once.
- Overwriting a deck using a new deck with the same name keeps the old stats.
- Turn number seems to not get recorded correctly sometimes.
- Doubleclicking in the Stats > Overview or the ""Result""-row in Stats > Games causes the Tracker to crash.

- Fixed cards getting removed from deck even though the option was not enabled (main reason for this update).
- Fixed cards gettings removed from deck that were not supposed to (with option enabled).
- Fixed cards from e.g. tracking being treated as ""obtained"" and removed when played if the option was enabled.
- Fixed deck count when ""include obtained"" is enabled
- Fixed deck not updating properly when turning ""remove when count is 0"" on/off
- Added missing cards to additional overlay tooltips (bane of doom, power of the horde)

_known issues:_  
- _cards returned from the battlefield (cancelled battlecry, sap, shadowstep, brew, etc) are counted as ""obtained"" if that option is enabled_
- _Closing the tracker while it's minimized causes it to not appear when started the next time (also if done before the update). Same goes for the ""additional windows"".  
  Workarounds for now:  
  a) don't close it while it's minimized :),  
  b) if you did, **alt-tab to the tracker and press Win-(Right Arrow) if you're on Win7/8, or Alt+Space+X for vista** until you see it._

### **If you can't see the tracker after starting, read above**

Sorry for the inconvenience, that'll be fixed with the next update.

**Features:**
- Added additional tooltips in the overlay for Ysera, ETC, Gelbin Mekkatorque and Animal Companion, which display the drawable cards / summonable minions. (Can be disabled in Options > General > Overlay)
- If the last game was played in ""No Deck""-mode, the drawn cards can now be imported as a new deck (New Deck > Import > From last game). Mainly meant for arena.
- Option to include ""obtained cards"" in the playercards (coin, from thoughtsteal, etc) - the feature above ignores these. (_known issue: enabling this currently throws off the deck-count_)
- Using ""Remove cards if count is 0"" and ""Highlight cards in hand"" now only removes a card if it's no longer in hand.
- When trying to save a new deck with an existing name (e.g. ""Arena""), an option to overwrite the deck is presented.

**Fixes/Changes:**
- Performance improvements
- Fixed an issue where secrets were only clickable if overlay tooltips were enabled.
- Removed message balloon when minimizing to tray.
- Fixed timer window size not being saved proplerly.
- Fixed saving window positions with multiple screens.
- Hearthstones Log now gets cleared after every game. (Can be disabled in the config file if needed)

**New Feature:**
You can now ""export"" your decks to Hearthstone. Not quite sure what to call it. (Button for it is in the top-right in My Decks)

Select a deck in the tracker, click ""Export to HS"" (it'll tell you to create a new deck in hs and leave the creation screen open) and the tracker will create the selected deck in Hearthstone.
Can be combined very nicely with importing decks from hearthpwn and hearthstats!

This is done purely via mouseclick/keystroke simulations (just like any macro tool), so don't worry, **no memory-editing-shenanigans happening**.

Does currently not work with golden cards (unless you don't have any non-golden, then yes) because without image recognition there is just no way to do it correctly.

If you/the tracker mess up and is not actually adding in the cards, don't panic and just let it finish.

I tested with all resolitions and it seems to work with all of them. 
**If it does however not hit the cards/searchbox for you or is too fast:** open the config and mess with the values at the bottom. Delays are in milliseconds, the x/y values are percentages. <SearchBoxX>0.5</SearchBoxX> means it clicks at 50% of your screen-width.

I could not really test ""real"" fullscreen, as my hearthstone does not go into ""real"" fullscreen for some reason.
It restores the window before starting the exporting though, so it should work I think (worst case, if it doesn't, should be a message telling you it can't find the hearthstone window).

-Options are now no longer cluttering the main window.
+The overlay can be disabled completely
+Added an option to show player and opponent cards in seperate (nontransparent) windows. These can be used for streaming! There is also a <WindowBackgroundHex> value in the config.xml now, where the backgroundcolor for these 2 windows can be set (e.g. #FF00FF for magenta). The main purpose for this is the use with a colorkey for that window in OBS.
