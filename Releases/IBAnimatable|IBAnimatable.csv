3378130,2016-06-06T03:06:33Z,2016-06-06T03:11:18Z,2.3,"This is a big release, we have added 52 transition animations. After this release transition animation APIs are stable.

We also fixed some bugs and added some designable features.

Great thanks to [@tbaranes](https://github.com/tbaranes) who ported all transitions from [VCTransitionsLibrary](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/VCTransitionsLibrary) and added parameters support for some transition animators.

#### API breaking changes
