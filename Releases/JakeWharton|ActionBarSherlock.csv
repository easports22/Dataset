- Added `ActionBarSherlock.Activity`, `ActionBarSherlock.FragmentActivity`,
  and `ActionBarSherlock.ListActivity` for extension by implementing
  activities, the latter of which is deprecated. This affords a much tighter
  integration and allows for the use of other new features listed below.
- New API method: `layout(Fragment)` will use the fragment argument as the
  content to the activity.
- New API method: `menu(int)` allows for the inflation of menu XMLs from a
  resource. For the non-native implementation, the XML can be inflated to a
  custom Menu which can then be applied appropriately to the third-party
  action bar. Sub-menus are also supported. Third-party action bar handlers
  should implement `ActionBarSherlock.HasMenu` for this functionality. _This
  feature requires that activities extend from one of the provided activity
  base classes._
- New API method: `homeAsUp(boolean)`. This mimics the native method
  `setDisplayHomeAsUpEnalbed` on the native action bar. Third-party action bar
  handlers should implement `ActionBarSherlock.HasHomeAsUp` for this
  functionality.
- New API method: `useLogo(boolean)` will trigger the action bar to hide the
  application icon/home button and title and show a larger logo representing
  the application. Third-party action bar handlers should implement
  `ActionBarSherlock.HasLogo` for this functionality.
- New API method: `listNavigation(SpinnerAdapter, OnNavigationListener)`. Tells
  the action bar to use drop-down style navigation with the specified list of
  items and callback listener. Third-party action bar handlers should
  implement `ActionBarSherlock.HasListNavigation` for this functionality.
- Javadocs are now available at
  [jakewharton.github.com/ActionBarSherlock](http://jakewharton.github.com/ActionBarSherlock/).
- A standalone JAR is now available via the
  [GitHub downloads page](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock/downloads)

in how this library handles themes. If you were using a custom style for
`actionBarStyle` you must now specify its attributes in the root of the theme
and prefix them with 'ab'.

`samples/demos/res/values/styles.xml`.
- Library now uses the `r3` version of the compatibility library for its base.
- `actionBarStyle` is no longer a valid theme attribute (see note above).

  `samples/demos/` and merged in the old 'featuredemo'.
- Dividers are now shown on pre-3.0 devices between all action items.
- `Window.FEATURE_ACTION_BAR_OVERLAY` is now honored on pre-3.0 devices.
- Inflation of XML menu resources will now honor `android:actionLayout` and
  `android:actionViewClass` attributes.
- Buttons for displaying the determinate and indeterminate progress bars have

- Added support for indeterminate progress bar. Due to the `final` modifier on
