- Removes duplicate videos.

NOTE: The manifest loaded from Apple includes some video files twice, although with different names. Aerial now goes through and does a HEAD request to all videos to get their content lengths and culls the list with that added information. Takes a second longer to start the screensaver, so I'll be looking into caching this in the future.
