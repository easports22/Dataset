Changes since **[V3.0.4.1](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/3.0.4.1)**:

- ASF OS-specific packages are now link-time optimized with **[monolinker](https://github.com/mono/linker)**, which removes unnecessary .NET Core runtime dependencies and results in smaller overall size.
- Usual amount of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

- Removed `CardDropsRestricted` and added `HoursUntilCardDrops` **[bot config property](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)** with default value of `3` in its place [1].
- ASF is now available as official **[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/justarchi/archisteamfarm)** container, check **[wiki](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Docker)** for more info (ref: #661, #670).
- Added `Changelog.html` and `ConfigGenerator.html` helper links to the ASF folder.
- Added `!ib`, `!ibadd` and `!ibrm` **[commands](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**.
- Heavily improved redeeming function that now will take in account `RateLimited` bots and won't attempt to forward/distribute keys to them anymore, saving time and failing requests.
- Slightly improved code responsible for ensuring that `SteamLogin` and `SteamPassword` fields are valid.
- Slightly improved code responsible for accepting trades sent from `SendOnFarmingFinished` + `ShutdownOnFarmingFinished` bots.
- `!update` command will now properly state success and failure.
- Fixed quite important regression introduced in V3.0.2.4 that could make ASF trying to redeem given key infinitely when there are no more bots to try.
- Fixed `!resume` not working for users with `Operator` `SteamUserPermissions`.
- Fixed priority idling queue not always working properly.
- Fixed ASF auto-update feature not working when custom `--path` was specified.
- Usual amount of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

> It's important to note that in the past `HoursUntilCardDrops` was only `0` or `2`, and this is why ASF had a single `CardDropsRestricted` property that allowed to switch between those two values. With recent changes we noticed that not only majority of users require `3` hours in place of previous `2` now, but also that `HoursUntilCardDrops` is now dynamic and can hit any value on per-account basis.

Changes since **[V3.0.3.0](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/3.0.3.0)**:

- [!] Rewrote ASF basic IPC interface to use EmbedIO. If you find any issues with IPC, report them in #667.
- ASF is now available as official **[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/justarchi/archisteamfarm)** container, check **[wiki](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Docker)** for more info (ref: #661).
- Added `Changelog.html` and `ConfigGenerator.html` helper links to the ASF folder.
- Heavily improved redeeming function that now will take in account `RateLimited` bots and won't attempt to forward/distribute keys to them anymore, saving time and failing requests.
- Slightly improved code responsible for ensuring that `SteamLogin` and `SteamPassword` fields are valid.
- `!update` command will now properly state success and failure.
- Fixed quite important regression introduced in V3.0.2.4 that could make ASF trying to redeem given key infinitely when there are no more bots to try.
- Fixed `!resume` not working for users with `Operator` `SteamUserPermissions`.
- Fixed priority idling queue not always working properly.
- Usual amount of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

- [!] Fixed wrong `SteamTradeMatcher` dupes logic (ref: #657) [1].
- ASF Windows variant now includes (once again) proper icon. Other variants might make use of `ArchiSteamFarm.ico` that is now added to the release.

- IPC will now follow standard alphabetical bot sorting order when used without target bot instance.

[1] A potential attacker could force ASF into accepting a non-neutral+ (bad) trade by exploiting wrongly coded dupes logic condition, as explained in #657. Therefore, all older ASF versions (including V2) are considered **insecure** and it's strongly recommended to update if you're making use of `SteamTradeMatcher` feature.

[1] As stated on the wiki:
> ASF will ""join"" extra out-of-range arguments to plural type of the last in-range argument. This means that `!redeem bot key1 key2 key3` for `!redeem <Bots> <Keys>` will work exactly the same as `!redeem bot key1,key2,key3`. Together with accepting newline as command delimiter, this makes it possible for you to write `!redeem bot` then paste a list of keys separated by any acceptable delimiter character (such as newline), or standard `,` ASF delimiter.

This makes it possible not only to use other args delimiter, such as the newline, but also map out-of-range arguments into the last one, making the following behaviour possible:

- Fixed possible ASF crash that could happen when being unable to decrypt both password and login key.
- Fixed `!leave` command missing `<Bots>` syntax.
- Removed obsolete and undocumented ASF V0 command-less method of redeeming keys.
- Usual amount of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

**Notice for Linux/OS X users:** Old ASF might crash with `'Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib' threw an exception` during updating to this version. This is one-time issue that is already fixed in new ASF code, simply `chmod +x ArchiSteamFarm` after crash and launch as usual, you'll already have latest version. Sorry for the inconvenience.

[1] ASF will now automatically check each 6 hours if given account can obtain cards through clearing discovery queue. If yes, ASF will automatically do that on as-needed basis. The code should also work for future sales, assuming Valve won't change any core implementation.

Entire thing is done automatically, in load-balanced way across all `Enabled` accounts. First bot will check its discovery queue in around 1 minute since program launch. Like with logging in or sending trades, whether asking/clearing discovery queue actually succeeds or not is out of the ASF concern.

Changes since **[V2.3.2.0](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/2.3.2.0)**:

- [!] ASF now runs on .NET Core, see **[V3 migration](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/V3-Migration)**.
- [!] Added support for automatic Steam discovery queue [1].
- Added `Random` `FarmingOrder` to **[bot configuration properties](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)**.
- Fixed ASF not aborting farming in `Complex` mode when getting disconnected from Steam network.
- `GiftsLimiterDelay` will now also apply to `!redeem` and `!addlicense` requests (ref: #577).
- `Forwarding` `RedeemingPreferences` will now also respect `SteamUserPermissions`.
- ASF will now automatically include your trading token if you participate in our **[public listing](http://asf.justarchi.net/STM)**.
- Misc code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

[1] ASF will now automatically check each 6 hours if given account can obtain cards through clearing discovery queue. If yes, ASF will automatically do that on as-needed basis. The code should also work for future sales, assuming Valve won't change any core implementation.

Entire thing is done automatically, in load-balanced way across all `Enabled` accounts. First bot will check its discovery queue in around 1 minute since program launch. Like with logging in or sending trades, whether asking/clearing discovery queue actually succeeds or not is out of the ASF concern.

Huge thanks to all my **[patrons](http://patreon.com/JustArchi)** that made this release possible.

- Improved `ShutdownOnFarmingFinished` that previously didn't work properly with `0` `IdleFarmingPeriod` (ref: #557).
- Improved Steam message splitting logic that should now always arrive in proper order when Bot is forced to split the message because of its size.
- Fixed ASF attempting to start broken (config/database) bots.
- Further fixed WCF maximum message length (ref: #484).
- Usual code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

- ASF will now respect permissions when distributing/forwarding keys and won't send keys to bots that given user doesn't have access to.
- ASF will now try to avoid using `HandleOfflineMessages` if it can be sure that there is no offline message from any user permitted to use ASF commands, potentially making it possible to use for primary accounts.
- `!pause` command will now properly deactivate also `GamesPlayedWhileIdle`.
- Improved `ShutdownOnFarmingFinished` that previously didn't work properly with `0` `IdleFarmingPeriod` (ref: #557).
- Improved Steam message splitting logic that should now always arrive in proper order when Bot is forced to split the message because of its size.
- Fixed ASF attempting to start broken (config/database) bots.
- Further fixed WCF maximum message length (ref: #484).
- Usual code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

[1] This was done due to the fact of adding new operator permission in PR #500 - initially it was limited to a single person, like `SteamMasterID`. Due to the fact that it could make sense to promote multiple operators for a single bot instance, it was a good idea to rewrite it in a way that would allow to specify multiple people instead of just a single account. And due to the fact that I had to create another collection anyway, it no longer made sense to separate ""masters"" from ""operators"", so I unified permissions in a single property which is now called `SteamUserPermissions` and allows to declare any number of people with any permission set. This means that you'll need to re-generate your configs, as old `SteamMasterID` is ☠️ . Please read explanation of `SteamUserPermissions` **[bot config property](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)** for further details.

[2] Due to the fact that `!api <Bots>` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)** now exists, it didn't make sense to keep old `!api` command that works the same as new `!api ASF`. For consistency, old `!api` command now affects only current bot instance, same like all other commands, and old behaviour of `!api` can now be achieved with `!api ASF`.

[3] For some reason it's entirely possible that invalid (no longer available/possible) trades are filling up our trading queue and not allowing us to make any new trades before manually opening ""trades sent"" page once and trying again. ASF now automatically does that before sending a trade. Please note that it has nothing to do with valid (available/possible) trades being in ""ready to accept"" or ""awaiting confirmation"" state.

[4] Newer compiler might generate better code than the old one, leading to small performance/memory benefits.

Changes since **[V2.2.3.7](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/2.2.3.7)**:
- [!] Reworked permissions, this is a breaking change [1].
- [!] Changed behaviour of `!api` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**, this is a breaking change [2].
- Added `!api <Bots>` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)** (ref: #485).
- Added extra workaround for invalidating old trades [3].
- Fixed ASF compilation on OS X, also added OS X as a test platform to our **[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm)**.
- ASF release is now compiled with latest Visual Studio 2017 by our **[AppVeyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JustArchi/archisteamfarm)** (previously: VS15).
- Major code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

---

[1] This was done due to the fact of adding new operator permission in PR #500 - initially it was limited to a single person, like `SteamMasterID`. Due to the fact that it could make sense to promote multiple operators for a single bot instance, it was a good idea to rewrite it in a way that would allow to specify multiple people instead of just a single account. And due to the fact that I had to create another collection anyway, it no longer made sense to separate ""masters"" from ""operators"", so I unified permissions in a single property which is now called `SteamUserPermissions` and allows to declare any number of people with any permission set. This means that you'll need to re-generate your configs, as old `SteamMasterID` is ☠️ . Please read explanation of `SteamUserPermissions` **[bot config property](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)** for further details.

[2] Due to the fact that `!api <Bots>` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)** now exists, it didn't make sense to keep old `!api` command that works the same as new `!api ASF`. For consistency, old `!api` command now affects only current bot instance, same like all other commands, and old behaviour of `!api` can now be achieved with `!api ASF`.

[3] For some reason it's entirely possible that invalid (no longer available/possible) trades are filling up our trading queue and not allowing us to make any new trades before manually opening ""trades sent"" page once and trying again. ASF now automatically does that before sending a trade.

[1] ASF is a service (daemon). When user launches the program then he desires that it'll keep running also when he's away from PC. If that is not desired, you can close ASF when you expect OS to go to sleep, use `ShutdownOnFarmingFinished`, or any third-party tool which would close ASF whenever you want. The improvement introduced with this change will give a hint to Windows OS (yes, not working on Mono, sorry) that we wish to stay active and prevent OS from going to sleep while the program is running - this is  built-in and active automatically when ASF is running (regardless if as a service, or not).

[2] ASF will now skip reporting accounts with non-public/empty inventories, as well as include in the request number of cards you have. When a version with this change goes stable, public ASF STM listing will no longer accept requests from outdated clients that are missing this info. The objective of this change is to purge bots with empty inventories from listing, as well as sorting them according to number of items in inventory.

[3] This property was added when ASF 2FA existed in solo + import mode, and the purpose was automatic accept of confirmations in solo mode. Due to the fact that ASF 2FA exists only in import mode since quite a while, and user should be using authenticator of his choice for all 2FA-related tasks, this property is no longer inside ASF 2FA scope, and should be removed to avoid confusion. Yet another reason for this is the fact that it actually didn't work **at all** since **almost 5 months** and nobody even found out.

From non-ASF things it's also worth mentioning that AppVeyor will now automatically deploy all ASF releases on GitHub, simplyfing the work I usually have to do. Stable releases will be manually promoted from pre-releases when the time is right (as usual). I also cut the Crowdin spam in the commits (ref: #431).

Changes since **[V2.2.2.4](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/2.2.2.4)**:
- From now on running ASF will prevent Windows OS from going to sleep [1].
- Added back metadata publishing to all WCF bindings.
- `DismissInventoryNotifications` is now `false` by default.
- `AcceptDonations` can now be used together with `DontAcceptBotTrades` in `TradingPreferences`.
- Fixed ASF crash on invalid `IdentitySecret`/`SharedSecret` in ASF 2FA.
- Updated **[statistics and privacy policy](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Statistics#current-privacy-policy)** [2].
- Updated internal SteamKit2 code, this results in some misc changes of `!redeem` statuses. I took the opportunity and **[documented them in the FAQ](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ)** while I was at it.
- Major code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
- [Non-ASF] AppVeyor will now automatically deploy all ASF releases on GitHub, simplyfing the work I usually have to do. Stable releases will be manually promoted from pre-releases when the time is right (as usual).

---

[1] ASF is a service (daemon), when user launches the program then he desires that it'll keep running also when he's away from PC. If that is not desired, you can close ASF when you expect OS to go to sleep, use `ShutdownOnFarmingFinished`, or any third-party tool which would close ASF whenever you want.

[2] ASF will now skip reporting accounts with non-public/empty inventories, as well as include in the request number of cards you have. When a version with this change goes stable, public ASF STM listing will no longer accept requests from outdated clients that are missing this info.

[1] Translations are still work-in-progress and their quality will improve over time. If you want to help, be it because ASF is not available in your language yet, or because you spotted some incorrect/bad translation, please visit **[localization](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Localization)** and contribute! 👍 

[2] In the past ASF was very ""liberal"" towards networking issues, it was forgiving even for most awful timeouts and invalid responses, which could lead to a situation such as Bot (its Steam client) being completely unresponsive due to networking, with no way to bring it back up to operative state without entire ASF restart. This was especially painful for server usages of ASF, as ASF had no real defense against this, which directly affected main ASF aspect - its reliability.

Starting with this release, ASF is much less forgiving for such issues, which will lead to fixed ASF patience when it comes to unresponsive Steam client, or Steam network. In short, if ASF didn't get any packet from Steam network in last minute, ASF will send a request to Steam network requesting it to respond. This will be attemted several number of times (6 with default `ConnectionTimeout`), then if no response arrives, ASF will assume that Steam client/network is down, and attempt a reconnect. If no packet arrived for reconnect attempt in given timeout (2 minutes with default `ConnectionTimeout`) either, entire Steam client is abandoned and re-created in order to fight with the situation described above. This considers only a situation of networking being alive, but in ""corrupted"" state - if your OS reports no network/connection being lost, ASF is still aware of this and as long as Steam client is operative (e.g. attempts to reconnect), no action will be taken.

What it means to you? It means that depending on both your network, and Steam network stability, you might see increased number of failed HeartBeats, reconnect attemps and ASF abandoning Steam client instances. This does not mean that the issue suddenly arrived with this ASF version - because it was here for the entire time, older ASF simply ignored it to some degree and patiently waited for situation to fix itself, which very often didn't fix itself, rendering ASF bot unusable. You can control ASF patience to some degree with `ConnectionTimeout`, as described in Configuration section on the wiki, and most likely you will need to do so if your network is extremely unstable. Overall this change should improve ASF reliability and responsiveness greatly, even if for the cost of increased number of reconnect attempts and being less forgiving towards networking issues.

[1] I said many times that this is out of the scope of ASF, and somehow I still believe that it's so, but I also got many people asking for this for a long time, and once Steam sale finally started, I had enough of data to test and implement this.

ASF will automatically check each 6 hours if account should vote and/or explore discovery queue. If yes - ASF will do that for extra 3 sale cards each day. There is lots of debugging that helps me to check if everything is working like it should, I left it intentionally for you so you could see if it's working.

**I do not plan to release any stable release with this in near future**. This is **nowhere close** to be called stable, and I won't offer any support for this, neither accept any bugs-reporting. If it works for you, that's great, if not, sorry - out of the scope. This feature will automatically disappear 2nd January 18:00 UTC (Sale ending), and then **maybe** I will call at least queue discovery stable enough to land in stable ASF release next sale.

If this addition works for you and you're enjoying it, don't forget to donate. I spent a while doing this, and put it in ASF for free, even though I could keep it for myself or sell to people that offered me much more than I'm usually making from ASF donations as a whole. ASF is and will always be available **for free**, but my willings to code features out of the scope of the program are pretty limited and usually depend on donations and positive feedback - you didn't disappoint me so far, and I appreciate it, that's why you get this feature in for no cost, out of my free will 😃 .

- [!] Removed `ForwardKeysToOtherBots` and `DistributeKeys` - it's unified under new `RedeemingPreferences` **[bot config property](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)**.
- [!] Added new `LootableTypes` **[bot config property](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)**.
- [!] `IsBotAccount` no longer controls looting foil cards, the responsibility now lies in newly introduced `LootableTypes`.
- Added experimental feature of auto-queue discovery and SteamAwards voting [1].
- Added rough approximation of expected farming time, to `!status` and alike (also **[API](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/API)**).
- Fixed statistics reporting not working on older versions of Mono.
- Fixed rare issue that could lead to ASF not connecting to Steam Network.
- Fixed ASF not parsing command-line arguments when running as a service.
- Removed `ForceHttp` global config property. For reasoning, see **[commit](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/commit/cc317e10a8f1c71a16b0c577ddb0976adc244d71)**.
- Usual code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

[1] I said many times that this is out of the scope of ASF, and somehow I still believe that it's so, but I also got many people asking for this for a long time, and once Steam sale finally started, I had enough of data to test and implement this.

ASF will automatically check each 6 hours if account should vote and/or explore discovery queue. If yes - ASF will do that for extra 3 sale cards each day. There is lots of debugging that helps me to check if everything is working like it should, I left it intentionally for you so you could see if it's working.

**I do not plan to release any stable release with this in near future**. This is **nowhere close** to be called stable, and I won't offer any support for this, neither accept any bugs-reporting. If it works for you, that's great, if not, sorry - out of the scope. This feature will automatically disappear 2nd January 18:00 UTC (Sale ending), and then **maybe** I will call at least queue discovery stable enough to land in stable ASF release next sale.

If this addition works for you and you're enjoying it, don't forget to donate. I spent a while doing this, and put it in ASF for free, even though I could keep it for myself or sell to people that offered me much more than I'm usually making from ASF donations as a whole. ASF is and will always be available **for free**, but my willings to code features out of the scope of the program are pretty limited and usually depend on donations and positive feedback - you didn't disappoint me so far, and I appreciate it, that's why you get this feature in for no cost, out of my free will 😃 .

ASF is available for free. If you're grateful for what we're doing, please consider donating. Developing ASF requires massive amount of time and knowledge, especially when it comes to Steam (and it's problems). Even 1$ is highly appreciated and shows that you care!

- [!] Redeem order of `ForwardKeysToOtherBots` and `DistributeKeys` has been changed [1].
- It's now possible to use `CustomGamePlayedWhileIdle` and `GamesPlayedWhileIdle` at the same time, to play specific `appIDs` while showing custom status in Steam Network. Please note that the order of display is not guaranteed in this case.
- Added new `CustomGamePlayedWhileFarming` bot config property, which is possible thanks to above change. Visit **[Configuration](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)** for more info.
- Greatly improved efficiency of handling multiple 2FA confirmations by adapting newly introduced multi-confirm method introduced by Valve. Thanks to that, ASF can send just one request for accepting all confirmations, instead of accepting them one-by-one.
- Slightly improved internal cd-key validator to be case-insensitive and more precise.
- Usual portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

[1] Up to now ASF considered every currently enabled and running bot for keys forwarding and distributing. This method was OK as it didn't depend on any particular order and always made sure that every bot gets the key. However, often we want to slightly modify the order of keys redeeming, for instance by excluding keys forwarding to our main account - this is now possible.

In order to avoid another messy config property, the actual logic has been modified and now takes in account the bot that receives keys. That bot will firstly try to redeem key on his own account (as usual), but then will proceed with other bots that **are after him**, and not **all of them**.

For example, let's say we have bots 1, 2 and 3. If we sent 3 keys to bot 2, previously all 3 bots would redeem keys in order 2 -> 1 -> 3. That's not the case anymore, as bot 2 will forward key only to bot 3 and entirely skip bot 1 which is behind him, so it will be 2 -> 3.

Thanks to that, it's now possible to resume forwarding/distributing keys from the bot that received them last without risking `OnCooldown` on bots that we're sure they got all the keys already.

After a little over 3 months since last V2.0 release, there is another major ASF version ready - 2.1, which contains some crucial changes.

Before updating, I strongly recommend to **create a backup** of your ASF. While everything should work out of the box (as usual), this release contains **breaking change** that will modify existing structure and break backwards compatibility. It's always a good idea to prepare for that by making a backup, just in case something goes wrong.

### ASF 2FA rewrite

When ASF 2FA was firstly introduced, the whole 2FA concept was rather new and older users of ASF can still remember that not everything worked right away. Now the time has come to end old ASF 2FA ""v1"" and introduce new ASF 2FA ""v2"". The major difference between those two versions is the fact that old ASF 2FA was purely based on SteamAuth module written by developers of SteamDesktopAuthenticator. It works quite decent, but has it's own limitations such as not being SteamParental-friendly, running into unhandled steam issues and having rather poor ""ASAP"" implementation that comes from nearly half a year back when we all needed something that works.

Unfortunately it seems that developers more or less abandoned the library, therefore I decided to drop it and write my own ASF-integrated 2FA module that includes the same functionality, done in much better, faster, smarter and error-aware optimized way. While previous library was more ""universal"" and worked with nearly all 2FA features, current one is ASF-centered and provides the functionality that ASF needs, rather than being general-purpose for SDA or WinAuth programs. It's still in somehow beta stage, but it already works much better than the old implementation, and will benefit ASF in long-run.

Some important changes include:
- [!] Incompatibility with previous versions of ASF - Bot's database will be converted from old V1 into new V2 format, which means that newly generated Bot's database will not run correctly with previous versions of ASF.
- [!] Removed support for linking new authenticator and delinking existing ones, effectively removing `UseAsfAsMobileAuthenticator` Bot config property and `!2faoff` command.
- Added support for SteamParental in 2FA sessions. New ASF 2FA uses existing ASF mechanism of `SteamParentalPIN` to unlock and operate on such accounts, no action is needed.
- Improved security of ASF 2FA - 2FA module will now only accept confirmations ASF directly creates, and not all of them. `!2faok` command is not affected and still accepts everything.
- Many internal optimizations, bugfixes, improvements and general code review of ASF 2FA.

Point 2 is most important - until now ASF 2FA could potentially work in ""solo"" mode, called ASF 2FA (only) which was possible to achieve with `UseAsfAsMobileAuthenticator` and linking new authenticator. That mode is no longer available, and you're expected to link your authenticator firstly in either SDA or WinAuth. This is a security measure followed by the fact that ASF 2FA is a module designed for ASF, and not general-purpose authenticator. Every already linked authenticator will remain active and work properly, but if you used ASF 2FA ""solo"" mode, you're strongly encouraged to re-add your authenticator to SDA or WinAuth and keep a copy there, in addition to using it in ASF 2FA. You can do that by making a copy of `Bot.db` from ASF V2.0, extracting data of `_SteamGuardAccount` and importing it to SDA. Starting from ASF V2.1 and new ""v2"" format, this will no longer be possible as internal structure is being stripped down from majority of authenticator-related information.

This is more convenient for both you as an user, and me as a developer, because ASF instead of implementing extra unneeded features can focus on remaining compatible with SDA and WinAuth, working with their data and ensuring that you have a backup plan in case something goes wrong.

### .NET 4.6.1

Until now ASF was targetting .NET 4.5.1 framework, this was mainly because latest stable Mono version was 4.2 and it didn't support any more recent framework version. Things have changed, as Mono devs recently released version 4.4, which supports latest .NET framework 4.6.1, therefore ASF from now on uses this version as both compile environment and runtime.

Majority of users should be unaffected. Make sure you're using **[latest .NET](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981)** on Windows, and **[latest Mono](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Mono)** (4.4+) with other OSes.

Latest .NET framework ensures that ASF apart from using recently added features, can operate in better environment, which should improve things such as performance or memory usage.

---

Apart from major changes above, usual changelog:
- [!] Fixed a Steam issue that could lead to ASF not detecting that all cards were dropped already.
- ASF will now state current status of card drops (aka ""X card drops remaining"") when farming in solo mode.
- Massive portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

## ArchiSteamFarm V2.1

After a little over 3 months since last V2.0 release, there is another major ASF version ready - 2.1, which contains some crucial changes.

Before updating, I strongly recommend to **create a backup** of your ASF. While everything should work out of the box (as usual), this release contains **breaking change** that will modify existing structure and break backwards compatibility. It's always a good idea to prepare for that by making a backup, just in case something goes wrong.

### ASF 2FA rewrite

When ASF 2FA was firstly introduced, the whole 2FA concept was rather new and older users of ASF can still remember that not everything worked right away. Now the time has come to end old ASF 2FA ""v1"" and introduce new ASF 2FA ""v2"". The major difference between those two versions is the fact that old ASF 2FA was purely based on SteamAuth module written by developers of SteamDesktopAuthenticator. It works quite decent, but has it's own limitations such as not being SteamParental-friendly, running into unhandled steam issues and having rather poor ""ASAP"" implementation that comes from nearly half a year back when we all needed something that works.

Unfortunately it seems that developers more or less abandoned the library, therefore I decided to drop it and write my own ASF-integrated 2FA module that includes the same functionality, done in much better, faster, smarter and error-aware optimized way. While previous library was more ""universal"" and worked with nearly all 2FA features, current one is ASF-centered and provides the functionality that ASF needs, rather than being general-purpose for SDA or WinAuth programs. It's still in somehow beta stage, but it already works much better than the old implementation, and will benefit ASF in long-run.

Some important changes include:
- [!] Incompatibility with previous versions of ASF - Bot's database will be converted from old V1 into new V2 format, which means that newly generated Bot's database will not run correctly with previous versions of ASF.
- [!] Removed support for linking new authenticator and delinking existing ones, effectively removing `UseAsfAsMobileAuthenticator` Bot config property and `!2faoff` command.
- Added support for SteamParental in 2FA sessions. New ASF 2FA uses existing ASF mechanism of `SteamParentalPIN` to unlock and operate on such accounts, no action is needed.
- Improved security of ASF 2FA - 2FA module will now only accept confirmations ASF directly creates, and not all of them. `!2faok` command is not affected and still accepts everything.
- Many internal optimizations, bugfixes, improvements and general code review of ASF 2FA.

Point 2 is most important - until now ASF 2FA could potentially work in ""solo"" mode, called ASF 2FA (only) which was possible to achieve with `UseAsfAsMobileAuthenticator` and linking new authenticator. That mode is no longer available, and you're expected to link your authenticator firstly in either SDA or WinAuth. This is a security measure followed by the fact that ASF 2FA is a module designed for ASF, and not general-purpose authenticator. Every already linked authenticator will remain active and work properly, but if you used ASF 2FA ""solo"" mode, you're strongly encouraged to re-add your authenticator to SDA or WinAuth and keep a copy there, in addition to using it in ASF 2FA. You can do that by making a copy of `Bot.db` from ASF V2.0, extracting data of `_SteamGuardAccount` and importing it to SDA. Starting from ASF V2.1 and new ""v2"" format, this will no longer be possible as internal structure is being stripped down from majority of authenticator-related information.

This is more convenient for both you as an user, and me as a developer, because ASF instead of implementing extra unneeded features can focus on remaining compatible with SDA and WinAuth, working with their data and ensuring that you have a backup plan in case something goes wrong.

### .NET 4.6.1

Until now ASF was targetting .NET 4.5.1 framework, this was mainly because latest stable Mono version was 4.2 and it didn't support any more recent framework version. Things have changed, as Mono devs recently released version 4.4, which supports latest .NET framework 4.6.1, therefore ASF from now on uses this version as both compile environment and runtime.

Majority of users should be unaffected. Make sure you're using **[latest .NET](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981)** on Windows, and **[latest Mono](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Mono)** (4.4+) with other OSes.

Latest .NET framework ensures that ASF apart from using recently added features, can operate in better environment, which should improve things such as performance or memory usage.

---

STM change was introduced for two reasons.

Firstly, against my expectations, prices of foils can differ greatly, and ASF shouldn't decide for you if it's worth it to do a trade. Even though it's very likely that you **do** want to trade your dupe foil for a foil you don't have, the price difference can be significant and I'm not making trade bot but ASF.

Secondly, foil cards are quite rare, and even if you drop some, it's even more unlikely that you drop 2 or more foils of the same card, and even more unlikely that you'll find somebody on STM willing to trade them. Therefore, ASF help in this regard is already negligible, and I don't really think that it's required, especially when we consider foil prices from point above.

Therefore, ASF will no longer automatically accept foil swaps - but you can still accept those trades manually, same as emoticons or backgrounds.

When it comes to trade holds, I decided that summer/winter sale cards have short lifespan and majority of people (including me) do not want to see them being on trade hold - especially the 15 days one. That change applies only to those special cards though, and ASF will still keep working on liberal rules even for people with trade holds, as long as they ask for normal cards with long lifespan.

I strongly encourage to read **[Trading](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Trading)** wiki part that I've just finished writing - it contains a good explanation how STM module works in current form.

1) From the very first version of ASF, cards farming module worked the same way - it periodically checked every `FarmingDelay` minutes if game is fully farmed already, and moved to another game if that's true. It worked very well and reliable, but there was a room for future improvement. That improvement happened now, and cards farming module is now additionally powered by ASF events - ""new items"" event in particular. That approach allows ASF to check game badge page as soon as built-in ASF steam client notifies the process about card drop, which makes it possible to avoid wasting any extra second after the game is fully farmed. Previously we could waste up to `FarmingDelay` minutes waiting for the next check.

However, `FarmingDelay` config property and old approach was not removed, as it's still possible for Steam network to not inform us through an event about new item drop - be it because of an issue or similar. That's why we still periodically check game badge page, even though it should not be required with properly-working Steam network. We can make the checks rarer though, and rely on them only when Steam is talking crap (which sadly, happens too often).

Still, the improvement is significant, and that's another great ASF feature which will save up to 5 minutes per every title being farmed. The efficiency of farming is now at maximum, and I doubt that there is anything that could improve it further, but we will see :+1:.

1) From the very first version of ASF, cards farming module worked the same way - it periodically checked every `FarmingDelay` minutes if game is fully farmed already, and moved to another game if that's true. It worked very well and reliable, but there was a room for future improvement. That improvement happened now, and cards farming module is now additionally powered by ASF events - ""new items"" event in particular. That approach allows ASF to check game badge page as soon as built-in ASF steam client notifies the process about card drop, which makes it possible to avoid wasting any extra second after the game is fully farmed. Previously we could waste up to `FarmingDelay` minutes waiting for the next check.

However, `FarmingDelay` config property and old approach was not removed, as it's still possible for Steam network to not inform us through an event about new item drop - be it because of an issue or similar. That's why we still periodically check game badge page, even though it should not be required with properly-working Steam network. We can make the checks rarer though, and rely on them only when Steam is talking crap (which sadly, happens too often).

Still, the improvement is significant, and that's another great ASF feature which will save up to 5 minutes per every title being farmed. The efficiency of farming is now at maximum, and I doubt that there is anything that could improve it further, but we will see :+1:.

- Added `!version` command. Visit **[wiki](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)** for more info.

- Misc code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

---

`IsBotAccount` - `bool` type with default value of `false`. This property defines if account used for this bot instance should be considered a primary one (`false`), or bot/alt one (`true`). ASF tries to be as much compatible with both types as possible, therefore switching this option to `true` for alts is not technically required for ASF to work, but doing so will allow ASF to tune the logic better for alt accounts. At the moment, default value of `false` will tell ASF to ignore both invalid trades and friend requests not from `SteamMasterID`, as this is what we want for primary accounts. Switching this option to `true` will cause invalid trades and those friend requests to be rejected instead, which is better for alts. The logic might get extended in future releases, if needed. If you're not sure how to set this property, leave it with default value of `false`.

`!version` - Prints ASF version.

- ASF will now ignore initial `OnFarmingFinished()` event when `ShutdownOnFarmingFinished` is set, and you've just `!start`ed this bot instance, allowing you to issue commands without much hassle. Every next event (including the one fired after `IdleFarmingPeriod`) will be honored.
- `!update` command will now ignore (override) `AutoUpdates` setting, allowing you to force ASF update while still being able to skip automatic ones (on program startup and every 24 hours). 
- Fixed valid trades potentially being ignored in `SteamTradeMatcher` when user was overpaying with cards from the same game.
- Fixed wrong dupes calculation when Steam is talking crap and responding with NULL instanceID of items (thanks GabeN).
- Fixed ASF accidentally dismissing notifications related to profile comments.
- Massive portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
- [2.0.5.1] Fixed harmless error when account was not using `SteamApiKey`, introduced in 2.0.5.0.

[1] Previously we had rather half-blind mechanism of trying to play given games, expecting a disconnect, and reconnecting in `AccountPlayingDelay` minutes. Now instead we have proper event-based handling - ASF listens on each PlayingSessionState event and updates availability of farming accordingly, not only resuming farming immediately after it's possible, but also limiting number of reconnects and other issues which could be caused by previous approach.

Please note that new mechanism is in semi-beta state. It should work properly, but it wasn't carefully tested with all possible scenarios yet. If you spot anything weird, feel free to report with log file.

- Improved keys-detecting algorithm, which should greatly decrease amount of false-positives causing bot to redeem invalid cd-keys.
- Improved logic of `!loot`. ASF will now loot only trading cards (including foils) and boosters, instead of all steam community items (such as emoticons or backgrounds).
- When `SendOnFarmingFinished` is enabled, ASF will now also send trades when bot has nothing to farm.
- Code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

- Fixed rare problem related to removing old binary after auto update.
- [ConfigGenerator] Fixed config save not being triggered when editing collections (such as `GamesPlayedWhileIdle`).

It's almost half a year since first version of ASF was released. During that time I worked hard on bringing you the most advanced steam cards farming program that ever existed. At the beginning I didn't expect some things that happened recently, such as idle master being discontinued, Valve restricting steam market even further, or so many users being interested in tool that initially was supposed to work only for me. Therefore, I had to make some crucial changes that will benefit both me as a developer, ASF code-wise, and you - users, in long-run.

Good news are: nothing should break, everything should work out of the box, and the update process is still the same. Bad news are: You will need to read my wall of text to learn how new ASF works :+1:.

---

## Highlights:

### File structure has been changed
- ASF now has global config `ASF.json` and global database `ASF.db`. Global config allows you to configure how ASF behaves. Global database should not be edited - contains core global ASF persistent storage.
- ASF now uses new more modern and robust file structure for configured bots:
  Old: `Bot.xml`, `Bot.bin`, `Bot.key`, `Bot.auth`
  New: `Bot.json`, `Bot.bin`, `Bot.db`
- Removed deprecated now `SteamNickname`. Bot no longer changes nickname (same as `null` value).
- `Statistics` has been moved to global config.
- `Blacklist` has been moved to global config, and affects all bots now.

New file structure is well explained in **[Configuration](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)**.

Your existing (old) structure will be **automatically converted** into new format when ASF V2.0 is launched for the first time (with old configs). It is highly recommended to **make a backup** of your config directory prior to launching new ASF. Conversion should be transparent and not cause any issues, but conversion ""back"" is not possible. It's always a good idea to make a backup. **Also, please note that you still need to copy new `ASF.json` into your old `config` directory for conversion to be successful**.

---

### Auto-updates are implemented
- ASF now includes auto-updates, which can be configured in global config. Auto updates include not only the boolean switch of enabling and disabling, but also update channel which you want to track (Stable/Experimental). Updates are NOT mandatory, but highly recommended, as using up-to-date version guarantees bugless experience, latest features, stability enhancements and performance improvements.

Updates always consist only of `ASF.exe` binary. Configs or databases are never touched.

---

### ASF 2FA can now import and use classic 2FA
- Added support for SteamDesktopAuthenticator `.maFile`. If you put a `.maFile` in config directory, ASF will automatically pick it up and convert into it's own format. This is further explained in **[Escrow](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Escrow)** under ""2FA + ASF 2FA"".

### Other changes
- Added many new global and bot config properties. All of them are well explained in **[Configuration](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)**.
- Added Holiday Sale 2013 with appID of `267420` to the blacklist.
- ASF will now double-check if account is truly farmed after finishing it's queue, as new games might be added in the meantime.
- Fixed a rare exception which could happen when ASF tried to redeem a key on enabled but not connected bot instance.

### Bugfixes:
- [2.0.0.7] Fixed one more crash of ASF caused by bad configs
- [2.0.0.6] Fixed other misc bugs
- [2.0.0.6] Added `!farm`, `!farm <BOT>` and `!update` commands
- [2.0.0.5] Fixed a potential crash of ASF caused by bad configs

---

In any case, I highly recommend reading **[new wiki](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki)** as it explains how new ASF works.

- Removed deprecated now `SteamNickname`. Bot no longer changes nickname (same as `null` value).
- `Statistics` has been moved to global config.
- `Blacklist` has been moved to global config, and affects all bots now.

New file structure is well explained in **[Configuration](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)**.

Your existing (old) structure will be **automatically converted** into new format when ASF V2.0 is launched for the first time (with old configs). It is highly recommended to **make a backup** of your config directory prior to launching new ASF. Conversion should be transparent and not cause any issues, but conversion ""back"" is not possible. It's always a good idea to make a backup. **Also, please note that you still need to copy new `ASF.json` into your old `config` directory for conversion to be successful**.

---

### Auto-updates are implemented
- ASF now includes auto-updates, which can be configured in global config. Auto updates include not only the boolean switch of enabling and disabling, but also update channel which you want to track (Stable/Experimental). Updates are NOT mandatory, but highly recommended, as using up-to-date version guarantees bugless experience, latest features, stability enhancements and performance improvements.

Updates always consist only of `ASF.exe` binary. Configs or databases are never touched.

---

### ASF 2FA can now import and use classic 2FA
- Added support for SteamDesktopAuthenticator `.maFile`. If you put a `.maFile` in config directory, ASF will automatically pick it up and convert into it's own format. This is further explained in **[Escrow](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Escrow)** under ""2FA + ASF 2FA"".

### Other changes
- Added many new global and bot config properties. All of them are well explained in **[Configuration](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)**.
- Added Holiday Sale 2013 with appID of `267420` to the blacklist.
- ASF will now double-check if account is truly farmed after finishing it's queue, as new games might be added in the meantime.
- Fixed a rare exception which could happen when ASF tried to redeem a key on enabled but not connected bot instance.

### Bugfixes:
- [2.0.0.6] Fixed other misc bugs
- [2.0.0.6] Added `!farm`, `!farm <BOT>` and `!update` commands
- [2.0.0.5] Fixed a potential crash of ASF caused by bad configs

---

In any case, I highly recommend reading **[new wiki](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki)** as it explains how new ASF works.

It's almost half a year since first version of ASF was released. During that time I worked hard on bringing you the most advanced steam cards farming program that ever existed. At the beginning I didn't expect some things that happened recently, such as idle master being discontinued, Valve restricting steam market even further, or so many users being interested in tool that initially was supposed to work only for me. Therefore, I had to make some crucial changes that will benefit both me as a developer, ASF code-wise, and you - users, in long-run.

Good news are: nothing should break, everything should work out of the box, and the update process is still the same. Bad news are: You will need to read my wall of text to learn how new ASF works :+1:.

---

## Highlights:

### File structure has been changed
- ASF now has global config `ASF.json` and global database `ASF.db`. Global config allows you to configure how ASF behaves. Global database should not be edited - contains core global ASF persistent storage.
- ASF now uses new more modern and robust file structure for configured bots:
  Old: `Bot.xml`, `Bot.bin`, `Bot.key`, `Bot.auth`
  New: `Bot.json`, `Bot.bin`, `Bot.db`
- Removed deprecated now `SteamNickname`. Bot no longer changes nickname (same as `null` value).

- Added `CustomGamePlayedWhileIdle` bot config property, which is similar to above, but allows you to specify one custom game name instead, as in ""Playing non-steam game: XXX"". Default is `null` - no custom game being shown while idle.
- Added `AccountPlayingDelay` bot config property, which allows you to define how often bot should be checking if you finished playing already. Default is `5` minutes, old hardcoded value was `30` minutes.

- Removed deprecated now `SteamNickname` and `Blacklist` config properties. Bot no longer changes nickname (same as `null` value), and instead of per-bot Blacklist, built-in `GlobalBlacklist` is being used (which will be editable soon).
- ASF now automatically dismisses notifications related to dropped items. Thanks to that we can cut spam related to new items drop.
- Added `DismissInventoryNotifications` config property which controls above behaviour, default is `true`.
- Added `GamesPlayedWhileIdle` config property, which allows you to specify which game(s) should be farmed while ASF has nothing to do. Default is `0` - no games being farmed while idle.
- Fixed a rare exception which could happen when ASF tried to redeem a key on enabled but not connected bot instance.

- Added `!rejoinchat` command, which can be executed to issue `JoinChat` request on all connected bots.
- Enhanced `!addlicense` command, it now accepts more than one game, use `!addlicense 1,2,3` and `!addlicense <BOT> 1,2,3`
- Until Mono 4.3 stabilizes, ASF is compiled with (and requires) .NET 4.5.1 (again), previously - .NET 4.6.1.
- Improved `SendOnFarmingFinished`, now ASF will send trade only if it in fact farmed something and not always.
- Increased farming check interval from 15 minutes to 60, this should minimize the side effect of refreshing sessionIDs and annoying users with primary accounts.
- Fixed ASF failing to `!loot` the inventory with non-tradable steam items, thanks to @il-marc
- Fixed rare issue when bot would not try to reconnect in some unusual disconnect scenarios
- Fixed main RequestLimiter time being too short for over 100 enabled bots in ASF, some of them could not connect right away.
- Many other bugfixes, improvements and code optimizations. ASF should be also a little less memory intensive now.

- [!] Added general implementation of Bot->Master trades, thanks to @Ryzhehvost
- Added 3 new config properties related to Bot->Master trades: `SendOnFarmingFinished`, `SteamTradeToken` and `SendTradePeriod`. As usual, check out `example.xml` to learn more.
- [!] Added new commands: `!loot` and `!loot <BOT>`, which causes bot to send trade offer to `SteamMasterID` with all farmed items. Read more in **[Commands](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**.
- Added manual farming mode. That mode can be used both for farming specific game you want, or for increasing hours played. To activate manual farming, use `!play <appID>` or `!play <bot> <appID>`. To return back to automatic farming, issue above command with `0` appID. Read more in **[Commands](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**.
- Added a way to enable free licenses (games). Use `!addlicense <appID>` or `!addlicense <bot> <appID>` commands. Read more in **[Commands](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**.
- Added new config property: `ForwardKeysToOtherBots` which defaults to `false`. When `true`, bot will forward already owned steam cd-keys to other bots. Read `example.xml` for more info.
- Greatly reduced time required to fetch all badge pages and check all game hours.
- Added new command: `!statusall`, which prints status of all enabled bots. Thanks to @Ryzhehvost
- ASF now logs unhandled exceptions (crashes) to log file, also with stacktraces.
- Weekly portion of ArchiBoT enhancements and bugfixes.
- It is now possible to send multiple cd-keys to the bot for activation. You can do so by putting each key in it's own line, e.g.

```
XXXXX-YYYYY-ZZZZZ
YYYYY-ZZZZZ-XXXXX
ZZZZZ-XXXXX-YYYYY

- Added Steam Winter Sale 2015, with ID of `425280` to the blacklist. This is not needed (yet), but most likely Valve will show winter sale with card drops (again). You may need to adjust your own configs, another option is to not define `Blacklist` property, like in new `minimal.xml` config, this way you always use up-to-date ASF defaults.
- Fixed issue with expired sessionID for main accounts (bot stuck on farming one game). Bot will now automatically reconnect if sessionID expired.
- Optimized the way of handling main accounts, ASF will now firstly check if farming is possible, instead of assuming it is (which results in wasted time on getting appIDs to farm in case of failing).
- Bot no longer rejects friend requests, group invites, and trades - it ignores them now.
- Internal improvements regarding ASF 2FA and ASF primary accounts integration.
- Misc improvements regarding Steam 2FA integration.

This release is mostly focused on bugfixes and enhancements.
- Fixed many issues with commands freezing, tasks being stuck and other inter-process threading issues. Hopefully ASF will now remain responsive regardless of what is going on.
- Implemented a steam-request limiter, which would hopefully help to minimize a chance of getting temporarily banned or captcha-required logins when you have many bots. Bots will now start and login to steam with small 5 seconds breaks.
- ASF will now refuse to load invalid config XMLs rather than crashing whole process.
- Added more useful comments to `example.xml`, regarding e.g. escaping special characters in password field.
- `!exit` command now exits whole ASF process, including all bots.
- Added 3 new commands `!start`, `!stop` and `!status`. You can now start and stop instances based on their identifiers. If you have e.g. `marc.xml` and `sora.xml`, you can tell `marc` bot to e.g. `!stop sora` to (temporarily) turn off `sora` bot and release it's account. Similar, you can later `!start sora` to turn it back on.
- Many other smaller bugfixes, improvements and enhancements to make ASF work better.

2050732,2015-10-31T06:32:08Z,2015-10-31T06:45:11Z,ArchiSteamFarm V0.5,"- [!] ArchiSteamFarm does not require regenerating configs anymore. In case of missing fields, default ones are used now (hooray!)
- Added new (requested) config property `ShutdownOnFarmingFinished`, which defaults to `false`. If you set above property to `true`, ASF will stop the bot from using an account as soon as everything gets farmed, which may be useful for some people.
- ASF will now automatically exit when no more bots are running. Connected with above, if you set all bots to automatically shutdown after farming is done, ASF itself will also shutdown after every bot finishes it's job.
- Added missing BaseGameRequired (24) RedeemKey() status, thanks to Nephrite
- ASF now comes in merged .exe form, which means that ZIP now contains only ASF.exe and example.xml config in config directory. In future versions I may implement auto-update thanks to that, and it's also easier for you to run it.
- Added 2 new commands, that can be sent to the online bot through steam chat. Both of them are accepted only from master:
  `!farm` - Restarts farming, in case it stops for some reason, or in bot receives new game and doesn't start farming automatically (e.g. through activating steam gift)
  `!exit` - Will shutdown given instance of the bot.
- New icon for ASF
- Many internal code cleanups and improvements to maximize performance, stability and limit resources usage.
