6498525,2017-05-25T22:38:07Z,2017-05-25T22:42:56Z,0.10.3,"### Changed

- We noticed that some distribution packages were not
  building OpenResty against a JITable PCRE library. This
  happened on Ubuntu and RHEL environments where OpenResty was
  built against the system's PCRE installation.
  We now compile OpenResty against a JITable PCRE source for
  those platforms, which should result in significant performance
  improvements in regex matching.
  [Mashape/kong-distributions #9](https://github.com/Mashape/kong-distributions/pull/9)
- TLS connections are now handled with a modern list of
  accepted ciphers, as per the Mozilla recommended TLS
  ciphers list.
  See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS.
  This behavior is configurable via the newly
  introduced configuration properties described in the
  below ""Added"" section.
- Plugins:
  - rate-limiting: Performance improvements when using the
    `cluster` policy. The number of round trips to the
    database has been limited to the number of configured
    limits.
    [#2488](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2488)

### Added

- New `ssl_cipher_suite` and `ssl_ciphers` configuration
  properties to configure the desired set of accepted ciphers,
  based on the Mozilla recommended TLS ciphers list.
  [#2555](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2555)
- New `proxy_ssl_certificate` and `proxy_ssl_certificate_key`
  configuration properties. These properties configure the
  Nginx directives bearing the same name, to set client
  certificates to Kong when connecting to your upstream services.
  [#2556](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2556)
- Proxy and Admin API access and error log paths are now
  configurable. Access logs can be entirely disabled if
  desired.
  [#2552](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2552)
- Plugins:
  - Logging plugins: The produced logs include a new `tries`
    field which contains, which includes the upstream
    connection successes and failures of the load-balancer.
    [#2429](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2429)
  - key-auth: Credentials can now be sent in the request body.
    [#2493](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2493)
  - cors: Origins can now be defined as regular expressions.
    [#2482](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2482)

### Fixed

- APIs matching: prioritize APIs with longer `uris` when said
  APIs also define `hosts` and/or `methods` as well. Thanks
  [@leonzz](https://github.com/leonzz) for the patch.
  [#2523](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2523)
- SSL connections to Cassandra can now properly verify the
  certificate in use (when `cassandra_ssl_verify` is enabled).
  [#2531](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2531)
- The DNS resolver no longer sends a A or AAAA DNS queries for SRV
  records. This should improve performance by avoiding unecessary
  lookups.
  [#2563](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2563) &
  [Mashape/lua-resty-dns-client #12](https://github.com/Mashape/lua-resty-dns-client/pull/12)
- Plugins
  - All authentication plugins don't throw an error anymore when
    invalid credentials are given and the `anonymous` user isn't
    configured.
    [#2508](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2508)
  - rate-limiting: Effectively use the desired Redis database when
    the `redis` policy is in use and the `config.redis_database`
    property is set.
    [#2481](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2481)
  - cors: The regression introduced in 0.10.1 regarding not
    sending the `*` wildcard when `conf.origin` was not specified
    has been fixed.
    [#2518](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2518)

6246100,2017-05-02T01:00:44Z,2017-05-02T01:07:21Z,0.10.2,"### Changed

- The Kong DNS resolver now honors the `MAXNS` setting (3) when parsing the
  nameservers specified in `resolv.conf`.
  [#2290](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/2290)
- Kong now matches incoming requests via the `$request_uri` property, instead
  of `$uri`, in order to better handle percent-encoded URIS. A more detailed
  explanation will be included in the below ""Fixed"" section.
  [#2377](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2377)
- Upstream calls do not unconditionally include a trailing `/` anymore. See the
  below ""Added"" section for more details.
  [#2315](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2315)
- Admin API:
  - The ""active targets"" endpoint now only return the most recent nonzero
    weight Targets, instead of all nonzero weight targets. This is to provide
    a better picture of the Targets currently in use by the Kong load balancer.
    [#2310](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2310)

### Added

- :fireworks: Plugins can implement a new `rewrite` handler to execute code in
  the Nginx rewrite phase. This phase is executed prior to matching a
  registered Kong API, and prior to any authentication plugin. As such, only
  global plugins (neither tied to an API or Consumer) will execute this phase.
  [#2354](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2354)
- Ability for the client to chose whether the upstream request (Kong <->
  upstream) should contain a trailing slash in its URI. Prior to this change,
  Kong 0.10 would unconditionally append a trailing slash to all upstream
  requests. The added functionality is described in
  [#2211](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/2211), and was implemented in
  [#2315](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2315).
- Ability to hide Kong-specific response headers. Two new configuration fields:
  `server_tokens` and `latency_tokens` will respectively toggle whether the
  `Server` and `X-Kong-*-Latency` headers should be sent to downstream clients.
  [#2259](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2259)
- New `cassandra_schema_consensus_timeout` configuration property, to allow for
  Kong to wait for the schema consensus of your Cassandra cluster during
  migrations.
  [#2326](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2326)
- Serf commands executed by a running Kong node are now logged in the Nginx
  error logs with a `DEBUG` level.
  [#2410](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2410)
- Ensure the required shared dictionaries are defined in the Nginx
  configuration. This will prevent custom Nginx templates from potentially
  resulting in a breaking upgrade for users.
  [#2466](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2466)
- Admin API:
  - Target Objects can now be deleted with their ID as well as their name. The
    endpoint becomes: `/upstreams/:name_or_id/targets/:target_or_id`.
    [#2304](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2304)
- Plugins:
  - :fireworks: **New Request termination plugin**. This plugin allows to
    temporarily disable an API and return a pre-configured response status and
    body to your client. Useful for use-cases such as maintenance mode for your
    upstream services. Thanks to [@pauldaustin](https://github.com/pauldaustin)
    for the contribution.
    [#2051](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2051)
  - Logging plugins: The produced logs include two new fields: a `consumer`
    field, which contains the properties of the authenticated Consumer
    (`id`, `custom_id`, and `username`), if any, and a `tries` field, which
    includes the upstream connection successes and failures of the load-
    balancer.
    [#2367](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2367)
    [#2429](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2429)
  - http-log: Now set an upstream HTTP basic access authentication header if
    the configured `conf.http_endpoint` parameter includes an authentication
    section. Thanks [@amir](https://github.com/amir) for the contribution.
    [#2432](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2432)
  - file-log: New `config.reopen` property to close and reopen the log file on
    every request, in order to effectively rotate the logs.
    [#2348](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2348)
  - jwt: Returns `401 Unauthorized` on invalid claims instead of the previous
    `403 Forbidden` status.
    [#2433](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2433)
  - key-auth: Allow setting API key header names with an underscore.
    [#2370](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2370)
  - cors: When `config.credentials = true`, we do not send an ACAO header with
    value `*`. The ACAO header value will be that of the request's `Origin: `
    header.
    [#2451](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2451)

### Fixed

- Upstream connections over TLS now set their Client Hello SNI field. The SNI
  value is taken from the upstream `Host` header value, and thus also depends
  on the `preserve_host` setting of your API. Thanks
  [@konrade](https://github.com/konrade) for the original patch.
  [#2225](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2225)
- Correctly match APIs with percent-encoded URIs in their `uris` property.
  Generally, this change also avoids normalizing (and thus, potentially
  altering) the request URI when trying to match an API's `uris` value. Instead
  of relying on the Nginx `$uri` variable, we now use `$request_uri`.
  [#2377](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2377)
- Handle a routing edge-case under some conditions with the `uris` matching
  rule of APIs that would falsely lead Kong into believing no API was matched
  for what would actually be a valid request.
  [#2343](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2343)
- If no API was configured with a `hosts` matching rule, then the
  `preserve_host` flag would never be honored.
  [#2344](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2344)
- CNAME records are now properly being cached by the DNS resolver. This results
  in a performance improvement over previous 0.10 versions.
  [#2303](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2303)
- When using Cassandra, some migrations would not be performed on the same
  coordinator as the one originally chosen. The same migrations would also
  require a response from other replicas in a cluster, but were not waiting
  for a schema consensus beforehand, causing indeterministic failures in the
  migrations, especially if the cluster's inter-nodes communication is slow.
  [#2326](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2326)
- The `cassandra_timeout` configuration property is now correctly taken into
  consideration by Kong.
  [#2326](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2326)
- Correctly trigger plugins configured on the anonymous Consumer for anonymous
  requests (from auth plugins with the new `config.anonymous` parameter).
  [#2424](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2424)
- When multiple auth plugins were configured with the recent `config.anonymous`
  parameter for ""OR"" authentication, such plugins would override each other's
  results and response headers, causing false negatives.
  [#2222](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2222)
- Ensure the `cassandra_contact_points` property does not contain any port
  information. Those should be specified in `cassandra_port`. Thanks
  [@Vermeille](https://github.com/Vermeille) for the contribution.
  [#2263](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2263)
- Prevent an upstream or legitimate internal error in the load balancing code
  from throwing a Lua-land error as well.
  [#2327](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2327)
- Allow backwards compatibility with custom Nginx configurations that still
  define the `resolver ${{DNS_RESOLVER}}` directive. Vales from the Kong
  `dns_resolver` property will be flattened to a string and appended to the
  directive.
  [#2386](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2386)
- Plugins:
  - hmac: Better handling of invalid base64-encoded signatures. Previously Kong
    would return an HTTP 500 error. We now properly return HTTP 403 Forbidden.
    [#2283](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2283)
- Admin API:
  - Detect conflicts between SNI Objects in the `/snis` and `/certificates`
    endpoint.
    [#2285](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2285)
  - The `/certificates` route used to not return the `total` and `data` JSON
    fields. We now send those fields back instead of a root list of certificate
    objects.
    [#2463](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2463)
  - Endpoints with path parameters like `/xxx_or_id` will now also yield the
    proper result if the `xxx` field is formatted as a UUID. Most notably, this
    fixes a problem for Consumers whose `username` is a UUID, that could not be
    found when requesting `/consumers/{username_as_uuid}`.
    [#2420](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2420)
  - The ""active targets"" endpoint does not require a trailing slash anymore.
    [#2307](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2307)
  - Upstream Objects can now be deleted properly when using Cassandra.
    [#2404](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2404)

- :warning: Serf has been downgraded to version 0.7 in our distributions,
  although versions up to 0.8.1 are still supported. This fixes a problem when
  automatically detecting the first non-loopback private IP address, which was
  defaulted to `127.0.0.1` in Kong 0.10.0. Greater versions of Serf can still
  be used, but the IP address needs to be manually specified in the
  `cluster_advertise` configuration property.
- Admin API:
  - Disable support for TLS/1.0.
    [#2212](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2212)

### Added

- Admin API:
  - Active targets can be pulled with `GET /upstreams/{name}/targets/active`.
    [#2230](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2230)
  - Provide a convenience endpoint to disable targets at:
    `DELETE /upstreams/{name}/targets/{target}`.
    Under the hood, this creates a new target with `weigth = 0` (the
    correct way of disabling targets, which used to cause confusion).
    [#2256](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2256)
- Plugins:
  - cors: Support for configuring multiple Origin domains.
    [#2203](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2203)

### Fixed

- Use an LRU cache for Lua-land entities caching to avoid exhausting the Lua
  VM memory in long-running instances.
  [#2246](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2246)
- Avoid potential deadlocks upon callback errors in the caching module for
  database entities.
  [#2197](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2197)
- Relax multipart MIME type parsing. A space is allowed in between values
  of the Content-Type header.
  [#2215](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2215)
- Admin API:
  - Better handling of non-supported HTTP methods on endpoints of the Admin
    API. In some cases this used to throw an internal error. Calling any
    endpoint with a non-supported HTTP method now always returns `405 Method
    Not Allowed` as expected.
    [#2213](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2213)
- CLI:
  - Better error handling when missing Serf executable.
    [#2218](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2218)

exciting new features that have been heavily requested for the last few months,
such as load balancing, Cassandra 3.0 compatibility, Websockets support,
internal DNS resolution (A and SRV records without Dnsmasq), and more flexible
matching capabilities for APIs routing.

On top of those new features, this release received a particular attention to
performance, and brings many improvements and refactors that should make it
perform significantly better than any previous version.

### Changed

- :warning: API Objects (as configured via the Admin API) do **not** support
  the `request_host` and `request_uri` fields anymore. The 0.10 migrations
  should upgrade your current API Objects, but make sure to read the new [0.10
  Proxy Guide](https://getkong.org/docs/0.10.x/proxy) to learn the new routing
  capabilities of Kong. On the good side, this means that Kong can now route
  incoming requests according to a combination of Host headers, URIs, and HTTP
  methods.
- :warning: Final slashes in `upstream_url` are no longer allowed.
  [#2115](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2115)
- :warning: The SSL plugin has been removed and dynamic SSL capabilities have
  been added to Kong core, and are configurable via new properties on the API
  entity. See the related PR for a detailed explanation of this change.
  [#1970](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1970)
- :warning: Drop the Dnsmasq dependency. We now internally resolve both A and
  SRV DNS records.
  [#1587](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1587)
- :warning: Dropping support for unsecure `TLS/1.0` and defaulting `Upgrade`
  responses to `TLS/1.2`.
  [#2119](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2119)
- Bump the compatible OpenResty version to `1.11.2.1` and `1.11.2.2`. Support
  for OpenResty `1.11.2.2` requires the `--without-luajit-lua52` compilation
  flag.
- Separate Admin API and Proxy error logs. Admin API logs are now written to
  `logs/admin_access.log`.
  [#1782](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1782)
- Auto-generates stronger SHA-256 with RSA encryption SSL certificates.
  [#2117](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2117)

### Added

- :fireworks: Support for Cassandra 3.x.
  [#1709](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1709)
- :fireworks: SRV records resolution.
  [#1587](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1587)
- :fireworks: Load balancing. When an A or SRV record resolves to multiple
  entries, Kong now rotates those upstream targets with a Round-Robin
  algorithm. This is a first step towards implementing more load balancing
  algorithms.
  Another way to specify multiple upstream targets is to use the newly
  introduced `/upstreams` and `/targets` entities of the Admin API.
  [#1587](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1587)
  [#1735](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1735)
- :fireworks: Multiple hosts and paths per API. Kong can now route incoming
  requests to your services based on a combination of Host headers, URIs and
  HTTP methods. See the related PR for a detailed explanation of the new
  properties and capabilities of the new router.
  [#1970](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1970)
- :fireworks: Maintain upstream connection pools which should greatly improve
  performance, especially for HTTPS upstream connections.  We now use HTTP/1.1
  for upstream connections as well as an nginx `upstream` block with a
  configurable`keepalive` directive, thanks to the new `nginx_keepalive`
  configuration property.
  [#1587](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1587)
  [#1827](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1827)
- :fireworks: Websockets support. Kong can now upgrade client connections to
  use the `ws` protocol when `Upgrade: websocket` is present.
  [#1827](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1827)
- Use an in-memory caching strategy for database entities in order to reduce
  CPU load during requests proxying.
  [#1688](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1688)
- Provide negative-caching for missed database entities. This should improve
  performance in some cases.
  [#1914](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1914)
- Support for serving the Admin API over SSL. This introduces new properties in
  the configuration file: `admin_listen_ssl`, `admin_ssl`, `admin_ssl_cert` and
  `admin_ssl_cert_key`.
  [#1706](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1706)
- Support for upstream connection timeouts. APIs now have 3 new fields:
  `upstream_connect_timeout`, `upstream_send_timeout`, `upstream_read_timeout`
  to specify, in milliseconds, a timeout value for requests between Kong and
  your APIs.
  [#2036](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2036)
- Support for clustering key rotation in the underlying Serf process:
  - new `cluster_keyring_file` property in the configuration file.
  - new `kong cluster keys ..` CLI commands that expose the underlying
    `serf keys ..` commands.
  [#2069](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2069)
- Support for `lua_socket_pool_size` property in configuration file.
  [#2109](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2109)
- Plugins:
  - :fireworks: **New AWS Lambda plugin**. Thanks Tim Erickson for his

    [#1777](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1777)
    [#1190](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1190)
  - Anonymous authentication for auth plugins. When such plugins receive the
    `config.anonymous=<consumer_id>` property, even non-authenticated requests
    will be proxied by Kong, with the traditional Consumer headers set to the
    designated anonymous consumer, but also with a `X-Anonymous-Consumer`
    header. Multiple auth plugins will work in a logical `OR` fashion.
    [#1666](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1666) and
    [#2035](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/2035)
  - request-transformer: Ability to change the HTTP method of the upstream
    request. [#1635](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1635)
  - jwt: Support for ES256 signatures.
    [#1920](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1920)
  - rate-limiting: Ability to select the Redis database to use via the new
    `config.redis_database` plugin property.
    [#1941](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1941)

3923025,2016-08-20T00:39:54Z,2016-08-20T02:34:14Z,0.9.0,"The main focus of this release is Kong's new CLI. With a simpler configuration file, new settings, environment variables support, new commands as well as a new interpreter, the new CLI gives more power and flexibility to Kong users and allow for an easier integration in your deployment workflow, as well as better testing for developers and plugins authors. Additionally, some new plugins and performance improvements are included as well as the regular bug fixes.

### Changed
- :warning: PostgreSQL is the new default datastore for Kong. If you were using Cassandra and you are upgrading, you need to explicitly set `cassandra` as your `database`.
- :warning: New CLI, with new commands and refined arguments. This new CLI uses the `resty-cli` interpreter (see [lua-resty-cli](https://github.com/openresty/resty-cli)) instead of LuaJIT. As a result, the `resty` executable must be available in your `$PATH` (resty-cli is shipped in the OpenResty bundle) as well as the `bin/kong` executable. Kong does not rely on Luarocks installing the `bin/kong` executable anymore. This change of behavior is taken care of if you are using one of the official Kong packages.
- :warning: Kong uses a new configuration file, with an easier syntax than the previous YAML file.
- New arguments for the CLI, such as verbose, debug and tracing flags. We also avoid requiring the configuration file as an argument to each command as per the previous CLI.
- Customization of the Nginx configuration can now be taken care of using two different approaches: with a custom Nginx configuration template and using `kong start --template <file>`, or by using `kong compile` to generate the Kong Nginx sub-configuration, and `include` it in a custom Nginx instance.
- Plugins:
  - Rate Limiting: the `continue_on_error` property is now called `fault_tolerant`.
  - Response Rate Limiting: the `continue_on_error` property is now called `fault_tolerant`.

### Added
- :fireworks: Support for overriding configuration settings with environment variables.
- :fireworks: Support for SSL connections between Kong and PostgreSQL. [#1425](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1425)
- :fireworks: Ability to apply plugins with more granularity: per-consumer, and global plugins are now possible. [#1403](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1403)
- New `kong check` command: validates a Kong configuration file.
- Better version check for third-party dependencies (OpenResty, Serf, dnsmasq). [#1307](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1307)
- Ability to configure the validation depth of database SSL certificates from the configuration file. [#1420](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1420)
- `request_host`: internationalized url support; utf-8 domain names through punycode support and paths through %-encoding. [#1300](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/1300)
- Implements caching locks when fetching database configuration (APIs, Plugins...) to avoid dog pile effect on cold nodes. [#1402](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1402)
- Plugins:
  - :fireworks: **New bot-detection plugin**: protect your APIs by detecting and rejecting common bots and crawlers. [#1413](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1413)
  - correlation-id: new ""tracker"" generator, identifying requests per worker and connection. [#1288](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1288)
  - request/response-transformer: ability to add strings including colon characters. [#1353](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1353)
  - rate-limiting: support for new rate-limiting policies (`cluster`, `local` and `redis`), and for a new `limit_by` property to force rate-limiting by `consumer`, `credential` or `ip`.
  - response-rate-limiting: support for new rate-limiting policies (`cluster`, `local` and `redis`), and for a new `limit_by` property to force rate-limiting by `consumer`, `credential` or `ip`.
  - galileo: performance improvements of ALF serialization. ALFs are not discarded when exceeding 20MBs anymore. [#1463](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/1463)
  - statsd: new `upstream_stream` latency metric. [#1466](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1466)
  - datadog: new `upstream_stream` latency metric and tagging support for each metric. [#1473](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1473)

### Removed
- We now use [lua-resty-jit-uuid](https://github.com/thibaultCha/lua-resty-jit-uuid) for UUID generation, which is a pure Lua implementation of [RFC 4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt). As a result, libuuid is not a dependency of Kong anymore.

### Fixed
- Sensitive configuration settings are not printed to stdout anymore. [#1256](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/1256)
- Fixed bug that caused nodes to remove themselves from the database when they attempted to join the cluster. [#1437](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1437)
- Plugins:
  - request-size-limiting: use proper constant for MB units while setting the size limit. [#1416](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1416)
  - OAuth2: security and config validation fixes. [#1409](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1409) [#1112](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1112)
  - request/response-transformer: better validation of fields provided without a value. [#1399](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1399)
  - JWT: handle some edge-cases that could result in HTTP 500 errors. [#1362](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/1362)

> **internal**
> - new test suite using resty-cli and removing the need to monkey-patch the `ngx` global.
> - custom assertions and new helper methods (`wait_until()`) to gracefully fail in case of timeout.
> - increase atomicity of the testing environment.
> - lighter testing instance, only running 1 worker and not using dnsmasq by default.

### Breaking changes
- Remove support for the long deprecated `/consumers/:consumer/keyauth/` and `/consumers/:consumer/basicauth/` routes (deprecated in `0.5.0`). The new routes (available since `0.5.0` too) use the real name of the plugin: `/consumers/:consumer/key-auth` and `/consumers/:consumer/basic-auth`.

Due to the NGINX security fixes (CVE-2016-0742, CVE-2016-0746, CVE-2016-0747), OpenResty was bumped to `1.9.7.3` which is not backwards compatible, and thus requires changes to be made to the `nginx` property of Kong's configuration file. See the [0.7 upgrade path](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#upgrade-to-07x) for instructions.

However by upgrading the underlying OpenResty version, source installations do not have to patch the NGINX core and use the old `ssl-cert-by-lua` branch of ngx_lua anymore. This will make source installations much easier.

### Added
- Support for OpenResty `1.9.7.*`. This includes NGINX security fixes (CVE-2016-0742, CVE-2016-0746, CVE-2016-0747). [#906](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/906)

    - New `config.async` option to asynchronously increment counters to reduce latency at the cost of slighly reducing the accuracy. [#912](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/912)
    - New `config.continue_on_error` option to keep proxying requests in case the datastore is unreachable. rate-limiting operations will be disabled until the datastore is responsive again. [#953](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/953)
- CLI
  - Perform a simple permission check on the NGINX working directory when starting, to prevent errors during execution. [#939](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/939)
- Send 50x errors with the appropriate format. [#927](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/927) [#970](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/970)

### Fixed
- Correctly set the Cassandra SSL certificate in the Nginx configuration while starting Kong. [#921](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/921)

 We would recommended to consult the suggested [0.6 upgrade path](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#upgrade-to-06x) for this release.
- [Serf](https://www.serfdom.io) is now a Kong dependency. It allows Kong nodes to communicate between each other opening the way to many features and improvements.
- The configuration file changed. Some properties were renamed, others were moved, and some are new. We would recommended checking out the new default configuration file.
- Drop the Lua 5.1 dependency which was only used by the CLI. The CLI now runs with LuaJIT, which is consistent with other Kong components (Luarocks and OpenResty) already relying on LuaJIT. Make sure the LuaJIT interpreter is included in your `$PATH`. [#799](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/799)
- `kong.pid` became `nginx.pid`

### Added

One of the biggest new features of this release is the cluster-awareness added to Kong in [#729](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/729), which deserves its own section:
- Each Kong node is now aware of belonging to a cluster through Serf. Nodes automatically join the specified cluster according to the configuration file's settings.
- The datastore cache is not invalidated by expiration time anymore, but following an invalidation strategy between the nodes of a same cluster, leading to improved performance.
- Admin API
  - Expose a `/cache` endpoint for retrieving elements stored in the in-memory cache of a node.
  - Expose a `/cluster` endpoint used to add/remove/list members of the cluster, and also used internally for data propagation.
- CLI
  - New `kong cluster` command for cluster management.
  - New `kong status` command for cluster healthcheck.

Other additions include:
- New Cassandra driver which makes Kong aware of the Cassandra cluster. Kong is now unaffected if one of your Cassandra nodes goes down as long as a replica is available on another node. Load balancing policies also improve the performance along with many other smaller improvements. [#803](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/803)
- Admin API
  - A new `total` field in API responses, that counts the total number of entities in the datastore. [#635](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/635)
- Configuration
  - Possibility to configure the keyspace replication strategy for Cassandra. It will be taken into account by the migrations when the configured keyspace does not already exist. [#350](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/350)
  - Dnsmasq is now optional. You can specify a custom DNS resolver address that Kong will use when resolving hostnames. This can be configured in `kong.yml`. [#625](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/625)
- Plugins
  - **New ""syslog"" plugin**: send logs to local sytem log. [#698](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/698)
  - **New ""loggly"" plugin**: send logs to Loggly over UDP. [#698](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/698)
  - **New ""datadog"" plugin**: send logs to Datadog server. [#758](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/758)
  - OAuth2
    - Add support for `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. [#650](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/650)
    - Expose a new `/oauth2_tokens` endpoint with the possibility to retrieve, update or delete OAuth 2.0 access tokens. [#729](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/729)
  - JWT:
    - Support for base64 encoded secrets. [#838](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/838) [#577](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/577)
    - Support to configure the claim in which the key is given into the token (not `iss` only anymore). [#838](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/838)
  - Request transformer
    - Support for more transformation options: `remove`, `replace`, `add`, `append` motivated by [#393](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/393). See [#824](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/824)
    - Support JSON body transformation. [#569](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/569)
  - Response transformer
    - Support for more transformation options: `remove`, `replace`, `add`, `append` motivated by [#393](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/393). See [#822](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/822)

### Changed
- As mentioned in the breaking changes section, a new configuration file format and validation. All properties are now documented and commented out with their default values. This allows for a lighter configuration file and more clarity as to what properties relate to. It also catches configuration mistakes. [#633](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/633)
- Replace the UUID generator library with a new implementation wrapping lib-uuid, fixing eventual conflicts happening in cases such as described in [#659](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/659). See [#695](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/695)
- Admin API
  - Increase the maximum body size to 10MB in order to handle configuration requests with heavy payloads. [#700](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/700)
  - Disable access logs for the `/status` endpoint.
  - The `/status` endpoint now includes `database` statistics, while the previous stats have been moved to a `server` response field. [#635](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/635)

### Fixed
- Behaviors described in [#603](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/603) related to the failure of Cassandra nodes thanks to the new driver. [#803](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/803)
- Latency headers are now properly included in responses sent to the client. [#708](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/708)
- `strip_request_path` does not add a trailing slash to the API's `upstream_url` anymore before proxying. [#675](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/675)
- Do not URL decode querystring before proxying the request to the upstream service. [#749](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/749)
- Handle cases when the request would be terminated prior to the Kong execution (that is, before ngx_lua reaches the `access_by_lua` context) in cases such as the use of a custom nginx module. [#594](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/594)
- Admin API
  - The PUT method now correctly updates boolean fields (such as `strip_request_path`). [#765](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/765)
  - The PUT method now correctly resets a plugin configuration. [#720](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/720)
  - PATCH correctly set previously unset fields. [#861](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/861)
  - In the responses, the `next` link is not being displayed anymore if there are no more entities to be returned. [#635](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/635)
  - Prevent the update of `created_at` fields. [#820](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/820)
  - Better `request_path` validation for APIs. ""/"" is not considered a valid path anymore. [#881](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/881)
- Plugins:
  - Galileo: ensure the `mimeType` value is always a string in ALFs. [#584](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/584)
  - JWT: allow to update JWT credentials using the PATCH method. It previously used to reply with `405 Method not allowed` because the PATCH method was not implemented. [#667](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/667)
  - Rate limiting: fix a warning when many periods are configured. [#681](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/681)
  - Basic Authentication: do not re-hash the password field when updating a credential. [#726](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/726)
  - File log: better permissions for on file creation for file-log plugin. [#877](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/877)
  - OAuth2
    - Implement correct responses when the OAuth2 challenges are refused. [#737](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/737)
    - Handle querystring on `/authorize` and `/token` URLs. [#687](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/667)
    - Handle punctuation in scopes on `/authorize` and `/token` endpoints. [#658](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/658)

### Breaking changes

Several breaking changes are introduced. You will have to slightly change your configuration file and a migration script will take care of updating your database cluster. **Please follow the instructions in [UPDATE.md](/UPDATE.md#update-to-kong-050) for an update without downtime**.
- Many plugins were renamed due to new naming conventions for consistency. [#480](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/480)
- In the configuration file, the Cassandra `hosts` property was renamed to `contact_points`. [#513](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/513)
- Properties belonging to APIs entities have been renamed for clarity. [#513](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/513)
  - `public_dns` -> `request_host`
  - `path` -> `request_path`
  - `strip_path` -> `strip_request_path`
  - `target_url` -> `upstream_url`
- `plugins_configurations` have been renamed to `plugins`, and their `value` property has been renamed to `config` to avoid confusions. [#513](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/513)
- The database schema has been updated to handle the separation of plugins outside of the core repository.
- The Key authentication and Basic authentication plugins routes have changed:

```
Old route                             New route
/consumers/:consumer/keyauth       -> /consumers/:consumer/key-auth
/consumers/:consumer/keyauth/:id   -> /consumers/:consumer/key-auth/:id
/consumers/:consumer/basicauth     -> /consumers/:consumer/basic-auth
/consumers/:consumer/basicauth/:id -> /consumers/:consumer/basic-auth/:id
```

The old routes are still maintained but will be removed in upcoming versions. Consider them **deprecated**.
- Admin API
  - The route to retrieve enabled plugins is now under `/plugins/enabled`.
  - The route to retrieve a plugin's configuration schema is now under `/plugins/schema/{plugin name}`.

#### Added
- Plugins
  - **New Response Rate Limiting plugin**: Give a usage quota to your users based on a parameter in your response. [#247](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/247)
  - **New ACL (Access Control) plugin**: Configure authorizations for your Consumers. [#225](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/225)
  - **New JWT (JSON Web Token) plugin**: Verify and authenticate JWTs. [#519](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/519)
  - **New HMAC signature plugin**: Verify and authenticate HMAC signed HTTP requests. [#549](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/549)
  - Plugins migrations. Each plugin can now have its own migration scripts if it needs to store data in your cluster. This is a step forward to improve Kong's pluggable architecture. [#443](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/443)
  - Basic Authentication: the password field is now sha1 encrypted. [#33](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/33)
  - Basic Authentication: now supports credentials in the `Proxy-Authorization` header. [#460](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/460)

#### Changed
- Basic Authentication and Key Authentication now require authentication parameters even when the `Expect: 100-continue` header is being sent. [#408](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/408)
- Key Auth plugin does not support passing the key in the request payload anymore. [#566](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/566)
- APIs' names cannot contain characters from the RFC 3986 reserved list. [#589](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/589)

#### Fixed
- Resolver
  - Making a request with a querystring will now correctly match an API's path. [#496](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/496)
- Admin API
  - Data associated to a given API/Consumer will correctly be deleted if related Consumer/API is deleted. [#107](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/107) [#438](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/438) [#504](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/504)
  - The `/api/{api_name_or_id}/plugins/{plugin_name_or_id}` changed to `/api/{api_name_or_id}/plugins/{plugin_id}` to avoid requesting the wrong plugin if two are configured for one API. [#482](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/482)
  - APIs created without a `name` but with a `request_path` will now have a name which defaults to the set `request_path`. [#547](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/547)

  - Oauth2: Saving `authenticated_userid` on Password Grant. [#476](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/pull/476)
  - Oauth2: Proper handling of the `/oauth2/authorize` and `/oauth2/token` endpoints in the OAuth 2.0 Plugin when an API with a `path` is being consumed using the `public_dns` instead. [#503](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/503)
  - OAuth2: Properly returning `X-Authenticated-UserId` in the `client_credentials` and `password` flows. [#535](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/535)
  - Response-Transformer: Properly handling JSON responses that have a charset specified in their `Content-Type` header.
