8029880,2017-10-28T15:45:12Z,2017-10-07T09:44:11Z,v1.9.7.x,"This release marks a major update of the validation stage, which is now decoupled from the target acquisition and installation stages of the program. This has made it possible to add support for DNS and TLS validation. 

## Validation plugins
After choosing a target you will now be presented with a second menu to choose your validation options. There are plenty to choose from, though not all of them will be available of every target. In unattended mode you can pick a validation plugin using the `--validation` switch. If not specified we stick to the default one (FileSystem).

| IIS | Creates a temporary binding in IIS, preferable in the site that's being validated, but in case of manual input it will create a temporary website specifically for the purpose of answering the TLS-SNI challenges. 	|

## IIS validation mode
A big pain for FileSystem validation is getting the IIS configuration right. Not all servers have the same modules installed and in most cases local web.config files are not allowed to change crucial settings which are required for the ACME server to access the validation file. This put us between a rock and a hard place: too much configuration in the default web.config and crash due to locked sections and missing modules, or too little configuration and force each new user to struggle with the known issues by themselves.

v1.9.7 offers a different solution. The new IIS validation mode goes directly to the IIS server manager and tells it to make exceptions for the website that you're using for validation. This means that we don't have to unlock sections that Microsoft locked by default (for good reason) and that we can use feature detection to prevent errors. Specifically, it changes the following settings for the `.well-known` folder.

- Remove all non-global modules
- Configure the httpHandlers in the right way (StaticFile)
- Enable anonymous authentication
- Disable the ""Require SSL"" setting
- Allow unlisted clients in the IP security section
- Disable UrlRewrite (if installed)

Other settings, such as `mimeType` and `authorization` are still done locally with the web.config, so you can also still customize or override settings if needed.

## Renewals
Users will no longer have to dig through the event viewer to figure out what's happening with your renewals. You can now get a summary of that information from the main menu, where the successes and failures can be summarized per certificate. 

LEWS uses this data itself to determine with a high degree of confidence which certificates it has previously created. This does not only prevent accidental removal of other certificates with similar friendly names, but allows us to search IIS for bindings which use the certificate outside of the original target. This allows you to link the certificate to a places such as the empty binding on the Default Web Site, yet still have it automatically renew when the time is there.

## Bug fixes and other small improvements
- #280 - Install the intermediate certificates, so that a full chain can be built up
- #290 - Consider all bindings which use the certificate, not just the first one
- #293 - Add check to test if .NET Framework 4.5 is installed
- #380 - Re-creating the scheduled task for a specific user requires them to re-enter the password...
- ...also do not crash when the password is incorrect, but simply prompt for a retry
- #420 - Convert private key to Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider for compatibility
- #429 - Option to choose on which port to create new HTTPS bindings by @jlafitte 
- #450 - Fix bug in determination of the .well-known path for the FTP plugin
- Use the latest version of ACMESharp, allowing us to...
- #488 - Switch to BouncyCastle from OpenSSL as the library to generate certificates
- Main menu option to run a specific renewal
- Don't (re)validate when the host has already validated 
- Don't ask ""Would you like to start again"" every time
- ...many more

This release doesn't contain many new features, but is an important first step towards a more modular and flexible client. Lots of code has been simplified and de-duplicated to separate the ""target-aquisition"" part of the plugin system from the other functions commonly performed by plugins (i.e. validation and installation). 

# New UX

The main functional change is the start of a new UX. The program will now present the user with brand-new menu that allows you to create a certificate, list scheduled renewals, run scheduled renewals (forced), or cancel (all) renewals. For many common use cases it won't be necessary to dive into the registry or figure out command line switches, making LEWS more simple, as it's name states it wants to be.

# Features and improvements
- Option to create a certificate for a specific IIS site(s) in unattended mode (#445) 
Example: `--plugin iissite --siteid 1` 
Example `--plugin iissites --siteid 1,2,3`
- Option to exclude specific hosts from a SAN certificate (#419)
Example: `--plugin iissite --siteid 1 --excludebindings exclude.me,exclude.me.too`

# Removed
- The `--san` switch has been removed because it's no longer needed in the new UX.

Fix #572 (exclude binding with uppercase characters)
Fix #573 (`--hidehttps` didn't play nice with target updates)  

## v1.9.6.2

Fix #584 (central ssl support broken)
Fix #581 (allow task to run in battery mode)

7514635,2017-09-13T04:10:18Z,2017-08-24T19:51:33Z,v1.9.5.x,"The following major changes have been made since the previous release.

- Support for reading international domain names from IIS (#425).
- For new installs, we will use system-wide instead of user-specific folders and registry locations, giving you more freedom to run the program from different (service) accounts, both interactively and as scheduled task. By default the scheduled task will be created to run under the SYSTEM account. However, if user-specific configuration data is detected during startup, it will be used, to maintain compatibility with pre-1.9.5 installs (#483). Read the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/Lone-Coder/letsencrypt-win-simple/wiki/Migration-to-v1.9.5) if you are upgrading and want to run as SYSTEM.
- During renewal of IIS bindings the hosts for the sites are re-scanned. New domain names are added to the list, missing ones get removed and if the site cannot be found at all, the whole renewal is cancelled (#433, #436).
- Allow some log messages with ""Information"" priority to get logged to the Event Viewer, to allow administrators to better monitor what is happening when the program runs unattended or as a scheduled task.
- Various bugfixes and small improvements and refactoring, see the [list](https://github.com/Lone-Coder/letsencrypt-win-simple/milestone/8).

- If renewal fails for any reason, LEWS will now keep retrying until it succeeds, instead of pretending that it worked. This was a very serious and annoying issue reported many times by different users (#510, #475, #474, #460, #458, #448, #446 etc.)
- New `--verbose` mode for debugging, allowing the default mode to become a lot less chatty. In general the user I/O has been optimized and made more consistent across different parts of the program.
- Default web.config changed to prevent common handler and mime type issues (#490)
- The intermittent ""specified logon session does not exist"" error should be fixed now (#371)
- If the webroot of an IIS website changes it is now updated during the renewal process (#499)
- It's now possible to renew manually created certificates using a script (#299).
- Update Json.Net to fix intermittent ""request payload did not parse as JSON"" error (#508)

Two important changes since beta7

- There was a --signeremail and an --emailadress option which both promised to do the same, but only the former actually worked. Now the former has been removed and only the latter works. So for unattended registration with ACME from now one use --emailadress.

- I removed the option --certoutpath. It serves the same function as the much older --centralsslstore, while the latter is implemented in a more flexible way (i.e. on a per-certificate basis instead of globally). There already was a way to set --certoutpath globally, which is through the program settings (letsencrypt.exe.config).
