### Bug fixes

* Some usability issues with the CLI utility.
* A missing resource in the bundle.
* Unhideable panes on new window after a panel is hidden, the window closes, and a new window is opened.
* New file not created when being opened.
* The preference window layout is broken if the font selector gets too large.
* MathJax CDN shut down in May 2017. Math support is now provided via CDNJS.

### Enhancements

* UI for CLI utility installation. This is super handy! Kudos to @niklasberglund.
* Piping to the CLI utility now creates a new document with the piped content.
* Do not select ext in save dialog if possible. This also makes the “hide extension” checkbox work.
* Suggest filename only when doc have no `fileURL` is set. This fixes a problem with the CLI utility if you provide a non-standard extension.
* Launching files from CLI does not always open a new document now. A new document is created only when necessary.
* Image caches are now less an issue in the preview. This is done by disabling WebCache’s caching via private API. See #746 and #747 for discussions about a more long-term solution to this.

### Misc

* Bumped various dependencies to fix upstream bugs. The build process is also improved by this so you can clone and build from source more easily.",https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr,605277,uranusjr,https://api.github.com/repos/MacDownApp/macdown/releases/6361781/assets,https://api.github.com/repos/MacDownApp/macdown/releases/6361781,master,https://api.github.com/repos/MacDownApp/macdown/tarball/v0.7,https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/releases/tag/v0.7,https://api.github.com/repos/MacDownApp/macdown/zipball/v0.7,v0.7,False,False

- Scripting support. You can now use AppleScript and JavaScript (JXA)
  to automate interaction with MacDown programmatically.

### Resolved bugs

  special characters.
- Fixed strange behaviours when toggling block syntaxes in a document
  caused by unintended integer overflow and underflow.

- MacDown now updates the document content when file is edited with
  an external application. This prevents you from accidentally saving
  an older version of the document.
- Convert lines to ordered list.
- The save dialog now always appends .md automatically when saving an
  untitled file. You can still change the extension if you want.
- The editor is now read-only when you hide it. Hotkeys still work
