        TabPanel // underlined TabPanel and selected/hovered TabItem
    }

    TabControlHelper.UnderlineBrush

- New underline types also for `AnimatedTabControl` and `AnimatedSingleRowTabControl` styles and for `MetroAnimatedTabControl` and `MetroAnimatedSingleRowTabControl` [#2905](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2905)
- Fix / improve `AnimatedSingleRowTabControl` styles

    + Change `Flyout` from `ContentControl` to `HeaderedContentControl` which has the correct properties for headers.
    + Enable `Border` for `Flyout`
- Use `GrayBrush7` and `WhiteBrush` for menu `Separator` instead fixed colors.
- Fix BindingExpression at `DropDownButton`. Don't set `ItemTemplate`to `ContentTemplate`, `ItemTemplateSelector` to `ContentTemplateSelector` and `ItemStringFormat` to `ContentStringFormat`. This breaks the whole usage of the content stuff and shows a BindingExpression path error. [#2883](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/issues/2883)

- Fix `SelectionChanged` event of `SplitButton` which fires now only once.
- Add `TransitionCompleted` event to `MetroContentControl` and `WindowTransitionCompleted` event to `MetroWindow` which will be fired after the loaded Storyboard is completed.

- Add new `DataGridHelper` with `EnableCellEditAssist` attached property which enabled direct editing for CheckBox and ComboBox cells. (default to false) Thx to [@ButchersBoy](https://github.com/ButchersBoy) (taken from [MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit))

- Icon scaling [#2667](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2667) (@thoemmi)
  - New property `IconScalingMode` to MetroWindow. It's forwarded to `MultiFrameImage.MultiFrameImageMode` to set the icon scaling.
    - `MultiFrameImageMode.ScaleDownLargerFrame`  
      It takes the smallest frame which from the icon which has equal or larger size as the window's icon template. The frame is scaled down it's larger.

  - `OverlayBrush` sets the brush used for the dialog overlay.
  - `OverlayOpacity` sets the opacity used for the dialog overlay (0 = disabled, 1 = full overlay).
- The `TextBox`'s with the styles `MetroButtonTextBox` and `SearchMetroTextBox` can now use the button also if `IsReadOnly=""True""` (only if the button command is set)
- New `AutoWatermark` attached property at `TextBoxHelper` [#2722](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2722) (@xxMUROxx) which is able to get the `DisplayAttribute` from the bound property in following cases:
  - Binding that is **supported**

- `Flyout` changes for better `Margin` usage
  - This changes affects only users who used the sample from the source which shows how to use the `FlyoutsControl` actual width and a `Margin` for the `Flyout`
  - It's now possible to work without the actual width and use only the `Margin` or `HorizontalContentAlignemnt` for Left/Right and `VerticalContentAnlignment` for Top/Bottom `Flyout`.
    - `Margin=""200 30 0 0""` and `Position=""Right""` Flyout with left an top Margin
    - `HorizontalContentAlignment=""Stretch""` and `Position=""Right""` Flyout which covers the whole window
- Changed style names (and changes, see [#2767](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/issues/2767)) for
  - Default `Button` (`ButtonBase`) -> `MahApps.Metro.Styles.MetroButton`
  - Default `ToggleButton` -> `MahApps.Metro.Styles.MetroToggleButton`
- Fixed `Expander` closing animation and make it possible to change both animations (expand and collapse). [#2769](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2769) (@   Alkalinee)
- Updated `TabControl` and `TabItem` style for VS [#2768](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2768)
  - Handle TabStripPlacement
  - Default close button action (no closing event yet)
- `TextBox` ContextMenu changes [#2772](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2772), [#2758](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2758) by @Deadpikle
  - If you want to use the default context menu items cut, copy and paste you must do nothing
  - If you want to use your own context menu items without the default items you must do this
  
  ``` xaml
  <TextBox Text=""Yeahh"">
      <TextBox.ContextMenu>
          <ContextMenu>
              <MenuItem Header=""This is only a Test-Item"" />
          </ContextMenu>
      </TextBox.ContextMenu>
  </TextBox>
  ```
  - If you want to use your own context menu items with the spell checker items then you must do this
  
  ``` xaml
  <TextBox Margin=""{StaticResource ControlMargin}""
          Controls:TextBoxHelper.IsSpellCheckContextMenuEnabled=""True""
          Text=""Enabled"">
      <TextBox.ContextMenu>
          <ContextMenu>
              <MenuItem Header=""This is only a Test-Item"" />
          </ContextMenu>
      </TextBox.ContextMenu>
  </TextBox>
  ```
  - If you want to use your own context menu items with the deafult items then you must do this
  
  ``` xaml
  <TextBox Controls:TextBoxHelper.ClearTextButton=""True""
          Controls:TextBoxHelper.UseFloatingWatermark=""True""
          Controls:TextBoxHelper.Watermark=""Watermark"">
      <TextBox.ContextMenu>
          <ContextMenu>
              <MenuItem Header=""Custom Item"" />
              <Separator />
              <MenuItem Style=""{DynamicResource MetroMenuItem}"" Command=""ApplicationCommands.Cut"" />
              <MenuItem Style=""{DynamicResource MetroMenuItem}"" Command=""ApplicationCommands.Copy"" />
              <MenuItem Style=""{DynamicResource MetroMenuItem}"" Command=""ApplicationCommands.Paste"" />
          </ContextMenu>
      </TextBox.ContextMenu>
  </TextBox>
  ```
- `CustomDialog` improvements [#2775](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2775)
  - New overloaded generic method `ShowMetroDialogAsync` to create and show custom dialogs (self created dialogs which are inherited from `CustomDialog`)
  
  ``` csharp
  // create and show a new custom dialog of the given type with the default dialog settings
  var customBaseMetroDialog = await this.ShowMetroDialogAsync<CustomBaseMetroDialog>();
  
  // create and show a new custom dialog of the given type with own settings
  var customBaseMetroDialog = await this.ShowMetroDialogAsync<CustomBaseMetroDialog>(this.metroDialogSettings);
  ```
  - Better handling for dialogs settings also with the already available `ShowMetroDialogAsync` method
  
  ``` csharp
  // create and show custom dialog with default settings
  await this.ShowMetroDialogAsync(new CustomBaseMetroDialog());
  
  // create and show custom dialog with own settings
  await this.ShowMetroDialogAsync(new CustomBaseMetroDialog(this.metroDialogSettings));
  // or
  await this.ShowMetroDialogAsync(new CustomBaseMetroDialog(this, this.metroDialogSettings));
  ```
  - It's now also possible to configure the dialog settings at the custom dialogs class itself.
  
  ``` csharp
  protected override MetroDialogSettings ConfigureSettings(MetroDialogSettings settings)
  {
      return new MyCustomDialogSettings();
  }
  ```
  - Here is the source for the given samples
  
  ``` xaml

This is the first stable release of MahApps.Metro.

We removed everything marked as obsolete and made some API changes, but from now on MahApps.Metro follows Semantic Versioning, at least API wise. Please note that minor visual changes can still occur if there's a need for them.

A migration guide for the breaking changes is available here: https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/blob/master/docs/v1.0-Migration-Guide.md

# Features
- Added a StatusBar and StatusBarItem style #1558

- Added the `ButtonHelper.PreserveTextCase` attached property to control the automatic upper and lower casing of certain buttons. #1622
- If an .ico file contains multiple icon sizes, `MetroWindow` now automatically selects the optimal icon size. #1242 #1628
- `ShowMetroDialogAsync` now accepts `MetroDialogSettings` as argument so custom dialogs derived from the `CustomDialog` class can have a fade-in and fade-out animation
- The `ToggleSwitch` control can now be dragged with the mouse to change the enabled state #1652 #1595
- The `CleanWindow`'s close button now has a red background when hovering with the mouse.

  The `DialogBody` property has effectively been replaced by the `Content` property. #1615
- All elements in the titlebar now use the `IdealForegroundBrush` for a better contrast to the accent color. #1611
- The text in dialog buttons isn't lowercase by default anymore.
- Eliminated the need to pass the owning `BaseMetroTabControl` to `MetroTabItem` #1624

We're nearly ready to release version 1.0 of MahApps.Metro, so this may be the last unstable release.

There are no known breaking changes in this release, but we had to deprecate some things, particularly around the titlebar overlay behavior.

Please note that everything that is know deprecated will be removed in the 1.0 release, so you should prepare your applications soon.

Since we're following semantic versioning, we promise to not break anything from version 1.0 to 2.0.

# Features

## MetroWindow now indicates whether it's active or not

The `MetroWindow` now has the `NonActiveWindowTitleBrush` property that sets the window brush for an inactive window.

See PR #1320

## Fine grained control over the titlebar element overlay behavior

The overlay behavior of the elements of the window titlebar can now be controlled individually.

There are is now an enum with four values:
- `Never`
- `OverlayFlyout`
- `OverlayHiddenTitleBar`
- `Always`

For more info, see PR #1427.

## Underlined TabControl

Added the attached property `ControlsHelper.IsUnderlined=""True""` for the `TabControl` control that adds an underline.

## Custom ScrollBar width and height

The default ScrollBar width and height can now be set manually.

See PR #1387for more infos.

## Direct FlatButton style

Previously you had to include the `FlatButton` resource dictionary to add a `FlatButton`.
Now you can just set it at style of a button.

## MetroWindow icon EdgeMode

It is now possible to set the `EdgeMode` of the window icon.

# Changes

The 0.13 release of MahApps.Metro marks a very important change in the `MetroWindow` infrastructure along with several other fixes and improvements.

We've also updated the [MahApps.Metro.Resources NuGet package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/MahApps.Metro.Resources/) with the [latest icons](http://modernuiicons.com/).

# Features

## Custom themes

MahApps.Metro now allows to define custom themes for the application. We've rewritten the `ThemeManager` for this (don't worry, your old code should still work, but most old methods are now marked as `Obsolete`)

To add a theme, use the new `AddAppTheme` theme method.

## Completely rewritten `BorderlessWindowBehavior`

The `BorderlessWindowBehavior` has been completely rewritten, to fix a number of issues that have accumulated over time.

For a complete list of fixes, see PR #1156

## Auto-closing flyouts

Flyouts now have an option to be automatically closed when the user clicks outside of the flyout.
We renamed the property `IsPinnable` (that had no use) to `IsPinned` for this. 
`IsPinned` is `true` by default and, if set to false, enables the auto-closing feature.

## RangeSlider

The `RangeSlider` control has been completely rewritten because it was unusably broken before.

See PR #1055 for more info.

## Titlebar enhancements
- The titlebar now supports vector icons
- Added `LeftWindowCommands`
  This means that the normal `WindowCommands` property is now obsolete and is called `RightWindowCommands`
- The minimize/maximize/close button can now be styled
- Added ShowWindowCommandsOnTop property for window buttons #1098 (thanks @100GPing100)

## Others
- Added properties to change the font size of a tile #864 #1013
- Added support for `ToggleButton`s in the window commands #954
- Replace existing `RangeSlider` by new `RangeSlider` - #885 - see PR #920 / #1055

This is a bugfix release. It will most likely be the only bugfix release till v0.13.

# Fixes
- Fixed various bugs with the themed Flyouts (#947 #949): 
  - A dark `Flyout` doesn't have dark window commands anymore

- Flyouts respect the template margin #867 #974
- Fixed an `OverflowException` in the `CleanWindowStyle` #897 # 903
- Fixed various bugs for the `NumericUpDown` control: #952 #953
  - Fix for NumericUpDown exception raised when trying to enter a number in scientific notation
  - Fixed a problem with too early speedup
- Improved the performance for theme changes, they should now work instantly.
- Fixed an issue with the `WindowCommands` of a `CleanWindow`, they were white and therefore invisible when a `BorderlessWindowBehavior` was attached.

After only 2 months and nearly 300 commits, this is one of the feature-richest releases we've ever done.

This release, again, contains some breaking changes. 
We try to break things now rather than later, when we release version 1.0 (which is hopefully soon).

A quick overview:
- `ProgressIndicator` is now removed, as it wasn't working as expected. 
  Use `MetroProgressBar` with `IsIndeterminate = True` instead, which should give a much smoother experience.
- Like `ProgressIndicator`, `MetroImage` has been removed because it was broken. 
  A better alternative is to use a simple `Rectangle`, as described [here](http://mahapps.com/MahApps.Metro/guides/icons-and-resources.html)
- For the same reasons, the `Panorama` control has been removed. 
  While we have no drop-in replacement for this control, if you really want it back, 
  you can always submit a pull request with a better Panorama, but beware, it most likely needs a serious rewrite.

Upcoming changes:
- The `RangeSlider` control is currently being rewritten, so expect some breaking changes here.

# Features

## Dialog system

The dialog system has been overhauled for better extensibility.

The `SimpleDialog` class now allows to create a custom dialog.

`ProgressDialog` is a dialog that displays progress (duh!) inspired by Github for Windows.
`InputDialog` works like the `MessageDialog` but allows the user to input text.

For reference, see PR #785 , #860 and #901 .

## Modal Flyouts

Just like modal dialogs, Flyouts can now be made modal by setting the `IsModal = true`.
Thanks @grokys for this feature!

For reference, see PR #824

## Themed Flyouts

A Flyout can now have a theme, just like `MetroWindow`

There are four different theme states, indicated by the `FlyoutTheme` enum:
- `FlyoutTheme.Adapt`: The flyout will use the theme if the host window
- `FlyoutTheme.Inverse`: The flyout will use the inverse theme of the host window
- `FlyoutTheme.Dark`: Always dark. This is the default value
- `FlyoutTheme.Light`: Always use the light theme
- `FlyoutTheme.Accent`: Instead of the dark/light theme, use the accent of the host window

This behavior can be set through the `Theme` property

For reference, see PR #941

## Expander

Added new `Expander` control that can can be used to close/open for example a `GroupBox`
Thanks @Icehunter for this feature!

For reference, see PR #834

## NumericUpDown

Implemented a `NumericUpDown` control, inspired by the [Callisto](https://github.com/timheuer/callisto/wiki/NumericUpDown) style.
Thanks @xxMUROxx for this feature!

## New icons

Two new icons have been added to Mahapps.Metro.Resources:
- appbar_more_horizontal
- appbar_more_vertical

For reference, see PR #887

## MetroNavigationWindow

Implemented a `MetroNavigationWindow`. This is the re-implementation of [System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.aspx) in a Metro-style

For reference, see PR #801

## ContentTemplateSelector support for `TransitioningContentControl`.

You can now provide a `ContentTemplateSelector` for the `TransitioningContentControl`.

## Added AccentedSquareButton and IdealForegroundColor key
- Added an AccentedSquareButton. It looks like the SquareButton except that its Background is the current Accent.
- Added an IdealForegroundColor key to every accent.

# Changes
- Removed title parameter from `ShowMetroDialogAsync`
  #842

For reference, see PR #846

# Fixes
- Fixed high GPU usage when the `MetroProgressbar` is hidden. #812 #817
- Fixed the window glow not hiding when the window is hidden #839 #843
- Fixed window not being able to have a greater width than the width of the main screen #874 #917
- Fixed `ShowWindowCommandsOnTop=""False""` not working for `CleanWindowStyle` #894 #896
- Fixed using GlowBrush property enables the resizing of the window #851 #896
- Fixed the ToggleSwitch's built-in Top/Left margin #878 #880
- Fixed ThemeManager's OnThemeChanged work-around conflicting with other WPF internals #923 #932

**Warning**: This release has a few breaking changes. 
A quick overview:
- 'Colours' -> 'Colors'
  For consistency, we've chosen to rename all occurendes of 'Colours' to 'Colors'
- The 'TransitioningContentControl' use now an enumeration for 'Transition'

More details here: https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/wiki/Breaking-Changes-or-WTF-is-happening-with-the-ALPHA-version

Other things:
- You can now put all the resource dictionaries in your 'App.xaml' file
- ProgressIndicator is marked as 'Obsolete'. In future, use 'MetroProgressbar' with 'Indeterminate' set to 'true'
- Like the ProgressIndicator, the Panorama will be removed in future versions. 
  There is a chance that it will be rewritten and reintroduced later on.
- TextBox, PasswordBox, ComboBox and DatePicker use now the Validation.ErrorTemplate for displaying errors. 
  The default template is ValidationErrorTemplate.
- The Demo application has been completely rewritten.
