7932683,2017-09-28T20:22:11Z,2017-09-28T20:31:06Z,Release 0.13.0,"The latest release of Glide brings continued support.

## Consider switching to [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)

Glide is used by a great number of projects and will continue to get support for some time. But, the near future is likely in dep. dep can handle importing Glide config files. Please consider trying dep on your project or converting to dep. If you encounter an issue please check if there is an existing bug report and file one if there is not.

Glide will continue to be supported for some time as there are many users who rely on it and some are not able or ready to move to dep.

2270172,2015-12-11T02:04:09Z,2015-12-11T02:16:15Z,Release 0.8.0,"The 0.8.0 release of Glide brings with it some new major features. The most important of these is the `glide.lock` file, generated when running `glide update`. The `glide.lock` file contains the complete dependency tree and the commit id each package is pinned with. Where the `glide.yaml` file contains the dependencies of a project the `glide.lock` file, which is generated automatically, contains all the dependencies.

Instead of using `glide update` (or `glide up`) to install dependencies you should use the `glide install` command. This will install the dependencies and versions listed in the `glide.lock` file. This command is quite fast as it doesn't need to determine the dependency tree and does some actions concurrently to speed up performance. `glide up` should be used to update the pinned versions. When no `glide.lock` file is present the `glide install` command will perform an update.

We recommend you check the `glide.lock` file into your version control system.

In addition to locking by default, Glide 0.8.0 detects dependencies in dependencies not managed by a package manager (Glide, GPM, Godep, GB) and properly pins them.

This is a major step forward for Glide as you can now easily have reproducible builds while maintaining semantic version range support and usage.
- Issues #156 and #85: Added lockfile support (glide.lock). This file records
  commit id pinned versions of the entire dependency tree. The `glide install`
  command installs the pinned dependencies from the `glide.lock` file while
  `glide update` updates the tree and lockfile. Most people should use `glide
  install` unless they want to intentionally updated the pinned dependencies.
  `glide install` is able to use concurrency to more quickly install update.
- Issues #33 and #159: Glide notifies if a dependency checkout has uncomitted
  changes.
- Issue #146: Glide scans projects not managed by a dependency manager, fetches
  their dependencies, and pins them in the glide.lock file.
- Issue #99: Glide `get` pins dependencies by default and allows a version to
  be passed in. For example, `glide get github.com/Masterminds/convert#^1.0.0`
  will fetch `github.com/Masterminds/convert` with a version of `^1.0.0`.
- Issue #155: Copying packages from the `GOPATH` is now opt-in.
- Removed the pin command as it's not longer needed now that there are lockfiles.
