- Updated IRecognizerActionResult.matched and IIntentRecognizerResult.matched to return all the matched results as an array versus just the text that matched. These changes shouldn't effect many people as its likely you were already re-evaluating the matched expression if you needed the capture data.
- Added a new RecognizeMode for IntentDialogs which solves in issue where launching an IntentDialog as a sub dialog would cause it to immediately process the last utterance. This should only be a breaking change if you are using multiple IntentDialogs to scope down from a general model to a more specialized model.  In that case you'll want to create your specialized IntentDialogs with a `recognizeMode: builder.RecognizeMode.onBegin`.

- Renamed IFormBuilder.OnCompletionAsync to OnCompletion since the method itself is not async.
- JSON FormFlow has changed substantially.  (See New Features)
- Missing resources cuases an error to be thrown. 

## New Features
- JSON FormFlow now allows completely specifying everything through the JSON Schema file:
  1. There is a completely seperate builder, FormBuilderJson which takes the schema.
  2. JSON Schema now supports message, confirmation, validation with regex and dynamically compiled code.
  3. You no longer need to specify the schema on every field.
  4. It is packaged as a seperate dll Microsoft.Bot.Builder.FormFlow.Json which depends on Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting which brings in lots of dependencies.
- LuisDialog supports multiple LuisModel and ILuisService instances.
- New attribute PatternAttribute for field validation via regex.
- IBotDataStore now allows supplying your own storage implementation.
- We continue to update the documentation. :-) 

## Bug Fixes

- Target framework is now .Net 4.6.  This change was necessary to reliably support using the thread culture for localization.
- FormFlow ValidateAsyncDelegate now needs to return the value to set in the field.  This was in order to support programmatic value transformations.
- The signature of Conversation.Resume has changed in order to support a resumption cookie to maintain conversation state across dialog resumption.
- Moved to the latest Nuget packages including for the Bot Framework Connector.

## New Features
- System dialogs and FormFlow will now generate buttons for channels that support them. 
- FormFlow can now be driven by an extended JSON Schema that allows doing attributes in a similar way to C#.  This allows forms to be generated at run-time from data rather than C# reflection.
- System dialogs and FormFlow are localized to nine languages.  (Contributions for more languages would be welcome.) We also provide tools to help generate the resource files required to localize your FormFlow state classes.
- DateTime parsing in English now uses Chronic which supports more natural Date/Time expressions like ""tomorrow at 4"".
- The LuisDialog now supports the full LUIS schema including actions.

## Bugs
- Fixed lots of bugs as reported by developers--thanks!

- Rename some delegates and methods to be more consistent and to support dynamic field definition. Unless you were using Field or FieldReflector directly this should be transparent.

None of these changes are likely to effect anyone but they could so here are the ones that may break things:
- Updated arguments passed to BotConnectorBot.listen().
- Renamed ISessionArgs to ISessionOptions and also renamed Session.args to Session.options.
- Made Session.createMessage() private. It doesn't need to be public now that we have new Message builder class.
- Changed EntityRecognizer.parseNumber() to return Number.NaN instead of undefined when a number isn't recognized.

## Other Changes
- Significant improvements to the Reference Docs.
- Fixed a couple of bugs related to missing intents coming back from LUIS. 
- Fixed a deep copy bug in MemoryStorage class. I now use JSON.stringify() & JSON.parse() to ensure a deep copy.
- Made dialogId passed to Session.reset() optional.
- Updated Message.setText() to support passing an array of prompts that will be chosen at random.
- Added methods to Message class to simplify building complex multi-part and randomized prompts.
- BotConnectorBot changes needed to support continueDialog() method that's in development.
- Fixed a typo in the import of Consts.ts for Mac builds.
- Updated LKG build and package.json version.
