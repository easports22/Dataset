In this release:
- Visual Studio Team Services Personal Access Token limited duration set via configuration.

Bug Fixes
- Fixes an issue with Bitbucket Authentication where the client could refuse to authenticate with the service.
- Fixes an issue with Bitbucket Authentication where the client could cause a stack overflow exception.
- Fixes an issue with reading yes/no values from Git's system configuration.

To install the Git Credential Manager, download and double-click the `GCMW-1.12.0.exe` installer. It is that easy, it will even install [Git for Windows 2.13.3)](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) and the [Microsoft .Net Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w0x726c2%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) for you if necessary.

For non-installation or custom installation needs, download the `gcmw-v1.12.0.zip` archive and expand its contents. Use the included `install.cmd` or options provided via `git-credential-manager install` to complete setup.

Bug Fixes

- Added support for environment variables to be use to control configuration and behavior.
- Added the ability to ignore system and/or local configuration settings via an environmental variable.
- Added the ability to enable tracing to console or a file via environmental variable.
  - This means tracing can now being before configuration is read giving a more useful information when diagnosing issues.
- Tracing now matches Git's format and can be safely and meaningfully interleaved with `GIT_TRACE` into a file or onto the console.
- New documentation model has been adopted. Instead of putting all content into [README.md](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/blob/master/README.md), the content is now spread out between the README file and the [Docs/](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/tree/master/Docs) folder.
- New help documents for GCM and Askpass are shipped as HTML with the installer. This means the GCM's help can now be reached via `git help credential-manager` and `git credential-manager --help`.
  - Includes a new [build-docs.cmd](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/blob/master/Cli-CredentialHelper/build-docs.cmd) build script which safely depends on [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org).
- Removed dependency on the deprecated [VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/) static Identity Service and now, correctly, route through VSTS Location Service to acquire the correct URI for the Identity Service.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where SourceTree would insert duplicate environmental variables and the GCM would fail to handle the duplication gracefully.
- Fixed an issue where `%HOME%` was an unexpected directory causing the GCM to not find Git's global configuration file.
- Fixed an issue where Git's system and portable configuration files could not be read correctly.
