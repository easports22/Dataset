We're pleased to announce the release of Python Tools 2.2.6 for Visual Studio 2015.

Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) is an open-source plug-in for Visual Studio which supports programming with the Python language. It lets you bring your own Python interpreter, including CPython, IronPython, PyPy, and more, and supports a broad range of features from editing with IntelliSense to interactive debugging, profiling, interactive REPLs with support for IPython, cross-platform and cross-language debugging support, and deployment to [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com).

We also have a Sample Pack containing extra templates for Django, Flask and Bottle web sites, [PyKinect](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pykinect) for using Kinect for Windows, and [PyVot](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvot) for interacting with Excel. Our Machine Learning Pack contains some samples for the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library and Python code generation for [Azure Machine Learning](http://azureml.net/) web services.

## Requirements

PTVS 2.2.6 requires [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs?wt.mc_id=github_microsoft_ptvs) Community or higher, [Express for Desktop or Express for Web](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/mt238358?wt.mc_id=github_microsoft_ptvs). [Update 3](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs2015-update3-vs?wt.mc_id=github_microsoft_ptvs) is recommended.

You will also need to install one or more Python interpreters. See our [help page](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/wiki/Selecting-and-Installing-Python-Interpreters) for assistance choosing a version of Python if you do not already have one.

## Fixes for 2.2.6

PTVS 2.2.6 is a critical bug fix release, so no new functionality has been added.

The following significant issues have been resolved:
- Fixes errors when auto-configuring Python 3.6 (issues [#1565](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/1565), [#1994](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/1994) and [#2005](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/2005))
  - Note that Python 3.6 is still not supported by this release. This fix merely prevents a crash when unsupported versions are configured as custom environments.
- Fixes interpreter link crashing when path variable not set (issue [#2010](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/2010))

## Earlier Visual Studio Versions

PTVS 2.2.3 and later do not support Visual Studio 2013. If you are unable to obtain any of the editions of Visual Studio 2015, the last release of PTVS for Visual Studio 2013 was [PTVS 2.2.2](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/releases/tag/v2.2.2) and for Visual Studio 2010 and 2012 was [PTVS 2.1.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/releases/v2.1.1).

We're pleased to announce a release candidate for Python Tools 2.2.4 for Visual Studio.

Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) is an open-source plug-in for Visual Studio which supports programming with the Python language. It lets you bring your own Python interpreter, including CPython, IronPython, PyPy, and more, and supports a broad range of features from editing with IntelliSense to interactive debugging, profiling, interactive REPLs with support for IPython, cross-platform and cross-language debugging support, and deployment to [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com).

We also have a Sample Pack containing extra templates for Django, Flask and Bottle web sites, [PyKinect](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pykinect) for using Kinect for Windows, and [PyVot](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvot) for interacting with Excel. Our Machine Learning Pack contains some samples for the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library and Python code generation for [Azure Machine Learning](http://azureml.net/) web services.

We're pleased to announce the release of Python Tools 2.2.2 for Visual Studio.

Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) is an open-source plug-in for Visual Studio which supports programming with the Python language. It lets you bring your own Python interpreter, including CPython, IronPython, PyPy, and more, and supports a broad range of features from editing with IntelliSense to interactive debugging, profiling, interactive REPLs with support for IPython, cross-platform and cross-language debugging support, and deployment to [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com).

We also have a Sample Pack containing extra templates for Django, Flask and Bottle web sites, [PyKinect](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pykinect) for using Kinect for Windows, and [PyVot](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvot) for interacting with Excel. Our Machine Learning Pack contains some samples for the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library and Python code generation for [Azure Machine Learning](http://azureml.net/) web services.

## Requirements

PTVS 2.2.2 requires one of the following versions of Visual Studio:
- [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) Community or higher, [Express for Desktop or Express for Web](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/mt238358)
  - [Update 1](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-update1-vs) is recommended
- Visual Studio 2013 Community or higher, [Express for Desktop](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9832280) or [Express for Web](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9832232)

You will also need to install one or more Python interpreters. See our [help page](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/wiki/Selecting-and-Installing-Python-Interpreters) for assistance choosing a version of Python if you do not already have one.

## Improvements for 2.2.2

PTVS 2.2.2 is primarily a bug fix release, so no new functionality has been added. However, Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 includes improvements to Python interactive windows that require PTVS 2.2.2 to avoid compatibility issues.

The following significant issues have been resolved:
- Fixed incompatibilities with Visual Studio 2015 Update 1
- [#712](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/712) Don't add Unicode BOM by default
- [#664](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/663) Profiler does not handle UTF-8 BOM
- [#810](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/810) Referencing multiple extension modules does not work
- [#926](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/926) Cannot open file when coding comment does not match actual encoding

## Known Issues
- [#523](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/523) Invalid digital signature on VSIX in VS 2015
- [#597](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/597) Extract Method does not appear on the editor context menu
- [#1014](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/1014) Syntax highlighting in Django templates displays error

Your feedback and suggestions are much appreciated. To report issues or to review the complete list of known issues for this release, please visit our [issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues) page.

## Where was PTVS 2.2.1?

We had 2.2.1 all ready to release, but found some last minute bugs that needed fixing. However, we had already included the buggy version on the VS 2015 Update 1 ISO. Since it is too late to update that release, we've had to go to the next version.

These fixes are only in PTVS 2.2.2. If you installed [Visual Studio 2015 Update 1](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-update1-vs), you may see these issues until you install PTVS 2.2.2.
- [#976](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/976) IPython REPL will not start when startup script specified
- [#979](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/979) Crash opening mixed Python/C solution

The WFastCgi tool for hosting Python websites on servers running IIS can now be found on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wfastcgi).
