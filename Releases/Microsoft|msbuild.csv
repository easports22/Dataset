The only change to MSBuild since Update 3 RC was a fix for #705, which was an internal-only change not reflected in the GitHub source.

**Important**: the actual Update 3 release was not produced by compiling the GitHub source at this commit.  It was built from a mirror of MSBuild in the Microsoft-internal VS repository, which was manually synced to contain the changes made here.  These sources are instructive for behavior and understanding purposes, but not suitable for debugging the released binaries.
