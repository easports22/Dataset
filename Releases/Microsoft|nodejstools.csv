## Changes since 1.2 RC

This is a minor update that contains fixes for several issues identified in the [1.2 RC release](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/releases/tag/v1.2.RC). Specifically:
- Remove global npm node feature, which was unnecessary for most users and also causing performance issues
- #1140 Execute `typings install` separately for each package 
- Added better diagnostic information to help drive quality
  - #1116 Add better diagnostic info for ES6 Mode IntelliSense
  - #1096 Add Telemetry for Which IntelliSense Is Currently Selected

## Known Issues
- #125 Attach debugger to Azure deployment via Server Explorer fails. You can attach manually as outlined on the Advanced Debugging page.
- #434 Profiling does not resolve function names if using 64-bit Node. Install and profile 32-bit Node to work around this issue.
- ReSharper is known to cause code-completion, memory, and performance issues when enabled alongside NTVS. We recommend disabling at least ReSharper's JavaScript functionality if you are having problems.
- NTVS does not fully support build and test features of Visual Studio Team Services, but we are working to improve the experience. If you are having trouble, please file an issue so we can get to the bottom of it.
- We are constantly working to improve our code-completion and formatting to support the wide variety of modules and code styles. Please file an issue if you are running into unexpected behavior.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**RELEASE NOTES**
Node.js Tools for Visual Studio (NTVS) is a free, open-source plug-in that turns Visual Studio into a Node.js Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It supports a broad range of features including editing, IntelliSense, cross platform and remote debugging, edit and continue, npm integration, profiling, TypeScript, and an integrated REPL window. NTVS also includes a set of project templates that make it easy to quickly create and deploy websites to Microsoft Azure Websites or Cloud Services. 

NTVS 1.2 Beta is available for:
- Visual Studio Community 2015 (requires Update 2 or later)
- Visual Studio 2015 Express for Web (requires Update 2 or later)
- Visual Studio 2015 Professional or above (requires Update 2 or later)

Note that NTVS is **not available** for Visual Studio Express for Windows (or Windows Desktop)

## Changes since 1.2 Alpha

We expect this release of NTVS to provide a better user experience and general stability of the product.

Highlights include:

#### Faster, better ES6 IntelliSense!

Whether you were running into performance issues or craving the latest and greatest JavaScript goodness, the new ES6 IntelliSense experience is now on by default, and better than ever! The new ES6 IntelliSense experience takes advantage of type definition files to provide better and more performant IntelliSense for the most popular Node.js frameworks, such as Commander, Express, jQuery and Knockout.

Whenever you require a new npm package, the associated ""typings"" will be automatically downloaded to your project.

And so long as the typings are available, you'll be able to see the relevant completions next time you 'require' a module.

> **❗Known Issue**
> IntelliSense for locally required files does not currently work, and will be available in Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 RTM (tracked by #1076).
> 
> As a workaround, try adding a `tsconfig.json` to the root of your NTVS project with these options:
> 
> ``` json
> {
>   ""compilerOptions"": {
>     ""allowJs"": true,
>     ""moduleResolution"": ""node"",
>     ""noEmit"": true
>   },
>   ""exclude"": [""node_modules""]
> }
> ```
> 
> And [right click `Save As` this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/release-1.8/lib/typescriptServices.js) into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TypeScript` to replace the existing `typescriptServices.js` in that directory.

Love it? Hate it? Hungry? :hamburger: :ramen: :tropical_drink: Please, please, please [let us know what you think!](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/issues/1077) :candy: 

### More reliable debugging

Running into flaky or laggy debug experiences? You _**so**_ want to download this release. We've fixed many miscellaneous issues that should provide an overall better debugging experiences. We're committed to providing the best debugging experience possible, so please [let us know how we're doing!](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/issues/1077)

### Improved Unit Testing experiences

While it's generally best practice to avoid writing bugs altogether, some of us our not omniscient, and find unit tests to be pretty helpful. :wink: So we've made some improvements to the unit testing experience, including [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) support thanks to @jcansdale (#989).

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/762848/16211627/879abd00-36f7-11e6-9702-0c498eef5f5d.png)

This release also improves support other testing frameworks, including providing a custom [mocha](http://mochajs.org) path in ""mocha.json"".

``` json
{
    ""ui"": ""tdd"",
    ""timeout"": 300000,
    ""reporter"": ""xunit"",
    ""path"": ""optional path to where mocha is installed""
}
```

### `.npm` _everywhere_

We gave you `.npm commands` Node.js Interactive Window, and you told us that's just not enough... It must be _everywhere_. So now, thanks to #808, we'll finally be able to use npm everywhere, just as it should be.

### Significantly improved stability and performance

All across the product numerous issues have been fixed. We expect this release to provide both a much better user experience and improved stability.

## Known Issues
- #1076: IntelliSense For Locally Required Files needs VS 2015 Update 3 RTM+ 
- #928 `Error TS5055: Cannot Write file` error displayed in error pane when using ES6 Preview Intellisense. This does not effect building or running projects.
- #125 Attach debugger to Azure deployment via Server Explorer fails. You can attach manually as outlined on the Advanced Debugging page.
- #434 Profiling does not resolve function names if using 64-bit Node. Install and profile 32-bit Node to work around this issue.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**RELEASE NOTES**
Node.js Tools for Visual Studio (NTVS) is a free, open-source plug-in that turns Visual Studio into a Node.js Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It supports a broad range of features including editing, IntelliSense, cross platform and remote debugging, edit and continue, npm integration, profiling, TypeScript, and an integrated REPL window. NTVS also includes a set of project templates that make it easy to quickly create and deploy websites to Microsoft Azure Websites or Cloud Services. 

NTVS 1.2 Alpha is available for:
- Visual Studio ""15"" Preview
- Visual Studio Community 2015 (requires Update 2 or later)
- Visual Studio 2015 Express for Web (requires Update 2 or later)
- Visual Studio 2015 Professional or above (requires Update 2 or later)

Note that NTVS is **not available** for Visual Studio Express for Windows (or Windows Desktop)

## Changes since 1.1

### ES6 IntelliSense Preview (new analysis engine)

As many of you may already know, we've in the midst of rehauling our JavaScript IntelliSense experience. In NTVS 1.1, we gave you a sneak peek of what's to come, and you gave us a ton of awesome feedback that we've taken to heart.

HIghlights include:
- A more consistent IntelliSense experience for fullstack development
- first-class support for the most popular npm packages
- JsDoc comment support
- improved JSX support (requires Visual Studio ""15"" Preview)

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/762848/14151528/2c0ca63a-f663-11e5-9ed9-da556bc65f67.png)

To learn more about this experience, please visit the [ES6 Preview documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/wiki/ES6-IntelliSense-Preview-in-NTVS-1.1)

### Project-less debugging of Node.js code via “Open Folder” (requires Visual Studio ""15"" Preview)

In Visual Studio ""15"" Preview, we're making it easier to  edit and debug from any folder on your machine using ""File > Open Folder"".
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/762848/14153453/b9615310-f66c-11e5-8f89-b8dd16603967.png)

Then you can simply launch debugging for any javascript file in the folder without the need to set up a dedicated Visual Studio project configuration.

### More reliable editing and debugging

We expect the 1.2 Alpha release to provide both a much better user experience and improved stability. In particular, it brings increased reliability when debugging asynchronous and source-mapped code, as well as significantly increased stability and performance all around.

### (Preliminary) Node.js v6.x support

A stable Node.js v6.x isn't even out yet, but many of our users love to use the latest and greatest, and we've _already_ tested and added preliminary support for it, so please let us know if you run into any issues!

## Known Issues
- #125 Attach debugger to Azure deployment via Server Explorer fails. You can attach manually as outlined on the Advanced Debugging page.
- #434 Profiling does not resolve function names if using 64-bit Node. Install and profile 32-bit Node to work around this issue.
- ReSharper is known to cause code-completion, memory, and performance issues when enabled alongside NTVS. We recommend disabling at least ReSharper's JavaScript functionality if you are having problems.
- NTVS does not fully support build and test features of Visual Studio Team Services, but we are working to improve the experience. If you are having trouble, please file an issue so we can get to the bottom of it.

## Changes since 1.1 RC

### ES6 IntelliSense Preview (new analysis engine)

You’ve been asking for ES6 support in Node.js tools for Visual Studio and we’re excited to give you a sneak peek in NTVS 1.1 RC2! Check out the new **ES6 IntelliSense Preview** mode available in **Tools > Options > Node.js IntelliSense**. This option will enable an experimental JavaScript editing experience, powered by TypeScript.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/762848/9669955/f20e0898-523e-11e5-90df-b35df4e93ee2.png)

Head on over to [our docs](http://aka.ms/NtvsEs6Preview) to learn more about this feature and some of it's limitations. We're constantly working to improve the IntelliSense experience, so please let us know what you think.

### npm v3 Support

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/762848/9668643/922113a0-5237-11e5-8fbf-af6ea16e14ca.png)

Look familiar? We thought it [might](http://aka.ms/maxpath-workarounds)... Luckily npm v3 is [just around the corner](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.0.0), and one of the features we're most excited about is that dependencies are installed maximally flat, so you're less likely to run into [MAX_PATH issues](http://aka.ms/maxpath-workarounds). NTVS 1.1 RC2 brings full support for this latest version in both solution explorer and the analysis engine.

Ready to give npm v3 beta a spin? Either follow the [manual upgrade steps](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting#upgrading-on-windows), or take advantage of the [npm-windows-upgrade](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade) package from our friends at Microsoft DX.

### Code Snippets

You've asked, and we listened! Thanks to our awesome intern, @avitalb, we _finally_ have code snippet support in NTVS.

Simply press **Ctrl+K +X** to browse and select a snippet to insert, or type in the snippet name and press tab to complete it. Alternatively, highlight some existing code and press **Ctrl+K+S** to surround with. And of course, you can always modify or add your own snippets through the Snippet manager.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/762848/9668432/47a134c8-5236-11e5-8a93-02eef56d0b4f.png)

Write a great code snippet that you'd like to share? [Let us know](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/issues) - we may be able to include it in the next update of NTVS.

### Performance Improvements

Slow project load times are a drag, but not anymore. We have significantly improved our performance during project load when the dependency tree is large.  In some cases we have seen over 80% gain in load times of large projects.

### Debugging

We recently [fixed an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/pull/406) during debug-attach that was causing flakey debugging experiences for some users. So if breakpoints weren't working properly sometimes, or your app was having trouble running under the debugger, or things were generally inconsistent then hopefully this'll help :smiley:. Still running into issues with the latest release? _Please_ let us know by [filing an issue](http://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/issues), and we'll try to get to it by 1.1 RTM.

### Telemetry

We :heart: Node.js, and strive to make NTVS to be the best Node.js development experience out there. So thank you so much to everyone who's already been active in the community here on GitHub. To help us further understand our user base, we will be collecting unidentifiable usage data to learn how we can make the experience even better.

We are extremely careful about instrumenting the code for telemetry for the following reasons.
- User Privacy - You can learn more about our privacy policy [here.](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=528096&clcid=0x409)
- Performance - We ensure that the telemetry instrumentation does not negatively impact the performance of this product. 

We have only added a [couple of instrumentation points](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/pull/381) in this release, and we will be as transparent as possible with any future telemetry points we add to improve our learning on the usage of NTVS. And as always, please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

### Live Diagnostics Pane

There are some issues we just can't reproduce, so in order to help us track them down, we've added a new optional Live Diagnostics Pane, which you can enable by going to **Tools** > **Node.js Tools** > **Diagnostic Info...**, and check the **Enable Node.js Tools Live Diagnostics output pane** box. Then, during your debug sessions, output will be available in the **Node.js Tools Live Diagnostics** output pane

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/762848/9069425/01571078-3a9e-11e5-9224-1d8b95016ecf.png)

See https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/issues/246#issuecomment-127715686 for more information, and thanks in advance for helping us track down these issues! 

### Numerous bug fixes

All across the product numerous issues have been fixed. We expect the RC release to provide both a much better user experience and improved stability. We would like to thank all of the people who took their time to report issues, send feedback for this release. We very much appreciate your help! 

## Known Issues
- #359 - Cloud deployment fails in certain scenarios. This issue will be fixed by in the next release, but in the meantime, you can work around the issue by unchecking the **Show labels denoting browser and Node.js code in Solution Explorer** option in **Tools > Options > Node.js Tools**
- ReSharper is known to cause code-completion, memory, and performance issues when enabled alongside NTVS. We recommend disabling at least ReSharper's JavaScript functionality if you are having problems.
- NTVS does not fully support build and test features of Visual Studio Online, but we are working to improve the experience. If you are having trouble, please file an issue so we can get to the bottom of it.
- We are constantly working to improve our code-completion and formatting to support the wide variety of modules and code styles. Please file an issue if you are running into unexpected behavior.

## Changes since 1.1 Beta

### IntelliSense

#### Significantly improved performance

We've improved overall code analysis performance in this release by adding a new limit in place based on the depth of the npm tree so we don't have to analyze _the world_.

Additionally, we've added a new **Quick IntelliSense** mode available in **Options > Node.js IntelliSense** to limit it even further if you're still running into issues.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/762848/8736673/9da2a588-2bcf-11e5-9df2-834f0f7fc9fa.png)

We're constantly working to improve the IntelliSense experience, so please let us know what you think of these improvements (especially if you notice a dip in quality of completions.)

#### Browser-mode for working with the DOM

There are tons of full-stack Node devs out there who are living in both browser-land and Node-land, and we've had _many_ questions how to enable IntelliSense for the DOM... On the one hand we want to reduce clutter in the completions list, but on the other hand we want to provide as flexible an experience as possible. There was always a _way_ to enable proper editing of DOM code within NTVS, but hats off to anyone who managed to discover it on their own.

In an effort to make this feature more discoverable and easier to use, we've introduced an explicit node/browser label on folders containing javascript files. Additionally, you can right click on any directory, and select **Set as Content (browser code)** or **Set as Compile (Node.js code)** to toggle between modes.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/762848/8736352/993ad70c-2bcc-11e5-9af8-545e2ff01925.png)

And of course, if you want to turn the labels off once you've configured your project, there's a new option to do so in:
**Options > Node.js Tools > Show labels denoting browser and Node.js code in Solution Explorer**

### Debugger improvements

We fixed a race condition that was preventing many folks from launching the debugger in all sorts of unexpected ways. So if breakpoints weren't working properly sometimes, or your app was having trouble running under the debugger, or things were generally inconsistent then hopefully this'll help :smiley:.

Additionally we've fixed a source mapping bug that should make it a little easier to debug your TypeScript code if the output is being mapped to a single file. 

### Unit test running and debugging

We now adhere to a default 2 second timeout when running mocha unit tests, so your test runs should complete more quickly.

Additionally, we've added the ability to configure mocha by adding a config file to the project located at `$(ProjectDirectory)\test\mocha.json`. Adding the mocha.json file will result in the mocha tests running with the options specified. An example of a valid mocha.json file is:

``` json
{
    ""ui"": ""tdd"",
    ""timeout"": 300000,
    ""reporter"": ""xunit""
}
```

And lastly, we've fixed some issues where tests with certain names weren't properly discovered/run, added better error logging so you can more easily track down issues in the future, _and_ fixed that pesky bug preventing unit test debugging in VS 2015.

### npm Integration

In this release, we've introduced an ""Open Documentation"" command on npm packages that lets you quickly hop to the documentation. It's the little things :smiley:. 

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/762848/8736787/88b737a0-2bd0-11e5-840b-c8ca27d24b74.png)

### New Dockerfile template

Docker is all the rage now, so to make it just a little easier to get started... we've added a new Linux-based dockerfile template (based on node:latest). Simply right click your project, select ""Add New Item"", and select the Dockerfile template to generate a Dockerfile for your project based on your current project settings.

### Numerous bug fixes

All across the product numerous issues have been fixed. We expect the RC release to provide both a much better user experience and improved stability. We would like to thank all of the people who took their time to report issues, send feedback for this release. We very much appreciate your help! 

## Known Issues
- [VS2013 only] Be sure to customize the .gitignore file that Visual Studio places into your solution when you enable git source control, otherwise you may face issues with commits or continuous deployment.
- ReSharper is known to cause code-completion, memory, and performance issues when enabled alongside NTVS. We recommend disabling at least ReSharper's JavaScript functionality if you are having problems.
- NTVS does not fully support build and test features of Visual Studio Online, but we are working to improve the experience. If you are having trouble, please file an issue so we can get to the bottom of it.
- We are constantly working to improve our code-completion and formatting to support the wide variety of modules and code styles. Please file an issue if you are running into unexpected behavior.
