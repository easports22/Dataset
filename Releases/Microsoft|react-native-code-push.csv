### New Features
1. Adds support for both React Native 0.34 and 0.35. Thanks so much for your patience!
2. Updates will now be downloaded from a CDN to improve performance for users globally. To maintain backwards compatibility for those using a whitelist of approved URL endpoints, this will only apply from this release onwards.
3. Allows the `node_modules` path to be overriden in `codepush.gradle`. Thanks @geof90!

### Bug Fixes (iOS)
1. Uses `NativeEventEmitter` and `RCTEventEmitter` instead of the deprecated `DeviceEventEmitter`. Thanks for kicking this off @Pho3nix!
2. Adds a class guard in `initialize` methods to allow for clean sub-classing, and fix a build warning about implicit type conversion. Thanks @daniel-beard!

### Bug Fixes (Android)
1. Fixes a crash that may happen when `CodePush.getUpdateMetadata()` is called when running against the binary version and an update is pending. Thanks @cmcewen!
2. Prevents a hash mismatch issue that may sometimes occur due to `.DS_Store` and `__MACOSX`files generated on OS X (this was previously fixed on iOS only).
3. Removes unnecessary config from `AndroidManifest.xml` to fix manifest merging issues. Thanks @felipecsl!

### Bug Fixes (Universal Windows Platform)
1. Fixes an issue where rollbacks can occur erroneously when using `InstallMode.SILENT`. Thanks @rozele!
2. Fixes an issue where the app can hang when resuming while using `InstallMode.ON_NEXT_RESUME`. Thanks @rozele!
3. Fixes an issue where update check results were being cached for the lifetime of the app. Thanks for diagnosing this @rozele!

1. Adds support for setting a custom `ReactNativeHolder` via `CodePush.setReactInstanceHolder()`. This is useful if you're explicitly launching a React Native instance without an Activity (for example, from within a native push notification receiver). For these situations, CodePush must be told how to find your React Native instance in order to execute a forced restart whenever an update is installed. Thanks @igrayson for your contribution!
2. Exposes `isPendingUpdate` and `isFailedHash` publicly on the iOS native API, however these are not documented methods, so they may run the risk being broken by future releases. Thanks @daniel-beard!

### Bug Fixes
1. For android users using React Native v0.32, during forced app restarts, due to changes in React Native internal APIs we would end up using the legacy logic that recreates the current activity, which does not result in the best experience. This is fixed in this release.
2. Fixes a nil object insertion crash which occurs when a rollback is triggered while there is no current update present.
3. Prevent crashes caused by NSError nil pointer dereferences throughout the iOS native API. Thanks @daniel-beard!

### New Features
1. `react-native link react-native-code-push` now automates all of the linking process for you. For Android, it imports the `react-native-code-push` library project for you and adds the `codepush.gradle` build step in `settings.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle`, prompts you for your deployment key and modifies the `MainApplication` / `MainActivity` java file for you to include the CodePush react package and consult CodePush for the path to the root JS bundle file. For iOS, it similarly also adds the CodePush project to your XCode project, prompts you for your deployment key, adds it to your `Info.plist` file, and updates your `AppDelegate.m` file to consult CodePush for the path to your root JS bundle file.

### Bug Fixes
1. Removed the dependency on SoLoader. We earlier relied on it being there as a transitive dependency of React Native, however after the release of React Native 0.31 where it was made an external dependency, there were some reported runtime issues with being unable to resolve the library.

### New Features
1. The default export of `react-native-code-push` can now also be used as a decorator function which takes in some options and wraps your root component in a higher order ""CodePush"" component. This component then handles syncing with the server for updates for you. Internally, the higher order component calls `codePush.sync()` at the right trigger events (e.g. when the app resumes). It also ensures that `notifyAppReady()` is called when the component mounts, so issues like https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/360 wouldn't happen.

Going forward, we intend to have this new decorator function be the primary way in which users instrument their app with CodePush instead of calling `codePush.sync()` directly, although the old method still works and can be used.

It also enables beta distribution for developers who would not like to increment their app store version between each iteration.

It also adds a few bug fixes and minor enhancements. It is available now on NPM and can be installed via the following command: `npm i --save react-native-code-push@latest`.

### New Features (Android)
1. **Added support for Android in React Native v0.29!** The `CodePush` class includes a new constructor which accepts the `MainApplication` instance, instead of the `MainActivity` instance, which allows it to be initialized within the new `ReactNativeHost` object which is used in React Native v0.29. Check out the [updated docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#plugin-configuration-android) for details on how to configure CodePush with this React Native version.
2. We aliased the `CodePush.getBundleFile` Java method as `CodePush.getJSBundleFile` to be more idiomatic with the respective methods in the `ReactNativeHost` and `ReactActivity` classes. `CodePush.getBundleFile` is now marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

### New Features (General)
1. The object returned from `getUpdateMetadata` is now a fully-compliant `LocalPackage` instance (e.g. includes an `install` method). Thanks @nevir for this contribution!
2. The `notifyAppReady` method now returns a `StatusReport` object which indicates whether an update was successfully installed or rolled back. Thanks @nevir for this contribution!

### Bug Fixes
1. **Binary hashing has been fixed in React Native v0.29+** Our plugin supports hashing the contents of the binary in order to prevent installing an update that is equivalent to what was shipped in the store. Unfortunately, this feature was broken for a few releases due to a change in React Native itself, but it now works correctly in React Native v0.29+.

### New Features
1. **Restarts can be disallowed during critical end user workflows** The Javascript API exposes a new `disallowRestart` method which allows a component to ensure that no programmatic update restarts can occur while it is mounted (resulting in a ""quick flash"" that some users may think is a crash). This can help prevent end user interruptions during periods where it would be unacceptable (e.g. an on boarding process), but without preventing the app to discover and download available updates as soon as possible (via a call to `allowRestart`). Check out [the docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#codepushdisallowrestart) for more details.

### Bug Fixes
1. Our podspec includes a new `NoZip` subspec to allow apps that already include `SSZipArchive` to link with CodePush, without receiving duplicate symbol errors
2. A bug was fixed with install metrics reporting when an update is successfully installed after a previous update had been rolled back.

It is now available on NPM and can be installed via `npm i --save react-native-code-push`.

### Performance Improvements
1. The download progress events that are triggered when calling either `sync` or `RemotePackage.download` are no longer dispatched to the JS thread unless the app actually specified a `downloadProgressCallback`. Additionally, even if an app subscribed to download progress events, we now throttle them along with the device's vsync, so that the CodePush plugin doesn't overwhelm the JS thread with more events than it can actually render, and ensures that we impose a small impact as little an impact on the app's frame rate as possible.

### Bug Fixes (iOS)
1. CodePush updates are now explicitly excluded from iTunes and/or iCloud backups, which ensures that they don't impact the end users storage capacity, and also prevents any App Store rejections based on their storage guidelines.

### New Features
1. **Metadata about the currently running update can now be reliably retrieved** The existing `getCurrentPackage` method allowed programmatically retrieving the metadata for CodePush updates (e.g. what is its label? is it mandatory?), but unfortunately, it would always return the ""latest"" locally available update, which could either be the running update or a pending update. Therefore, there wasn't a reliable way to get the metadata for the update that is currently running, that disregarded any pending updates To address this, we are deprecating the `getCurrentPackage` method and replacing it with a new `getUpdateMetadata` method that allows explicitly specifying whether you want the metadata for the running, pending or latest (using the same behavior as `getCurrentPackage`) update. Check out the [docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#codepushgetupdatemetadata) for more details.
   
   ``` javascript
   import codePush, { UpdateState } from ""react-native-code-push"";
   
   // Reliably get the running update metadata
   // Both of these calls are equivalent
   codePush.getUpdateMetadata();
   codePush.getUpdateMetadata(UpdateState.RUNNING);
   
   // Check if there is a pending update, and if so, get its metadata
   codePush.getUpdateMetadata(UpdateState.PENDING);
   
   // Provides the same behavior as the existing getCurrentPackage method.
   // The return object still contains the isPending property to determine
   // if the latest update is pending or not.
   codePush.getUpdateMetadata(UpdateState.LATEST);
   ```
2. The `notifyApplicationReady` method has been aliased as `notifyAppReady` to be more consistent with the use of ""App"" instead of ""Application"" in most React Native APIs (e.g. `AppRegistry`, `AppState`). To prevent a breaking change, `notifyApplicationReady` isn't removed, but our docs will prescribe the new alias moving forward.

### Bug Fixes (iOS)
1. We resolved a bug where CodePush updates on disk weren't correctly being cleared after bumping the app version when using React Native packager as opposed to specifying `[CodePush bundleURL]` as your JS bundle location.

### Bug Fixes
1. Fixed an issue with programmatic restarts (e.g. calling `CodePush.restartApp`, specifying any `InstallMode` value other than `ON_NEXT_RESTART` when calling `sync`) on pre-KitKat Android devices.
2. Removed the pre-release version tag from our podspec (`-beta`), which was causing issues for apps being submitted to iTunes Connect. We could have just documented this [workaround](https://github.com/Jonge/Cocoapods-frameworks-version-number-fix), but it seemed like a better solution for our users to just remove it on our end, since our NPM packages and GitHub releases already include the `-beta` semantics.

It is now available on NPM and can be updated immediately by running `npm i --save react-native-code-push@latest`.

### New Features (Android)
1. **App restarts are now much smoother for the end user** Previously, when an app was restarted in order to apply a CodePush update, we would stop and re-start the `Activity` that represented the current React Native app. While this method worked, it had the effect of being a fairly obtrusive user experience. This release improves the restart by doing a reload of the React Native bridge, which is able to re-use the existing `Activity` and simply results in a quick ""flash"" when reloading the new JS bundle file. This experience mirrors what we already have on iOS and should be a lot nicer for your users.
2. **RNPM-based installs now generate the CodePush package code correctly** When you run `rpm link react-native-code-push`, it will update your `MainActivity` class with the right constructor call to the `CodePush` class (instead of generating `new CodePush()` which isn't a valid signature), which further simplifies the installation experience.
3. **RNPM-based installs now prompt you for your CodePush deployment key** If you're using RNPM >=1.6.0 (we recommend it!), when you run `rpm link react-native-code-push`, you will be prompted for your Android deployment key, which will be used to auto-populate your `MainActivity` file. You can choose to ignore this for now and specify it later using our [configuration instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#plugin-configuration-android). We hope to add support for iOS as soon as RNPM allows automating the creation of `Info.plist` entries.

It is now available on NPM and can be updated immediately by running `npm i --save react-native-code-push@latest`.

### New Features (Android)
1. **RNPM-based installation is now fully supported and documented** We had to make a few breaking changes to our Java API to achieve this (see below for details), but we believe it will be worth it in the long run, since RNPM will greatly simplify adding CodePush to new projects and/or re-installing it in existing projects after performing a React Native upgrade. View the updated [Android install docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#plugin-configuration-android) for more details.
2. The `CodePush.getBundleUrl` Java method now includes an overloaded version that takes no parameters, and assumes your JS bundle name is `index.android.bundle`. This is what most people name it, so this is just a simple codification of an already ubiquitous convention. [More details](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#static-methods)

### Breaking Changes (Android)
1. The `CodePush` class itself is now a `ReactPackage`, and therefore, you can construct an instance of it, and directly add it to the list of packages in your `MainActivity.getPackages` method. Because of this, the `CodePush.getReactPackage` method has been removed from the `CodePush` class since it is no longer needed. View the updated [Android install docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#plugin-configuration-android) for more details about how this class is expected to be used now.
2. The `CodePush.getBundleUrl` method is now static, which allows you to easily call it from within your `MainActivity.getJSBundleFile` method, without needing to maintain a local member variable for the `CodePush` class instance. View the updated [Android install docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#plugin-configuration-android) for more details about how this method is expected to be used now.

### New Features
1. **Added client-side support for the new release rollout feature in the CLI** This version of the React Native SDK is required in order to begin taking advantage of this new capability, so make sure to upgrade your apps before attempting to release updates with a rollout percentage. [More details](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/cli/README.md#rollout-parameter)
   
   ``` shell
   code-push release-react MyApp ios --rollout 25%
   ```
2. **Added support for throttling resume-based installs** We've seen a lot of developers want to use the resume-based install strategy, in order to get their updates in front of their end users sooner. However, forcing a restart on the next resume might be too obtrusive if the user switched away from the app for only a few seconds (e.g. to respond to a text). In order to help get updates in front of users sooner, while still respecting their workflow, the `sync` method now accepts a new option called `minimumBackgroundDuration` that specifies the number of seconds that the app needs to have been in the background before forcing the install. [More details](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/cli/README.md#rollout-parameter)
   
   ``` javascript
   // If the app was in the background for 10 minutes, we assume that it is ""safe"" to restart to install the update
   codePush.sync({ installMode: codePush.InstallMode.ON_NEXT_RESUME, minimumBackgroundDuration: 10 * 60 });
   ```

### Bug Fixes (General)
1. When an update is downloaded from the CodePush server, the plugin now looks for the JS bundle file using the exact same file name that was specified as being contained in the binary (via either `[CodePush bundleURL]` or `CodePush.getBundleURL`), as opposed to looking for the first file with a `.jsbundle`, `.bundle` or `.js` extension. This makes the update E2E more reliable, and prevents issues for apps that use local `<WebView>` hosted content.

### Bug Fixes (iOS)
1. The contents of the app binary are now successfully hashed for apps that aren't using React Native assets
2. A custom error message is displayed when using `[CodePush bundleURL]` in your `AppDelegate.m` file, and deploying a debug build to the iOS Simulator. React Native doesn't generate a JS bundle in the binary in this circumstance, and it has confused many CodePush users. To help alleviate the confusion, we now explain the issue as well as a few possible workarounds.

### Bug Fixes (Android)
1. Cleaned up a bunch of lint warnings that didn't impact behavior, but may have been noisy for devs integrating CodePush into a native Android app
2. Fixed an interop bug for apps that are using CodePush along with the Fabric SDK

### New Features
1. The `sync` method now accepts a new option called `mandatoryInstallMode`, which allows you to individually customize the install mode that is used for optional and mandatory updates. This new property defaults to `InstallMode.IMMEDIATE` (which is what we've found most devs want), but can be changed by passing a different value when calling `sync` (e.g. `codePush.sync({ mandatoryInstallMode: codePush.InstallMode.ON_NEXT_RESUME })`).
2. The contents of the binary are now hashed and sent to the CodePush server so that we can detect whether an available update is equivalent to what the end-user is already running. This helps prevent the unnecessary first-run update issue, and we now encourage developers to release their binary contents to CodePush to help solve this scenario, as well as enable diff updates for the initial CodePush update after a fresh binary install/update.
3. When we download a diff update from the server, and merge its contents together with the previous update (or binary contents), we now validate the contents of the entire update on the client-side to ensure integrity.

### Bug Fixes
1. We removed our use of `Promise.prototype.done` for compatibility with all `Promise` implementations, since we were seeing instances where folks were overriding the default React Native polyfill
2. We fixed our podspec to support CodePush being built as a framework in Swift apps using CocoaPods.
3. We removed the requirement for apps to include a patch component in their version (e.g. `2.0` as opposed to `2.0.0`), so you can now release updates for apps, without needing to change your versioning policies
4. Added some better diagnostic logging in certain scenarios (e.g. when the native module wasn't properily configured).

### Breaking Changes (General)
1. With the addition of the new `mandatoryInstallMode` option for `sync` (described above), by default, mandatory updates will now be installed immediately. From our experience, this is what most developers were already doing or wanted to do, but just keep this change in mind, since it's possible that it would impact your existing update experience once you upgrade the plugin.

### Breaking Changes (iOS)
1. We refactored the code a little bit, and because of this, when you update, you'll need to fix the Xcode project reference for CodePush. This just requires re-running step #2 from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#plugin-installation-ios---manual) again, using the new `xcodeproj` path in the docs.

It is now available on NPM and can be updated immediately by running `npm i --save react-native-code-push@latest`.

### Bug Fixes (iOS)
1. When the `Promise` returned by `getCurrentPackage` was rejected (rare but possible), the native-side wasn't properly returning from the method, and therefore, it would attempt to resolve the `Promise` as well, which would result in a ""Callback with id [ID] not found"" error.

### Breaking Changes
1. The `getCurrentPackage` method now returns `null` when the currently running JS bundle is coming from the binary and not from a CodePush update. This is the behavior that most people expected, but in case you're using `getCurrentPackage` and not currently checking for a `null` object as the resolved value of its `Promise`, you need to make sure to update that. Note that this isn't a server change, and therefore, existing production apps are unaffected. This breaking change only affects apps that upgrade to 1.7.3+ and continue calling `getCurrentPackage` without checking for `null`.

### Bug Fixes (General)
1. We saw a few cases where apps were inadvertently calling the `sync` method multiple times concurrently (e.g. they called `sync` in `componentDidMount` as well as an `AppState` change handler), which had the potential to put the app in a weird state. Now, when `sync` is called, and a previous `sync` call is still in progress (e.g. an update is downloading), it will resolve the promise with a new sync status of `SYNC_IN_PROGRESS`. That way, we can safeguard the runtime from getting into a bad state, while still providing the app with an indication of why each `sync` call completed.

### Bug Fixes (iOS)
1. If a developer's desktop clock wasn't synchronized with their testing device (i.e. it was significantly ahead of it), it would be possible to hit an issue where your app downloads a CodePush update, but after restart, continues to use the JS bundle that was shipped with the binary. This was because the `[CodePush bundleURL]` logic saw that the binary bundle was newer than the CodePush update, and therefore, gave it precedence. We no longer rely on this time-based heuristic for detecting whether to use the binary or CodePush update on app start, and therefore, this issue would no longer be possible in the rare cases that we saw it.

### Bug Fixes (Android)
1. We removed the superfluous NDK config from our `build.grade` file (we don't have any C++ code!), which was causing compilation errors for apps that use both the NDK and CodePush.

This feature depends on React Native v0.19.0, so you'll need to update to that version of the platform in order to consume this CodePush release. We think it's extremely worth it though! (e.g. you get new debugging support for unhandled promises). This update is now available in NPM and can be installed immediately!

### New Features (Android)
1. Deploy updates to your assets on Android via CodePush. This works exactly like it does for iOS: instead of simply uploading your JS bundle to CodePush, you upload a directory containing your bundle and assets, and everything works great. The server supports differential updates, so your end-users will only get the files that changed between releases (i.e. they won't have to download all of your assets every time you release an update). Check out the CLI docs for the [`release` command](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/cli/README.md#releasing-app-updates) for more details.

### New Features (iOS)
1. We added a new method to the `CodePush` class called `setDeploymentKey` which allows you to dynamically set your deployment key in Objective-C, as opposed to specifying it in the `Info.plist` file.

### Breaking Changes
1. This release depends on React Native 0.19.0, so if you choose to upgrade CodePush, then you need to also upgrade your React Native dependency.
2. The newly added install metrics feature now only reports data to the server in release builds. Therefore, if you are testing your app and want to see this data populated in the CLI, you'll need to generate a release build first. This change was made to reduce noise from the metrics that are generated during debugging.

It is now available on NPM and can be upgraded to immediately. 

### Bug Fixes (iOS)
1. In order to perform a programmatic app restart after an update has been installed, the CodePush plugin needs to update the `RCTBridge.bundleURL` property to point at the latest JS bundle file on disk. React Native 0.18.0 made this property `readonly` (in it's interface), and therefore, cause a compilation error with our plugin, since we could no longer set it. At runtime, this property is still `readwrite`, so we simply use KVC to set the property, instead of relying on the ""dot syntax"" that the compiler didn't like. In the future, we'll use the more appropriate solution of importing the new `RCTBridge+Private.h` header file, but for now, we wanted to maintain backwards combat so that this release didn't force all of our users to upgrade to React Native 0.18.0-RC.

### Bug Fixes (General)
1. Update assets (e.g. the JS bundle and images) weren't being removed from disk after being automatically rolled back due to a crash. This wouldn't have impacted the user experience, and unless you released a significant amount of CodePush updates that included a crash (please don't do this!), this wouldn't result in much disk space being used either. That said, we don't want to consume any more of the end users storage capacity than is absolutely necessary, so this was an important fix for cleanliness sake.
2. Internal CodePush state (e.g. the list of updates that have previously failed) wasn't being properly cleared when a new binary was installed. It would be pretty rare for this behavior to have caused any issues, but it's more deterministic for us to treat each new binary installation as a ""clean slate"" since we can't make many assumptions about the new ""environment"" (e.g. which CodePush updates will work within it). 

### Feature Enhancements
1. The `restartApp` method now includes an optional parameter that lets you specify whether you want to always restarts the app, or only if there is a pending update. This makes it simpler to implement a ""forced restart"" solution at some well-known point within your app (after installing a non-immediate update), without having to check `LocalPackage.isPending` before calling `restartApp`.

Because of this breaking change, you need to uninstall your app from the emulator/devices your testing against before upgrading. It can be immediately acquired from NPM, and includes the following improvements:

### Breaking Changes (iOS and Android)
1. The `rollbackTimeout` parameter of both the `sync` and `LocalPackage.install` methods have been removed. We received a lot of feedback regarding this parameter being pretty confusing, and it also required devs to opt-in to receiving client-side rollback protection. We believe that this behavior is extremely important for doing production deployments, and therefore, in order to be more prescriptive, calling `sync` and `LocalPackage.install` will now automatically enable rollback protection, and it cannot be disabled (why would you want to do that anyways?) <br /><br />If you are calling `sync` on app start (e.g. the `componentDidMount` method of your root component), then you don't need to do anything else. Your updates will be made available to users, but if you accidentally release something bad, you can rest assured that your users will be automatically rolled back. However, if you are calling `sync` somewhere else (e.g. button click, within a periodic timer), you **MUST** call `notifyApplicationReady` after your app has successfully started (e.g. in your root component's `componentDidMount` event), which lets the CodePush runtime know that the update is valid and won't automatically roll the end-user back to the previous version. <br /><br />
   We've found that the vast majority of users are calling `sync` in `componentDidMount`, and therefore, this change automatically makes your deployments more reliable, without doing any work!

### Bug Fixes (Android)
1. When dev support is enabled, the React Native runtime attempts to load the JS bundle from a locally available cache. This can create a confusing workflow when using CodePush, since it's possible to install an update, restart the app, and not see the changes applied. This occurs because the app might still be using the older cached file, and CodePush is effectively not being consulted. The CodePush plugin now deletes the React Native cache whenever an update is installed. This will have the effect of loading the JS bundle from the packager (if running), or the bundle file downloaded from CodePush.
2. There were some instances where an installed update wouldn't be correctly applied when running your app in an emulator. This has now been addressed, and updates should work great across all emulators and devices.

1. When an error occurs during a call to `sync` (e.g. missing deployment key in `Info.plist` file), that error message is now logged to the console (e.g. `adb logcat`, Chrome, Xcode console). Previously, we would only log ""Unknown error"", which wasn't particularly useful. If an app was calling `done` on the `Promise` returned by `sync`, any errors would have resulted in a red box, so this issue only really impacted scenarios where the error was being completely swallowed and the console didn't provide any indication of the cause.
2. We were previously writing the update contents (e.g. JS bundle, images) to the app's `Documents` folder, whereas the iOS guidelines recommend using the `Library\Application Support` directory for content that shouldn't be end-user visible. Because of this change, you should uninstall your app from any devices or simulators in order to clean out the `Documents` folder. The plugin automatically cleans out old updates when installing a new one, but with this fix, it won't attempt to clean out the `Documents` folder anymore. This won't impact any user experience, however, it's just for cleanliness sake.
3. The iOS plugin was erroneously giving priority to the JS bundle contained in the binary in some instances. If you're installing an update but still seeing an older version of your app after restarting, it it likely this bug, and you should update your NPM dependency to this release.

It currently only works for iOS, but we're working on Android support. In the meantime, you can still use CodePush and the new assets system on Android, and nothing will break, you just won't be able to add/edit images via CodePush like you can with iOS.

In order to support this change, we needed to rely on v0.15.0 of React Native, so if you're still using v0.14.*, we recommend sticking with v1.3.0 of CodePush. That said, we think the new asset system is awesome, and is way worth upgrading, so we encourage you to do it :)

Additionally, once you are using the assets system, you are no longer simply releasing updates of your JS bundle file, and therefore, you'll need to change your CodePush workflow a little bit. Refer to the [docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#releasing-asset-updates---ios) for all the details here. We promise that it's still simple!

_Note: If you aren't using the new React Native assets system, then you can continue to release only your JS bundle to CodePush, and rely on your images to be loaded from the binary. CodePush won't break this workflow in any way._

### Breaking Changes (General)
1. As mentioned above, this version of CodePush requires v0.15.0 of React Native. Even if you're not using the assets system or you are but on Android, this release of the CodePush plugin requires you to upgrade your RN dependency.

### Breaking Changes (iOS)
1. This upgrade requires an additional setup step for iOS to link the `libz` library with your app (we use it to unzip updates which contain the JS bundle and images). Refer to step #5 in the [iOS installation section](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#plugin-installation---ios) of the docs to see how to do this. If you upgrade your plugin and see a bunch of weird errors, this is likely the reason.
2. If your app was already using the new assets system and deployed updates to CodePush that only specified a JS bundle, you need to do another release via the CLI which includes your assets and bundle ([details here](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#releasing-asset-updates---ios)). When the plugin installs an update that contains only a JS bundle, it assumes you aren't using the React Native assets system, and therefore, won't copy over your existing assets in the binary to the location that the update is written to (and your app layout will be broken). As mentioned above, if you aren't using the new assets system, you can keep releasing just the JS bundle, and your release workflow doesn't need to change.

Please refer to the docs for more information regarding the behavior of the following API additions/modifications. You can update your `react-native-code-push` installation from NPM immediately to take advantage of these improvements.

### New features (General)
- Android support! This has been our #1 user request thus far, and so we're excited to get it out there. The Android API includes complete parity with iOS, including the new features mentioned in this release below.
- The `sync` method now include a `syncStatusChangedCallback` parameter, which allows you to listen for state changes in the overall update process (e.g. update is available, download starting) and respond accordingly. This allows you to let the `sync` method handle the entire update process, while still having the option to display custom UI and/or perform additional behavior as needed.
- The `sync` and `RemotePackage.download` methods now include a `downloadProgressCallback` parameter, which allows you to listen to progress events when an available update is being downloaded. This was a very common request and allows you to choose to show a download progress modal experience in your app.
- The `sync` and `LocalPackage.install` method now accept an `InstallMode` parameter which allows you to determine whether the update should be installed immediately (the previous behavior), on the next app restart (to support fully silent installs) or on the next app resume.
- The `sync` method now accepts an `updateDialog` parameter, which allows you to enable/disable the user confirmation, as well as customize its strings when displayed. The change, along with the `InstallMode` change above is what fully enables ""silent updates"" (see below for breaking changes with `sync`).
- The `sync` and `checkForUpdate` methods now accept an optional `deploymentKey` parameter, which allows you to override the value that was specified in the `Info.plist` file (iOS) or `MainActivity.java` (Android). This enables you to build your app against a specific deployment (i.e. Production) and then dynamically ""redirect"" it at a different deployment
- A new `restartApp` method was added to the `react-native-code-push` module, which allows your app to force a restart at any time. This can be useful when you choose not to install an available update immediately (e.g. when performing ""silent"" updates), but your app has a deterministic event that can be used to ""force"" the update instead of waiting for the user to restart/resume the app (e.g. when a form is submitted or a user navigates to the home route).
- When your app is configured to used the packager for debugging, a CodePush update will no longer re-direct the React Native Bridge from the HTTP URL to the update file on disk. This change allows you to efficiently debug your app, as well as your CodePush update experience, without interrupting your flow as soon as an update is applied.

### New features (iOS)
- Besides the `[CodePush bundleURL]` method, which assumes your JS bundle is named `main.jsbundle`, the `CodePush` class now includes a `bundleURLForResource:` method (which lets you override the bundle name) and the `bundleURLForResource:withExtension:` method (which lets you override both the bundle name and extension).

### Breaking changes (General)
- This plugin now requires React Native v0.14.0 or greater. We needed to take advantage of some recent changes in the platform and choose to up our version requirement. If this is going to impact you, please let us know.
- The `sync` method is now ""silent"" by default, and therefore, no longer displays the user prompt when an update is available, and also doesn't immediately restart the app after installing the update. This change was made based on lots of feedback. If you want to achieve the old behavior, you simply need to enable the `updateDialog` option and change the `InstallMode` to immediate when calling sync: `codePush.sync({ userDialog: true, installMode: codePush.InstallMode.IMMEDIATE })`. 
- The `LocalPackage.apply` method has been renamed to `install` to better reflect what it's actually doing.

### Breaking changes (iOS)
- The `getBundleUrl` method of the `CodePush` class has been renamed to `bundleURL`

1. #41 - Updates are now appropriately being ""ignored"" when they are associated with an app store version other than the one which the end-user is currently running. This was always the intended behavior, but it was regressed with a feature release. Therefore, if the end-user is running v1.0.0 of your app, and the app queries CodePush for an update, it will only accepts updates that have been explicitly ""tagged"" as v1.0.0. Older versions were already ignored (for obvious reasons), and with this update, so are newer versions (e.g. v1.0.1), since it isn't clear that they would work with the end-users running version of the app binary.
2. #38 - If the JS bundle in the app binary is newer then the JS bundle from the latest CodePush update, it will be used instead of simply always using the CodePush update when one is available. This behavior is necessary so that if an end-user updates the app from the store (or whatever other means they could acquire a newer IPA file), the contents of that update will take precedent as long as it's newer.
