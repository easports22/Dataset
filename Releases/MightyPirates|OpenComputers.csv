To use the Lua 5.3 architecture, shift-rightclick a CPU while holding it in your hand to cycle through available architectures until it says Lua 5.3 in the chat and/or expanded tooltip of the CPU.

If you've been playing with a 1.5.13 dev-build (i.e. one you got from Jenkins), you'll have to manually set the option `enableLua53` to `true` in your config, because it originally wasn't until I did some stability testing.

To play with the new Lua 5.3 architecture, take a CPU and sneak-rightclick while holding it in your hand. You'll see a notification in your chat log about what architecture it is now configured for (you can also see that in the extended tooltip of the CPU).

Seriously. Do it.

Also, the version for MC 1.8 should be considered beta quality, i.e. it's not unlikely that there are some bugs and glitches still in there. If you find any, please report them. It is however feature identical to the MC 1.7 version. Well, aside from floppy label rendering and upgrades being rendered on robots.

Known issues in MC 1.8:
- Formatting in tooltips is broken.
- Loot disks don't show in creative tab when playing on a server.

**READ THE CHANGE LOG!**

This update contains some major changes, so be sure to read the change log. Also, due to these changes, this version may have some neat new bugs hidden in it, in particular in the way robots' and drones' inventories work and how they interact with the world. I did a good bit of testing, but would like to get a few more eyeballs on this before I'm declaring it somewhat stable.
- Added: `eeprom.getData`/`setData` for storing a 256-sized byte array.
- Changed: Microcontrollers are now fully sided, i.e. they do not pass power, network messages or component access anymore. They can select to which sides they send network messages, however, allowing use as advanced switches.
- Changed: Internet card now uses userdata for opened connections. The internet _library_ didn't change and remains backwards compatible. However, if you used the internet _component_ directly, you'll need to adjust your code.
- Changed: Drones can now place blocks and break blocks that can be harvested by hand.
- Changed: Robot movement restrictions added. They have a limited flight height when in mid-air now (default is eight for now, may add upgrades to boost it). Their movement logic after a good amount of discussion can be summarized as such:
  1. Robots may only move if the start or target position is valid.
  2. The position below a robot is always valid (if it isn't solid).
  3. Positions up to `<flightHeight>` above a solid block are valid.
  4. Any position that has an adjacent block with a solid face towards the position is valid.
- Changed: Methods inserting into robot/drone inventories (`*.suck()`) will now prefer inserting into the selected slot over merging into an existing stack.
- Removed: `computer.getBootAddress`/`setBootAddress`, this is replaced by `eeprom.getData`/`setData`. The new Lua BIOS will provide a temporary fallback that uses the EEPROM's new methods. _IMPORTANT_: you will need to recraft your Lua BIOSes, the old ones will error.

**IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL NOTES**
- This version should be world-compatible with 1.4, i.e. blocks and items should be safe.
- Computers _will_ stop due to computer save-state incompatibility. **You will also need to re-craft your Lua BIOSes** due to a low-level Lua API change (the one that causes the save-state incompatibility).
- There were some changes to the Java API. I don't think many mods use the parts that changed, but you may encounter issues with those until they also update.

- Added: Ability to copy lines from screens using the analyzer (shift-rightclicking the line with the analyzer), then paste it on a screen by simply rightclicking it with the analyzer.
- Added: Driver for `IDeepStorageUnit`.
- Added: New command, `/oc_preventDisassembling` (alias: `/oc_nodis`), which will mark the currently held item so that the disassembler will not work for it.
- Added: Right-clicking blocks with tablet in hand will now allow components to populate a data table. If any is given, a `tablet_use` signal is sent to the tablet, with the data passed as a table as the only parameter for the signal. Components providing data are the geolyzer and navigation upgrade for now.
- Added: Setting for whether to enable command block driver or not; defaulting to false.
- Added: Tier two and creative tablet cases. These also have space for a single container. When shift-rightclicking them, in addition to be powered off a GUI will open, giving access to the container slot, so you can, for example, insert and remove floppies on the go.
- Changed: Bumped remote terminal resolution and color depth to tier three, to keep them competitive with tablets with container slots. Will need breaking and re-placing server racks to work in existing worlds.
- Changed: Disallow breaking creative tier robots by non-creative, non-authorized players.
- Changed: Limiting number of parts allowed in network packets as a safeguard for weaker computers in addition to the existing limit of overall size.
- Changed: Lowered default geolyzer noise value (based on Wobbo's magnificent box blots).
- Changed: Make the Sides API less suprising when used with the `#` operator and `ipairs` function (benblank).
- Changed: Re-enabled `inventory_controller.getInventorySize(sides.back)` for backwards compatibility. Will be removed in 1.5, use `robot.inventorySize()`.
- Fixed: `Connector.setLocalBufferSize` registering self before adjusting size, leading to manager not adding it to the connector list if its size was zero before. In the worst case, this could lead to crashes.
- Fixed: Avoid skipping physical removal in `filesystem.remove` when a virtual object had to be removed for deleting a directory.

- Added: Comparator override to capacitor, based on its (local!) buffer fill rate.
- Added: Debug card can be bound to a player to use the player's permissions for `runCommand` by shift-rightclicking it while holding it.
- Added: Extended implementation of switch ComputerCraft peripheral to properly ""fake"" connected modems. This means OC's block components can - for the most part - now also be controlled from CC.
- Added: Make disassembler finish disassembly of added item immediately if added by a player in creative mode.
- Added: preconfigured Tablet to NEI, missed that when adding the other preconfigured stuff.
- Changed: Raid blocks will now keep their inventory when broken, allowing relocation without losing their data.
- Fixed: `filesystem.list` returning a list with duplicate values (mpmxyz).
- Fixed: AE2 integration's getCraftables returning stored stacks; now properly returning recipe output stacks.

- Added: Tier 2 Microcontroller.
- Added: Drones!
- Added: Leash Upgrade.
- Changed: A _lot_ of internal robot-related logic to allow reusing it for drones.

### Drones? Drones!

Drones are to robots as microcontrollers are to computers. They're more limited but cheaper, and have different strengths. In their case in particular: they are actual entities, so they have other options for interacting with the world. For now this is only used for one upgrade: the leash upgrade, which allows drones to leash animals and pull them around the world.
Drones can _not_ activate, break or place blocks, nor use items or tools. They're sort of glorified carrier pigeons.

To get started, I posted a short [video demonstration some basics on Youtube](http://youtu.be/W5JTRKdup7s).
The [wiki is also sort of up-to-date again](http://ocdoc.cil.li/component:drone).

### Beta?

So the above are pretty much also what I'd appreciate some help testing with: robots (in particular inventory and tank interaction), microcontrollers (in particular the T2 one) and drones (everything about them). Please report any problems you run into, thanks a lot!

- Fixed: tablets only allowing input in the world they were first started in (and possibly other related broken behavior).
- Fixed: some more minor issues.

**EEPROM**
What is this and why should you care? It's a new item that is _required_ for all devices - computers, servers, robots, tablets - to boot from now on. It contains a piece of code that was previously hard-coded in OC itself, and is the first thing that's run when the computer is powered on. Since there can be only one per computer - unlike file systems - there's no randomness to it. The standard Lua BIOS, crafted from an EEPROM and a book, does what was done before: it looks for a file system with an `init.lua` script and runs that. So business as usual. However, that also means you can now boot off of non OC file systems now! Such as code provided via the network, or tape drives from Computronics (given you write/find a filesystem layer for them).
To avoid breaking everything left and right, existing devices in the world will automatically have a Lua BIOS EEPROM inserted into the new EEPROM slot. That means all your computers running now will still be able to reboot after upgrading. When building a new computer you'll now also need to install an EEPROM in it, though.
EEPROM can be reprogrammed via its component, i.e. place the EEPROM to reprogram into a running computer, then use `component.eeprom.set(newCode)`, or use the new `flash.lua` program in OpenOS (reinstall OpenOS if necessary).

**Microcontrollers**
These are low-power, very simple computers. They cannot connect to external components - much like robots - and cannot even have a graphics card. They also cannot have a file system. Their programming must be provided exclusively by the EEPROM built into them! To make this a bit less of a pain, you can recraft them with an EEPROM to swap out the EEPROM installed in them - similar to maps with the Navigation Upgrade.
Unlike computer cases, microcontrollers will keep all their inventory when they are broken. Rather, they don't have any inventory at all. Right-clicking them just toggles whether they're powered or not. These are an answer to the request for tiny special purpose computers that you'll cram into a corner and forget about. So don't come asking for more slots or higher tier components in them. Use a full computer in those cases.
The only thing that is not possible at this point, and I'm unsure if and how I'd add it, is them supporting bundled redstone. For now it's plain redstone only, so get creative ;-)

726722,2014-11-23T00:09:03Z,2014-11-23T10:06:40Z,Version 1.4.0 - Elaine Marley,"**VERY IMPORTANT**
You _cannot downgrade_ to OC1.3, after loading your world in OC1.4, without losing converted blocks. To future-proof things, the way blocks are handled internally has been switched around a bit in 1.4. This means all of the old blocks have to be converted to the new format. For **blocks that are in the world** _this happens automatically_. For **blocks in inventories**, this also happens automatically _if they are in a player's inventory_. It's really not that big a deal, but I want to make sure you're aware of this, to avoid unnecessary confusion.
- Added: More NEI integration. When showing the usage information of an item (default is `U`, at least for me), for OC items there are now one or two new pages. One with a manual, describing the item, and one with API documentation (i.e. callbacks exposed by the component provided by the item).
- Added: `geolyzer.analyze` callback, allows reading more in-depth information on blocks directly adjacent to the geolyzer / robot / whatever the geolyzer is built into.
- Added: Database component; primarily used for AE2 export bus driver for now. Allows storing representations of item stacks to be referenced by other components. This was added to allow passing item stacks with NBT information to some callbacks without having to expose the actual NBT to scripts.
- Added: Password char support for `term.read` (e.g. `term.read(nil, nil, nil, ""*"")`).
- Added: Access lights to computer cases, disk drives and servers to indicate disk / floppy access.
- Added: Permission check when changing sign text via sign upgrade.
- Added: Better support for custom CPU architectures. In particular, when registered, OC's CPUs can be simply reconfigured to another architecture by shift-right-clicking them. Not that there are any released ones, yet, to my knowledge.
- Added: Logic to prevent putting components into devices where they could not be used anyway, e.g. redstone cards in tablets.
- Added: Wobbo's rc script system to OpenOS.
- Added: Loot disk with Magik6k's network stack.
- Changed: Integrated OpenComponents (interaction with other Mods). The OpenComponents addon is no longer required in OC 1.4 (on the contrary, it mustn't be present, because it uses the OC 1.3 API).
- Changed: Reworked power conversion. Different blocks now accept external power at different speeds. Check the tooltips!
- Changed: Reworked call limits. The speed with which certain operations can be performed in OC are controlled by ""call limits"", e.g. how many times per tick a computer may tell the graphics card to update. This is no longer per component but per computer now, and different CPUs have a different call budget - that means T3 CPUs are actually faster than T1 CPUs now.
- Changed: Improved and updated some third-party block drivers.
- Changed: The adapter now has an inventory with one slot, which can take certain upgrades such as the inventory controller, tank controller and sign upgrade. Some functionality previously provided out of the box is now only available via these upgrades when put in an adapter.
- Changed: Updated some mods' APIs.
- Changed: `robot.durability()` now returns a single number, 0 = broken, 1 = no damage. Internally this now uses handlers for specific mods' items. If you know of items from a mod that are not working as expected, let me know.
- Removed: MJ support.
- Fixed: Stuff. Probably. (Honestly, I can't remember if the recent fixes were fixes for changes introduced by 1.4, or something older...)

Also, as the version bump implies, OC's API changed enough to break stuff using the OC 1.3 API. If you're a modder using the OC API and haven't updated already, please do so at your earliest convenience. If you're not a modder but know a mod uses the OC API and hasn't updated yet, please let the author know about the change. Most of the changes won't require a lot of adjustments; to make updating less frustrating, the things that have changed in the API are [documented on the wiki](http://ocdoc.cil.li/tutorial:modding_onefour).
