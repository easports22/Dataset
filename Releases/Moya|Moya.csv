In this release there were two big changes:
1. We deprecated reactive providers and started using `rx` and `reactive` namespaces.
2. We removed `parameters`, `parameterEncoding` and expanded `task`. 

We also added Swift 4.0 support to Moya core (and preliminary for `ReactiveSwift`) where support for `RxSwift` will be in a next major release. We improved our test coverage from 76% up to 83%, added `callbackQueue`s as an option for all requests (reactive or not!), `headers` to `TargetType`, improved `AccessTokenPlugin`, started using `Single<Response>` instead of `Observable<Response>` for RxSwift normal requests and many, many more! Checkout the changelog below and have fun! üéâ There is also a [migration guide](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/blob/master/docs/MigrationGuides.md) to help you make it through! 

Oh, and if you find anything you are concerned about, [make a new Issue](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/issues/new) - or better yet, [make a PR](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/compare) with the fix! üòâ 

## Changes since 9.0.0-beta.1:
