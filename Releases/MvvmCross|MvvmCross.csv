6263090,2016-11-01T22:17:36Z,2017-05-03T09:48:38Z,,"Time for a new release of MvvmCross. Many thanks to all the contributors for this release. 

There are a few breaking changes to this release, hence the bump of version to 4.4.0. There was also a minor issue with some nuspecs, which forced us to release 4.4.1 of a few AndroidSupport packages.

Breaking changes are noted at the end of each change log below.

In general **all** Windows Phone 8.0 projects have been removed as we do not support Silverlight anymore, in preparation for switching to .NETStandard.

Here is a change log for all the repositories.

Here is the list of changes between 4.2.2 and 4.2.3, the list is a bit short this time around; many of them are simple quality of life changes to the code in the repositories, such as fixing line endings on files.

To make sure you have your git client correctly set up please do the following to avoid crazy diffs.

**On Windows**

```
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

**On Mac** 
```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```
If you are pulling changes on an already cloned repo, it might be necessary to do the following for your git client to recognize the changes to the files.
```
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
```

The list of changes is as follows

**MvvmCross main repo** 

- Normalized line endings

As mentioned in the beginning we have introduced `MvxTaskBasedBindings`, this is a potentially breaking change. Especially when using `ShouldAlwaysRaiseInpcOnUserInterfaceThread(false);` in your ViewModel, where you might get exceptions saying that UI must be updated on the UI thread. In such cases please open a [GitHub Issue](github.com/mvvmcross/mvvmcross/issues/new).

We are proud to present the new MvvmCross logo:
![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/BvdAtgT.png)

MvvmCross have switched over to [Readme.io](http://readme.io) for their website, blog, and documentation. All of this is part of a bigger change in the general style and branding of MvvmCross.

Since the project is growing and more people are joining in, to help us make MvvmCross more awesome than ever before, we are keen to keep you updated on changes, new features, samples, and other useful things. [Readme.io](http://readme.io) helps us keeping track of changes to the documentation, and even **you** could propose an edit to any documentation page!

In addition to this we have restructured the GitHub repos. They are currently split up into:
- [MvvmCross](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross)
- [Android-Support](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-AndroidSupport)
- [Forms](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Forms)
- [Plugins](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Plugins)
- [Samples](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Samples)
- [iOS-Support](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-iOSSupport)

# New namespaces and package names

We've cleaned up file names, class names, method names, namespaces, and package names. Your existing code will break if you update to MvvmCross 4.0 (sorry). We've compiled [instructions](https://mvvmcross.readme.io/docs/upgrade-to-mvvmcross-40) to help your transition to MvvmCross 4.0 run as smoothly as possible.

# Android-support

We've developed a new system to show fragments with an Android MvvmCross App. Using Attributes on your MvxFragment classes you can show any fragment on any Activity!
