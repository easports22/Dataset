•  The app and the installer are now digitally signed! You should see my name (Nicke Manarin) on the properties of the files.   
• Redesigned screen/window/area selection experience on the new recorder.  
• The app will ask before closing if there's anything being edited.  
• Added the option to save the project while saving a gif (by using the same filename).  

## Bug fixes:

♦ For some users, clicking to stop the recording was crashing the recorder.  
♦ The ""Insert recording"" action was ignoring the option of using the new recorder UI.  
♦ Added support for images with "".jpeg"" extension (same as .jpg that is supported already).  
♦ The app now remembers the last used position of the Watermark.  
♦ Pressing Esc wasn't closing the panel when the keyboard focus was inside the Free Drawing and Cinemagraph elements.

• New color quantization algorithm for the encoder 2.0.  
• An installer is available.  
• Options to automatically adjust the window based on the frame size and to automatically adjust the image zoom based on the window size (after loading a project).   
• New translation: Dutch.

♦ After unplugging a monitor, the recorder window was not adjusting its position.  
♦ The ""Go to frame"" feature was not displaying the correct frame.  
♦ After deleting frames, the project info was not being saved into the file (project.json). This was causing some false warnings while trying to load the project later via ""Recent Projects"".  
♦ Added the missing ""New Board Recording"" context menu entry on the editor window.  
♦ Several bugs with the new recorder that happened when using screens to the left or above the primary screen.
♦ The recorder feature called ""snap to window"" wasn't working with windows on screens to the left or above the primary screen.
