> Note: Our previous code signing certificate has expired, so this release is signed by a new code signing certificate. Because of this, you may receive warnings from Windows Defender SmartScreen when you run

This is primarily a maintenance release to handle issues with publishing images due to Google Blogger. They'd made some changes to how images are uploaded to Google Photos that prevent Open Live Writer from automatically configuring photo publishing. We've added some extra steps to try to configure it, and if we can't set it up for you automatically we link to a help page that shows you how to set it up.

We also added in a few smaller bug fixes and improvements listed below, mostly submitted by the community. Thanks!!!

We added a few features for better High DPI monitor support.

As part of this release, we put a lot of work into making it easier for us to publish new releases. We've automated our build and sign process, so each code check-in will build a new installer for us. There's still some work to do on the Windows Store release process, but we've got a good start on that as well. Well this doesn't immediately translate to any new feature in this release today, it will help you get more frequent updates with both bug fixes and new features going forward.

This release contains two major new features, spellchecking and categories for Google Blogger!

For spellchecking to work you'll need to have Windows 8 or newer installed (Windows 7 does not have spellchecking support) and youâ€™ll need to [install your preferred input language in Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/how-to-add-an-input-language-to-your-pc#v1h=tab01) to enable spellchecking in that language. Only one language can be spellchecked in Writer at a time, but you can change the language at any time by going to **File** > **Options** > **Spelling** and choosing a new dictionary language.

Google Blogger categories will automatically populate for easy tagging of your blog posts. In addition to categories, there are several other Google Blogger bug fixes in this release. The most notable issues were time zone differences causing scheduled posts to be scheduled at the incorrect time, failing to open drafts that were posted to Blogger, and failing to download and open posts from Blogger that are older than your most recent 500 posts.
