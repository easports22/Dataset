- better feedback on memory usage and low memory situations when creating projects
- shorter more friendly column names for JSON imports #524 
- sorting of large data sets is orders of magnitude faster #738
- almost one hundred bug fixes including fixes for some of the persistently annoying ones like cross() failures #432 
- more robust project saving and project recovery -- if you have projects in your workspace which have been renamed .project.corrupted, you may be able to recover some of the data if you rename them back to the standard .project extension

A [full list of bugs fixed](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues?direction=desc&labels=bug&milestone=1&sort=updated&state=closed) in this release is available. 

## INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE WITH GOOGLE REFINE 2.5:
- data directory has been renamed from ./Google/Refine to ./OpenRefine #777

## MAC OS X Version Requirement

The Mac kit bundles Java 7 which [requires](http://www.java.com/en/download/mac_sysreq-sm.jsp) Mac OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or later.  The files are compiled for Java 6 compatibility, so it may be possible to run it by hand using Java 6 from Apple's Software Update, but this is unsupported and not recommended.
