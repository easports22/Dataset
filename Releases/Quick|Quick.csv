Changes:

Since [v0.5.1](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/releases/tag/v0.5.1), Quick displayed incredibly long test names in the Xcode test navigator. Although the names were a little hard to read, they were necessary in order to make sure examples with duplicate names were still run correctly (see the full discussion of the issue [here](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/295)). Now, thanks to @abbeycode, test names are dramatically shorter and easier to read, and Quick still behaves properly even when identical example names are used.

When two or more examples share the same name, such as `""it_is_an_example""`, Quick now uses test names such as `""it_is_an_example""`, `""it_is_an_example_2""`, `""it_is_an_example_3""`, and so on.

Changes:
- Thanks to @morganchen12 and @jwfriese, Quick now displays more informative error messages when the describe/context/it language is used incorrectly. For example, `it(""foo"") { afterEach {} }` will now raise an exception with the message: ""'afterEach' cannot be used inside 'it', 'afterEach' may only be used inside 'context' or 'describe'.""
- Thanks to @paulyoung and @briancroom, Quick may now be installed via the Swift package manager. See the [`Package.swift` file](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/blob/master/Package.swift) file for an example of how to specify a dependency.
- A nasty issue would cause Quick to fail to execute certain tests after the user ran a specific test via the Xcode test navigator (see https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/373 and https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/439) for details. Thanks to @sharplet, this issue has been fixed.
