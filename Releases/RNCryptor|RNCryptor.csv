4240683,2016-09-27T13:44:56Z,2016-09-27T13:47:06Z,RNCryptor 5.0.1 - Swift 3 (with Cocoapods),"- Perform final decryption after HMAC validation. Fixes #185. This improves security very slightly. There is no known or proposed attack that could exploit the previous behavior, but where possible it is better to validate prior to decryption.
- Fix CocoaPods

OpenSSL encryption is not a secure format, and supporting it over-complicates RNCryptor. For those needing OpenSSL compatibility see [rnapier/RNOpenSSLCryptor](https://github.com/rnapier/RNOpenSSLCryptor).

RNCryptor now cleanly integrates with Swift as a framework. The recommended way to do this is with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), but [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is also tested and works.

A native Swift 2 version of RNCryptor is now in alpha and should be available around the time Xcode 7 is released.

Most of the rest of the changes in RNCryptor v3 are documentation and testing related. There are a few minor improvements in robustness (most are better defensive coding and do not solve actual bugs).

Going forward, I will be using [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org). Previous versions of RNCryptor have not done this.

Version 2.2 is a fairly large release. It's been almost a year since 2.1 came out, and there are many small and large bug fixes.

V2.2 updates the file format from 2 to 3. It will read format 2 files, but will only write format 3. These are not readable by RNCryptor v2.1. See Issue #77 for details. The PHP, Python, and Ruby implementations also write format 3 and read format 2 or 3.

## Security Issues
- Issue #91:  Use constant time HMAC comparisons to avoid timing attacks
- Issue #77: KeyForPassword() broken for multi-byte passwords (UTF-8)

## Other Noteable Changes
- Improved PHP, Python, and Ruby implementations
- Improved test cases, with test vectors
- Issue #76: Support OSX in podspec
- Resolved static analyzer warnings
- Ensure compatibility with iOS 4.2
- Accept settings to RNDecryptor (Issue #65)
- Copy password rather than retain it (Issue #64)
- Crash when reading v1 header
