6137869,2017-04-19T15:57:30Z,2017-04-20T15:51:25Z,4.0.0,"**Breaking API Changes:**

- Introduced a new Subscription API (#203) - @Ben-G, @mjarvis, @DivineDominion

  - The subscription API provides basic operators, such as `skipRepeats` (skip calls to `newState` unless state value changed) and `select` (sub-select a state).

  - This is a breaking API change that requires migrating existing subscriptions that sub-select a portion of a store's state:

    - Subselecting state in 3.0.0:

      ```swift
      store.subscribe(subscriber) { ($0.testValue, $0.otherState?.name) }
      ```
    - Subselecting state in 4.0.0:

      ```swift
      store.subscribe(subscriber) {
        $0.select {
          ($0.testValue, $0.otherState?.name)
        }
      }
      ```

  - For any store state that is `Equatable` or any sub-selected state that is `Equatable`, `skipRepeats` will be used by default.

  - For states/substates that are not `Equatable`, `skipRepeats` can be implemented via a closure:

    ```swift
    store.subscribe(subscriber) {
      $0.select {
          $0.testValue
          }.skipRepeats {
              return $0 == $1
          }
    }
    ```

- Reducer type has been removed in favor of reducer function (#177) - Ben-G

  - Here's an example of a new app reducer, for details see the README:

    ```swift
    func counterReducer(action: Action, state: AppState?) -> AppState {
        var state = state ?? AppState()

        switch action {
        case _ as CounterActionIncrease:
            state.counter += 1
        case _ as CounterActionDecrease:
            state.counter -= 1
        default:
            break
        }

        return state
    }
    ```

- `dispatch` functions now return `Void` instead of `Any` (#187) - @Qata

  - The return type has been removed without any replacement, since the core team did not find any use cases of it. A common usage of the return type in redux is returning a promise that is fullfilled when a dispatched action is processed. While it's generally discouraged to disrupt the unidirectional data flow using this mechanism we do provide a `dispatch` overload that takes a `callback` argument and serves this purpose.

- Make `dispatch` argument in middleware non-optional (#225) -  @dimazen, @mjarvis, @Ben-G

- `Middleware` now has a generic type parameter that is used for the `getState` method and matches the Store's `State` type. This allows accessing the state in middleware code without type casting (#226) - @mjarvis


**Other:**

- Extend `StoreType` with substate selector subscription (#192) - @mjarvis
- Add `DispatchingStoreType` protocol for testing (#197) - @mjarvis
- Installation guide for Swift Package Manager - @thomaspaulmann
