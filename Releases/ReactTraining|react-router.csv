This release removes all the deprecation warnings from `v2.x` along with some bugfixes.

While the focus of this project is shifting towards the component-based `v4`, _this branch will be maintained indefinitely!_

Bug fixes will continue to be accepted. We are not going to leave anyone hanging and want to assure you that `v3` development will be alive and well.

I've swapped out the version string to better represent the prerelease nature of the `v4` branch currently. It may not have been obvious before, but according to [semver](http://semver.org/), any version string with a `-anything` on the end is considered a prerelease version. I've seen some references to the versions before as 4.0.1 and 4.0.2. This isn't correct, as we haven't yet pushed a 4.0.0 final version. **This is not production-ready code. We're not done building 4.0!** 

And, most importantly, we need your help to figure out things that are missing, either stuff that should go into the core of React Router or external libraries and code patterns that need to be established. React Router is now a building block as much as React itself is, and this more lean, mean, super-minimal core means that you can build a lot of interesting stuff on top of it. Now's a great time to get into open source and contribute some code. Keep those issues and PRs coming!

~~**Also, for the love of god, _yes_, we know the docs site isn't scrollable.** We'll push a new version soon!~~

Use this link for the docs site from now on: https://react-router.now.sh/ We'll keep it updated.

Available on npm: `npm install react-router@next`

This is a ground-up rewrite of React Router that @ryanflorence and @mjackson have been working on for the last few months (with a tiny bit of help from yours truly). The central thesis for this version is ""declarative everything"". Almost all imperative code is completely gone in 4.0. 

The API is not only completely different, so is the way of thinking about routing in general. Async behaviors are gone, replaced by always rendering something (even if that's just a ""Loading..."" screen). There are no top-level route configuration, as you can ""route"" from anywhere in your component tree (but that doesn't keep you from creating your own route config).

We are working on an migration strategy that will allow you to run both version in tandem and update your routes incrementally.

Many of these familiar concepts are removed because they are best implemented from outside the router. v4 is much smaller in scope and code size, which is intentional. These, now external, features will eventually be implement as addon libraries, either provided officially or from the community. 

As expected, there will be growing pains. And bugs. And Twitter flame wars 💦🔥. But this is a declarative, composable approach to routing that fits the declarative, composable model of React. Please let us know where it is not 100% awesome with issues and pull requests.

### Quick Update:

Yes, there will still be a 3.0 release (soon!). It is simply v2.0 without any deprecation warnings. We intend to keep supporting the 3.x branch indefinitely (published separately on npm to aid in migration), although there will likely not be any future major versions based on that code. 4.0 is the future, but we won't leave you hanging if you want to stick with 2.x/3.x.

### Goals

You might enjoy reading this issue: https://github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/2646
1. Clear up the coupling between History and Router with simpler APIs.
2. Provide cleaner integrations with other libraries like Redux, Relay, Async Props etc.
3. Stop providing API that conceals usage of `context`. It is now a documented feature of React so developers using Router can implement their own opinions on how best to use context: Mixins, higher-order components, decorators, etc. React Router no longer has an opinion, but instead uses the lowest level feature of React.  This project wants to be an incredibly useful routing library and doesn't want to get hung up on best-practice patterns for getting stuff from up top to down low.
4. Draw a clean line between what goes to Route Components as `props` and what goes on `context`.

For a lot of apps this upgrade might look like API churn. Underneath the hood there are significant differences that make integrating with the rest of the React ecosystem more straightforward. Thanks for your continued patience and support as we all build this tool together. It's hard to imagine the top-level API changing much after this. But if it does, rest assured we are committed to ...

### Backwards Compatibility and Deprecation Warnings

This has been a community project from the start, we need your help making the upgrade as smooth as possible for everybody!

We have done our best to provide backwards compatibility with deprecated APIs. If you drop in v2.x into a v1.x application and it doesn't run, then there is a bug. Please open an issue when you discover what the problem is so we can get a fix out.

The deprecation warnings should also lead you to the relevant part of this document. If one doesn't, please open a pull request with a fix. Also, if any part of this document could be improved, please let us know how. Confound it, our bias is often inescapable!

### Upgrade Automatically with Codemods

Using a tool called [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), we have made available some codemods for upgrading your code to the new APIs automatically: https://github.com/rackt/rackt-codemod

A codemod is much like Babel, but instead of converting your ES2015 code to ES5 compatible syntax, it does a limited set of transformations on function names, arguments, common patterns and more. One way to think of jscodeshift (the underlying tool) is ""jQuery for code"". These codemods aren't bulletproof, so be sure to test your code after you run them. But they can help with upgrading a large codebase to remove deprecation warnings you're now triggering.

2103207,2015-11-09T21:52:52Z,2015-11-10T17:17:21Z,v1.0.0,"Thanks for your patience :) Big changes from v0.13.x to 1.0. While on the surface a lot of this just looks like shuffling around API, the entire codebase has been rewritten to handle some really great use cases, like loading routes and components on demand, session-based route matching, server rendering, integration with libs like redux and relay, and lots more.

But for now, here's how to translate the old API to the new one.

### Importing

The new `Router` component is a property of the top-level module.

``` js
// v0.13.x
var Router = require('react-router');
var Route = Router.Route;

// v1.0
var ReactRouter = require('react-router');
var Router = ReactRouter.Router;
var Route = ReactRouter.Route;

// or using ES Modules
import { Router, Route } from 'react-router';
```

### Rendering

``` js
// v0.13.x
Router.run(routes, (Handler) => {
  render(<Handler/>, el);
})

// v1.0
render(<Router>{routes}</Router>, el)

// looks more like this:
render((
  <Router>
    <Route path=""/"" component={App}/>
  </Router>
), el);

// or if you'd rather
render(<Router routes={routes}/>, el)
```

### Locations

Locations are now called histories (that emit locations). You import them from the [`history` package](https://github.com/rackt/history), not react router.

``` js
// v0.13.x
Router.run(routes, Router.BrowserHistory, (Handler) => {
  render(<Handler/>, el);
})

// v1.0
import createBrowserHistory from 'history/lib/createBrowserHistory'
let history = createBrowserHistory()
render(<Router history={history}>{routes}</Router>, el)
```

If you do not specify a history type (as in the example above) then you will notice some unusual behavior after updating to 1.0.0. With the default hash based routing a querystring entry not defined by yourself will start appearing in your URLs called `_k`. An example of how it looks is this: `?_k=umhx1s`

This is intended and part of [createHashHistory](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/basics/Histories.md#createhashhistory) (which is the default history approach used if one is not specified). You can read more about the feature [here](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/basics/Histories.md#what-is-that-_kckuvup-junk-in-the-url) and how to opt out [here](https://rackt.github.io/history/stable/HashHistoryCaveats.html).

### Route Config

You can still nest your routes as before, paths are inherited from parents just like before but prop names have changed.

``` js
// v0.13.x
<Route name=""about"" handler={About}/>

// v1.0
<Route path=""about"" component={About}/>
```

Named routes are gone (for now, [see discussion](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/1840))

### NotFound route

Not found really confused people, mistaking not finding resources from your API for not matching a route. We've removed it completely since it's simple with a `*` path.

``` js
// v0.13.x
<NotFoundRoute handler={NoMatch}/>

// v1.0
<Route path=""*"" component={NoMatch}/>
```

### Redirect route

``` js
// v0.13.x
<Redirect from=""some/where/:id"" to=""somewhere/else/:id"" params={{id: 2}}/>

// v1.0
// Works the same as before, except no params, just put them in the path
<Redirect from=""/some/where/:id"" to=""/somewhere/else/2""/>
```

### Links

#### path / params

``` js
// v0.13.x
<Link to=""user"" params={{userId: user.id}}>Mateusz</Link>

// v1.0
// because named routes are gone, link to full paths, you no longer need
// to know the names of the parameters, and string templates are quite
// nice. Note that `query` has not changed.
<Link to={`/users/${user.id}`}>Mateusz</Link>
```

#### ""active"" class

In 0.13.x links added the ""active"" class by default which you could override with `activeClassName`, or provide `activeStyle`s. It's usually just a handful of navigation links that need this behavior.

Links no longer add the ""active"" class by default (its expensive and usually not necessary), you opt-in by providing one; if no `activeClassName` or `activeStyle`s are provided, the link will not check if it's active.

``` js
// v0.13.x
<Link to=""about"">About</Link>

// v1.0
<Link to=""/about"" activeClassName=""active"">About</Link>
```

#### Linking to Index routes

Because named routes are gone, a link to `/` with an index route at `/` will always be active. So we've introduced `IndexLink` that is only active when on exactly that path.

``` js
// v0.13.x
// with this route config
<Route path=""/"" handler={App}>
  <DefaultRoute name=""home"" handler={Home}/>
  <Route name=""about"" handler={About}/>
</Route>

// will be active only when home is active, not when about is active
<Link to=""home"">Home</Link>

// v1.0
<Route path=""/"" component={App}>
  <IndexRoute component={Home}/>
  <Route path=""about"" component={About}/>
</Route>

// will be active only when home is active, not when about is active
<IndexLink to=""/"">Home</IndexLink>
```

This gives you more granular control of what causes a link to be active or not when there is an index route involved.

#### onClick handler

For consistency with React v0.14, returning `false` from a `Link`'s `onClick` handler no longer prevents the transition. To prevent the transition, call `e.preventDefault()` instead.

### RouteHandler

`RouteHandler` is gone. `Router` now automatically populates `this.props.children` of your components based on the active route.

``` js
// v0.13.x
<RouteHandler/>
<RouteHandler someExtraProp={something}/>

// v1.0
{this.props.children}
{React.cloneElement(this.props.children, {someExtraProp: something})}
```

**Note:** React does not validate `propTypes` that are specified via `cloneElement` (see: [facebook/react#4494](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4494#issuecomment-125068868)). It is recommended to make such `propTypes` optional.

### Navigation Mixin

If you were using the `Navigation` mixin, use the `History` mixin instead.

``` js
// v0.13.x
var Assignment = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ Navigation ],
  navigateAfterSomethingHappened () {
    this.transitionTo('/users', { userId: user.id }, query);
    // this.replaceWith('/users', { userId: user.id }, query);
  }
})

// v1.0
var Assignment = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ History ],
  navigateAfterSomethingHappened () {
    // the router is now built on rackt/history, and it is a first class
    // API in the router for navigating
    this.history.pushState(null, `/users/${user.id}`, query);
    // this.history.replaceState(null, `/users/${user.id}`, query);
  }
})
```

The following `Navigation` methods are now also found on the history object, main difference again is there are no params or route names, just pathnames.

| v0.13 | v1.0 |
| --- | --- |
| `go(n)` | `go(n)` |
| `goBack()` | `goBack()` |
| `goForward()` | `goForward()` |
| `makeHref(routeName, params, query)` | `createHref(pathname, query)` |
| `makePath(routeName, params, query)` | `createPath(pathname, query)` |

### State mixin

``` js
// v0.13.x
var Assignment = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ State ],
  foo () {
    this.getPath()
    this.getParams()
    // etc...
  }
})

// v1.0
// if you are a route component...
<Route component={Assignment} />

var Assignment = React.createClass({
  foo () {
    this.props.location // contains path information
    this.props.params // contains params
    this.props.history.isActive
  }
})

// if you're not a route component, you need to pass location down the
// tree or get the location from context. We will probably provide a
// higher order component that will do this for you but haven't yet.
// see further down for more information on what can be passed down
// via context
var Assignment = React.createClass({
  contextTypes: {
    location: React.PropTypes.object
  },
  foo () {
    this.context.location
  }
})
```

Here's a table of where you used to get stuff with the `State` mixin, and where you get it now if you're a route component (`this.props`)

| v0.13 (this) | v1.0 (this.props) |
| --- | --- |
| `getPath()` | `location.pathname+location.search` |
| `getPathname()` | `location.pathname` |
| `getParams()` | `params` |
| `getQuery()` | `location.search` |
| `getQueryParams()` | `location.query` |
| `getRoutes()` | `routes` |
| `isActive(to, params, query)` | `history.isActive(pathname, query, onlyActiveOnIndex)` |

Here is another table of properties you used to get via the `State` and where you can get it now if you are **not** a route component (`this.context`).

| v0.13 (this) | v1.0 (this.context) |
| --- | --- |
| `getPath()` | `location.pathname+location.search` |
| `getPathname()` | `location.pathname` |
| `getQuery()` | `location.search` |
| `getQueryParams()` | `location.query` |
| `isActive(to, params, query)` | `history.isActive(pathname, query, indexOnly)` |

Note not all `State` functionality can be accessed via context in v1.0. For example, `params` is not available via context.

We're developing scroll behaviors separately in the [`scroll-behavior`](https://github.com/rackt/scroll-behavior) library until we have a stable, robust implementation that we're happy with. Currently, scroll behaviors are exposed there as history enhancers: 

``` js
import createHistory from 'history/lib/createBrowserHistory'
import useScroll from 'scroll-behavior/lib/useStandardScroll'

const history = useScroll(createHistory)()
```

### `willTransitionTo` and `willTransitionFrom`

Routes now define this behavior:

``` js
// v0.13.x
var Home = React.createClass({
  statics: {
    willTransitionTo (transition, params, query, callback) { }
    willTransitionFrom (component, transition, params, query, callback) { }
  }
})

// v1.0
<Route
  component={Home}
  onEnter={(location, replaceWith) => {}}
  onLeave={() => {}}
/>
```

To cancel a ""transition from"", please refer to the [Confirming Navigation](docs/guides/advanced/ConfirmingNavigation.md) guide.

2103169,2015-03-20T21:25:43Z,2015-11-10T17:12:14Z,v0.13.0,"React introduced the ability to use ES6 classes for component definitions, which has the side-effect of mixins not being ""the thing"" anymore. Our mixins like `State` and `Navigation` just proxied calls to some methods on an undocumented feature of React called `context`, that in turn called methods on the router instance under the hood.

Without mixins we needed a way for you to get access to these methods. We decided the simplest solution was to stop hiding the router instance and just put the whole thing on context.

You can think about context as values that are floating around a render tree that parent components (`Handler` in the `Router.run` callback) can explicitly define and descendent components can explicitly ask for. The stuff on context doesn't show up in a component unless you ask for it.

**Note:** You can still use our mixins, you'll just get a deprecation warning.

``` js
// 0.12.x
var Foo = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ Router.State ],
  render: function () {
    var id = this.getParams().id;
    var searchTerm = this.getQuery().searchTerm;
    // etc. ...
  }
});

// 0.13.x w/o ES6 fanciness
var Foo = React.createClass({
  contextTypes: {
    router: React.PropTypes.func
  },

  render: function () {
    var router = this.context.router;
    var id = router.getCurrentParams().id;
    var searchTerm = router.getCurrentQuery().searchTerm;
    // etc.
  }
});

// 0.13.x w/ ES6 fanciness
class Foo extends React.Component {
  render () {
    var { router } = this.context;
    var id = router.getCurrentParams().id;
    var searchTerm = router.getCurrentQuery().searchTerm;
    // etc.
  }
}

Foo.contextTypes = {
  router: React.PropTypes.func
};
```

Most of the time we prefer to just pass the state down the props tree
and not mess with context:

``` js
Router.run(routes, (Handler, state) => {
  React.render(<Handler {...state}/>, document.body);
});

// and then when rendering route handlers, keep passing it down
<RouteHandler {...this.props}/>

// and then in your methods you have what you need on props
var id = this.props.params.id;
var searchTerm = this.props.query.searchTerm;
```

2103134,2014-11-22T06:03:21Z,2015-11-10T17:08:56Z,v0.11.0,"The router changed **a lot** in this release. While you won't have to change too much of your app, you will have to change it in a lot of places. The fundamental change is that you, rather than the router, get to have control of your view instances.

If you find anything is missing from this list, please open an issue and we will get it added here ASAP.

### React 0.12

You must upgrade to `0.12.x` before you can use version `0.11.x` of the
router.

### `<Routes/>` and starting the router

`<Routes/>` is gone, there is a new API that gives you complete control
of your views.

``` js
// 0.10.x
var routes = (
  <Routes location=""history"">
    <Route handler={App}>
      <Route name=""dashboard"" handler={Dashboard}/>
    </Route>
  </Routes>
);

React.render(routes, el);

// 0.11.x
var routes = (
  <Route handler={App}>
    <Route name=""dashboard"" handler={Dashboard}/>
  </Route>
);

Router.run(routes, Router.HistoryLocation, function (Handler) {
  React.render(<Handler/>, el);
});

// or default to hash location
Router.run(routes, function (Handler) {
  React.render(<Handler/>, el);
});
```

### `this.props.activeRouteHandler()` -> `<RouteHandler/>`

``` js
// 0.10.x
var Something = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      <div>
        <this.props.activeRouteHandler />
      </div>
    );
  }
});

// 0.11.x
var RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler;

var Something = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      <div>
        <RouteHandler />
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```

### `this.props.params` and `this.props.query`

They are no longer available on props, use the `State` mixin.

``` js
// 0.10.x
var Something = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    var name = this.props.params.name;
    var something = this.props.query.something;
    // ...
  }
});

// 0.11.x

// pass it down the view hierarchy to get the same lifecycle hooks to
// trigger as before
Router.run(routes, function (Handler, state) {
  React.render(<Handler params={state.params} query={state.query} />, el);
  // make sure to `<RouteHandler {...this.props}/>` to continue
  // passing it down the hierarchy
});

// or use the `State` mixin
var Something = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ Router.State ],
  render: function () {
    var name = this.getParams().name;
    var something = this.getQuery().something;
    // ...
  }
});

// Also, if you're using a flux-style app, you can trigger a ""transition""
// action in the `run` callback with the params/query in the payload, then
// subscribe in your handlers to the store that grabs the data.
```

### `ActiveState` -> `State`, and methods too

This mixin's name has changed, and all of its methods that had the word
`active` in it, too. For example, `getActiveParams()` becomes `getParams()`.

``` js
// v0.10.x
var Something = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ Router.ActiveState ],
  render: function () {
    var name = this.getActiveParams().name;
    // ...
  }
});

// v0.11.x
var Something = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ Router.State ]
  render: function () {
    var name = this.getParams().name;
    // ...
  }
});
```

### `CurrentPath` -> `State`

You can find `this.getPath()` on the `Router.State` mixin.

``` js
// v0.10.x
var Something = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ Router.CurrentPath ],
  render: function () {
    var path = this.getCurrentPath();
    // ...
  }
});

// v0.11.x
var Something = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ Router.State ],
  render: function () {
    var path = this.getPath();
    // ...
  }
});
```

### Route `addHandlerKey` prop

This option has been removed, you will need to add handler keys
yourself:

``` js
// 0.10.x
<Route handler={App}>
  <Route addHandlerKey={true}/>
</Route>

// 0.11.x
var App = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ Router.State ],

  getHandlerKey: function () {
    // this will all depend on your needs, but here's a typical
    // scenario that's pretty much what the old prop did
    var childDepth = 1; // have to know your depth
    var childName = this.getRoutes()[childDepth].name;
    var id = this.getParams().id;
    var key = childName+id;
    return key;
  },

  render: function () {
    return (
      <div>
        <RouteHandler key={this.getHandlerKey()} />
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```

### `<Routes onError={fn}/>`

`<Routes/>` is gone, instead create a router with your error handler as
an option:

``` js
// 0.10.x
<Routes onError={fn}>
  // ...
</Routes>

// 0.11.x
var router = Router.create({
  onError: fn,
  // ...
});
router.run(callback);
```

### `Router.renderRoutesTo*`

These methods have been removed because you, not the router, are in
control of rendering.

``` js
// v0.10.x
Router.renderRoutesToString(routes, path, function (html) {
 // do something with `html`
});

// v0.11.x
Router.run(routes, path, function (Handler) {
  var html = React.renderToString(<Handler/>);
});
```

### Route Props Passed to Handlers

In `0.10.x` you could add props to your route that would make their way
down to your handlers. While convenient, conflating routes with their
handlers was confusing to a lot of folks.

To get the same effect, you can either create your handlers with a
function and close over the information you need, or simply define those
properties on your handlers.

``` js
// 0.10.x
<Route name=""users"" foo=""bar"" handler={Something}/>

var Something = React.createClass({
  render () {
    return <div>{this.props.name} {this.props.foo}</div>
  }
});

// 0.11.x

// close over technique
<Route name=""users"" handler={makeSomething(""users"", ""bar"")}/>

function makeSomething(name, foo) {
  return React.createClass({
    render () {
      return <div>{name} {foo}</div>
    }
  });
}

// handler definition technique
<Route name=""users"" handler={Something}/>

var Something = React.createClass({
  foo: ""bar"",
  name: ""users"",
  render () {
    return <div>{this.name} {this.foo}</div>
  }
});

2103072,2014-10-06T19:37:27Z,2015-11-10T17:04:02Z,v0.9.0,"### `ActiveState` mixin `isActive`

`isActive` is now an instance method.

``` js
// 0.7.x
var SomethingActive = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ActiveState],

  render: function () {
    var isActive = SomethingActive.isActive(...);
  }
});

// 0.9.x
var SomethingActive = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ActiveState],

  render: function () {
    var isActive = this.isActive(...);
  }
});
```

### `<Routes onActiveStateChange/>` -> `<Routes onChange />`

``` js
// 0.7.x
<Routes onActiveStateChange={fn} />

function fn(nextState) {}

// 0.9.x
<Routes onChange={fn} />

function fn() {
  // no arguments
  // `this` is the routes instance
  // here are some useful methods to get at the data you probably need
  this.getCurrentPath();
  this.getActiveRoutes();
  this.getActiveParams();
  this.getActiveQuery();
}
```

### `.` in params support

`.` used to be a delimiter like `/`, but now its a valid character in
your params.

### `transition.retry()`

`transition.retry()` used to use `transitionTo`, creating a new history
entry, it now uses `replaceWith`.

``` js
// 0.7.x
React.createClass({
  login: function () {
    // ...
    transition.retry();
  }
});

// 0.9.x
React.createClass({
  mixins: [Navigation],
  login: function () {
    // ...
    this.transitionTo(transition.path);
  }
});
```

### Returning promises from transition hooks

Transition hooks are now sync, unless you opt-in to async with
`transition.wait(promise)`.

``` js
// 0.7.x
React.createClass({
  statics: {
    willTransitionTo: function (transition) {
      return somePromise();
    }
  }
});

// 0.9.x
React.createClass({
  statics: {
    willTransitionTo: function (transition) {
      transition.wait(somePromise());
    }
  }
});
```

### `preserveScrollPosition` -> `scrollBehavior`

`preserveScrollPosition` was totally broken and should have been named
`perverseScrollPosition`.

There are now three scroll behaviors you can use:
- `'browser'`
- `'scrollToTop'`
- `'none'`

`browser` is the default, and imitates what browsers do in a typical
page reload scenario (preserves scroll positions when using the back
button, scrolls up when you come to a new page, etc.) Also, you can no
longer specify scroll behavior per `<Route/>` anymore, only `<Routes/>`

```
<Routes scrollBehavior=""scrollToTop""/>
```

### RouteStore

This was not a public module, but we know some people were using it.
It's gone now. We have made getting at the current routes incredibly
convenient now with additions to the `ActiveState` mixin.

### `Router.transitionTo, replaceWith, goBack`

These methods have been moved to mixins.

``` js
var Router = require('react-router');

// 0.7.x
React.createClass({
  whenever: function () {
    Router.transitionTo('something');
    Router.replaceWith('something');
    Router.goBack();
  }
});

// 0.9.x
var Navigation = Router.Navigation;

React.createClass({
  mixins: [Navigation],
  whenever: function () {
    this.transitionTo('something');
    this.replaceWith('something');
    this.goBack();
  }
});
```

### `<Routes onTransitionError onAbortedTransition/>`

These were removed, there is no upgrade path in `0.9.0` but we will have
something soon. These weren't intended to be used.

### `ActiveState` lifecycle method `updateActiveState` removed

We didn't actually need this. Just use `this.isActive(to, params,
query)`.

### `AsyncState` mixin removed

There is no upgrade path. Just use `comoponentDidMount` to request
state. This was some groundwork for server-side rendering but we are
going a different direction now (using props passed in to route
handlers) so we've removed it.

2103061,2014-08-29T20:58:36Z,2015-11-10T17:01:46Z,,"### Path Matching

Paths that start with `/` are absolute and work exactly as they used to.
Paths that don't start with `/` are now relative, meaning they extend
their parent route.

Simply add `/` in front of all your paths to keep things working.

``` xml
<!-- 0.5.x -->
<Route path=""/foo"">
  <Route path=""bar""/>
</Route>

<!-- 0.6.x -->
<Route path=""/foo"">
  <Route path=""/bar""/>
</Route>
```

Though, you may want to embrace this new feature:

``` xml
<!-- 0.5.x -->
<Route path=""/course/:courseId"">
  <Route path=""/course/:courseId/assignments""/>
  <Route path=""/course/:courseId/announcements""/>
</Route>

<!-- 0.6.x -->
<Route path=""/course/:courseId"">
  <Route path=""assignments""/>
  <Route path=""announcements""/>
</Route>
```

Also `.` is no longer matched in dynamic segments.

``` xml
<!-- 0.5.x -->
<Route path=""/file/:filename"" />

<!-- 0.6.x -->
<Route path=""/file/:filename.?:ext?"" />

<!--
  or for a looser match to allow for multiple `.` note that the data
  will be available on `this.props.params.splat` instead of
  `this.props.params.filename`
-->
<Route path=""/file/*"" />
```

### Link params

Links should now pass their params in the `params` property, though the
old behavior will still work, you should update your code soon because
it will be removed by `v1.0`

``` js
// 0.5.x
<Link to=""user"" userId=""123""/>

// 0.6.x
<Link to=""user"" params={{userId: ""123""}}/>
```

### Dynamic Segments, keys, and lifecycle methods

If you have dynamic segments and are depending on `getInitialState`,
`componentWillMount`, or `componentDidMount` to fire between transitions
to the same route--like `users/123` and `users/456`--then you have two
options:
- add `addHandlerKey={true}` to your route and keep the previous
  behavior (but lose out on performance), or
- implement `componentWillReceiveProps`.

``` js
// 0.5.x
<Route handler={User} path=""/user/:userId""/>

// 0.6.x
<Route handler={User} path=""/user/:userId"" addHandlerKey={true} />

// 0.5.x
