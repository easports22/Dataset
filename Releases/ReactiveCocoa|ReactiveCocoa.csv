## ReactiveMapKit

1. MapKit reactive bindings have been moved to a new **ReactiveMapKit** framework. (#3524)

   Sources that use the MapKit bindings are now required to import ReactiveMapKit.

   For all Xcode project users (including Carthage), targets need to be configured to link against ReactiveMapKit. 

   For CocoaPods users, your Podfile needs to be updated too, since the framework is offered as a standalone pod.

   ```
   pod ""ReactiveMapKit"", ""7.0.0-alpha.1""
   ```

## Special Note on CocoaPods compatibility

As at October 2017, CocoaPods has yet to officially support projects with mixed Swift language modes.

[If you fail to build ReactiveCocoa with CocoaPods, you must apply a workaround to override `SWIFT_VERSION` of ReactiveCocoa as Swift 3.2](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/6791#issuecomment-333079766).

The core Swift APIs have been extracted to [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift), and ReactiveCocoa now depends on it. The old Objective-C APIs from RAC 2.x have been moved to [ReactiveObjC](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveObjC) and bridging code is available in [ReactiveObjCBridge](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveObjCBridge). You can read more about this in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

The new reactive bindings build on the excellent work done by @neilpa on [Rex](https://github.com/RACCommunity/Rex). AppKit and UIKit objects are extended via a `reactive` property that houses `Signal`s and `BindingTarget`s to be used with ReactiveSwift’s `<~` operator.

``` swift
class VM {
    let name: Property<String>
    let submit: Action<(), (), NoError>
}

class VC: UIViewController {
    let viewModel: VM
    let nameLabel: UILabel
    let submitButton: UIButton

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        // Update nameLabel's text whenever the VM's name changes
        nameLabel.reactive.text <~ vm.name

        // Execute the submit action whenever the button is tapped
        submitButton.reactive.pressed = CocoaAction(vm.submit)
    }
}
```

A more detailed explanation is available in the [README](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/master/README.md).

To learn more about the changes to core APIs, please refer to [ReactiveSwift 1.0](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/releases/tag/1.0.0). Extensive use of Swift’s @available declaration has been used to ease migration from ReactiveCocoa 4. Xcode should have fix-its for almost all changes from older APIs.

## New since alpha 6
1. Method call arguments can now be intercepted with `NSObject.reactive.signal(for:)`. Arguments are wrapped into an array of `NSNumber` and `NSValue`, which can be conveniently retrieved by exploiting the `NSNumber` and `NSValue` bridging since Swift 3.0.1. (#3302)

## Changed since alpha 6
1. Method call interception now fully interoperates with method swizzling and message forwarding. (#3302)
2. Method call interception now interoperates with other isa-swizzling frameworks with a certain caveats. Please refer to the [interoperability guarantees](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/pull/3302#issuecomment-269062819) listed in the pull request. (#3302)

## Introduction

Starting with 5.0, ReactiveCocoa primarily focuses on extending Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks in Swift, on the ground laid by [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/#readme).

If you are looking for the Objective-C API, please visit [ReactiveObjC](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveObjC/#readme).

#### Precautions
1. Please be aware that more breaking changes are expected.
2. Known issue: [UIKit leaks](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/issues/3251).

#### About CocoaPods

The support is expected to land very very soon.

## ~~Hello Again!~~

### Improved
1. APIs have been updated for Swift 3
2. No longer depends on ReactiveObjC.
3. A parameterized `DynamicProperty`, leveraging Objective-C `id` as `Any`.
4. A parameterized `CocoaAction` with its assumed sender type.

### Added
1. UIKit reactive extensions.
   1. Accessible via `.reactive`.
   2. Many UI components expose `BindingTarget`s for commonly written key paths.
   3. `UIControl` subclasses expose signals of user initiated changes.
   4. `UIControl` expose triggers for UI control events.
   5. Convenient `UIControl` binding APIs with `Action`s.
2. AppKit reactive extensions.
   1. Accessible via `.reactive`.
   2. Many UI components expose `BindingTarget`s for commonly written key paths.
   3. `NSControl` expose signals of user initiated changes for all variants of values.
   4. `NSControl` subclasses may expose specialised signals, e.g. `NSTextField.reactive.continuousStringValues`.
3. Foundation reactive extensions
   1. Accessible via `.reactive`.
   2. Intercepting selectors.
   3. Key path observations.
   4. Lifetime observations.

### Note

Many more changes since ReactiveCocoa 4! Future releases will aim to have more complete release notes.

---

### New Features
- Added `modify`, `swap`, and `withValue` to `MutableProperty` (#2617, thanks @andersio and @ikesyo and @NachoSoto for the review!).
- Added `signal` to `PropertyType` (#2543, #2622, thanks @andersio  and @NachoSoto for the review!).
- Added `Signal.empty`, equivalent to `SignalProducer.empty` (#2622, thanks @andersio  and @NachoSoto for the review!).
- Added a new operator: `SignalProducer.replayLazily`, for multicasting (#2639, thanks @NachoSoto and @JaviSoto, @aschuch, @jspahrsummers, @andymatuschak, @kastiglione, @mdiep, @liscio, and others for reviewing!).

### Improvements
- The `Disposable` protocol now requires types to be a `class` (#2641, thanks to @Adlai-Holler and @NachoSoto for the review!).
- **Breaking change**: removed default capacity from `SignalProducer.buffer()` and `SignalProducer.replayLazily()`. Users are now forced to explicitly decide what the capacity should be in each case (#2672, thanks @mdiep and @neilpa for the review!).

~~\* Added missing `UIKit` extensions to `tvOS` target (#2651, thanks @NachoSoto and @neilpa for the review!).~~. The headers were missing (#2673), so this will be in the next release.
