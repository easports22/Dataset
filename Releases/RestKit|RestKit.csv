We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of RestKit 0.20.3. This was a quick release that focused on fixing several high priority bugs and introduced several new feature enhancements in the network layer.

## Release Details

The full details of all features and fixes present in the release are available on Githubâ€¦

## Release Highlights

The 0.20.3 release contains a blend of bug fixes and feature enhancements. Highlights of the release include:
- Improvements to the `modificationAttribute` logic. A modification attribute can be designated on an `RKEntityMapping` to accelerate mapping of large payloads by intelligently detecting changes on a per object basis. [(Issue #1391)](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/issues/1391)
- Fixed memory leaks in `RKOperationStateMachine`. [(Issue #1404)](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/issues/1404)
- Added support for mapping the `@parent` and `@root` pseudo-key-paths. This enhancement provides for upward traversal of representations at mapping time, greatly enhancing mapping flexibility. Big thanks to @percysnoodle on this one. [(Issue #1435)](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/issues/1435)
- Added support for custom data source implementations in the network layer. [(Issue #1442)](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/issues/1442)
- Added support for using `RKRequestMethod` as a bitmask in routing. [(Issue #1476)](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/issues/1476)
- Added support for using `RKReqeustMethod` bitmask values in `RKRequestDescriptor` and `RKResponseDescriptor`. [(Issue #1482)](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/issues/1482)
- Added support for intelligently mapping additional objects in a payload by eliminating reliance on `targetObject` in `RKMapperOperation`. [(Issue #1309)](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/issues/1309)
