- Made `Constraint layoutConstraints` public again so you can publicly access the layout constraints. Use with caution as SnapKit expects ownership of these.
- Fixed bug with `contentCompressionResistanceHorizontalPriority` (#387)
- Fixed missing topMargin with `contentCompressionResistanceHorizontalPriority` (#393)
- Added more robust priority support (#345)

- You can now use a UILayoutGuide/NSLayoutGuide much like a UIView with the familiar `makeConstraints`, `remakeConstraints`, `updateConstraints`, and `removeConstraints` API.

- Adds `topMargin` back in to ConstraintMaker
- Adds `equalToSuperview()`, `lessThanOrEqualToSuperview()`, `greaterThanOrEqualToSuperview()`
- Doing `equalTo(CGPoint)` ensures superview + offset from top left.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed small memory leaks on all constraints #310 
- Fixed macOS bug preventing `make.edges.equalTo(other.snp.edges)` #309 
- Fixed bug preventing debug labels from being set. You must now use `setLabel()` #313

4177623,2016-09-14T09:50:40Z,2016-09-20T05:16:32Z,SnapKit 3.0.0 - Swift 3.0 Release,"**SnapKit 3.0** is a complete re-write to take advantage of modern Swift 3.0 as well as
clean up the API. As such please use with caution and check your apps thoroughly

### Breaking
- iOS 7.0 support has been removed
- `install` and `uninstall` have been deprecated, use `activate` and `deactivate` instead
- DSL is now accessed through `.snp.*` rather than `.snp_*`. For example `view.snp.makeConstraints { }`
- Constraints are now updated through `update(offset:)`, `update(inset:)` and `update(priority:)`
- `.inset()` will no longer take `CGPoint` or `CGSize` as input
- `.offset()` will no longer take `CGPoint`, `CGSize`, `EdgeInsets` as input
- `updateConstraints` will no longer allow creating new constraints unless there are no existing constraints for the view. If it does generate new constraints it will throw a fatal error.
- `UIEdgeInsets` are now have their right and bottom value inverted for more natural results such as `make.edges.equalTo(UIEdgeInsets(top: 10, left: 10, bottom: 10, right: 10)).inset()`

### Enhancements
- Debugging output has been improved to show exact file/line number from which the broken constraint was created
- Exceptions thrown during constraint creation have been replaced with `fatalError` with better output
- Constraints are now installed through `NSLayoutConstraint.activate` and what view they are added to is now deferred to UIKit
- Added `var contentHugging<Axis>Priority: CGFloat` to `make`
- Added `var contentCompressionResistance<Axis>Priority: CGFloat` to `make`
- Added support for `UILayoutGuide` via `make.left.equalTo(guide.snp.top)`
- Added support for constraining edges to margins or vice versa via `make.edges.equalTo(other.snp.margins)`
