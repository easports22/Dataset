### Releasify now disallows non-Semver versions

While using non-Semver versions in your NuGet package was always incorrect and resulted in undefined behavior, due to #868, these are now a full non-starter. We now require packages to have Semver-compatible versions names. Note that this doesn't affect your EXE versions, which can still use all four Win32 version numbers.

### Stub Executables (#868)

While Squirrel.Windows's approach of moving around executables and rewriting shortcuts is the key feature that enables background updates without rebooting / restarting, it also conflicts with Windows's View Of The World in a lot of annoying ways. Things like pinning, file associations, etc etc end up being tricky to handle with the current approach of using Update.exe as a trampoline.

Now, Squirrel will scan your package for executables and create a ""dummy"" copy of this executable - one with the same icon and version metadata, but will instead run a copy of the latest version of the Real version of the executable. Instead of shortcuts pointiing to Update.exe, it'll point to this executable.

Note that for the first release after you upgrade to 1.5.0, stub executables won't be copied in, since the update will be done by the previous version of Squirrel.Windows which is stub-unaware. The existing Update-based shortcuts will continue to work though.

### ToastActivatorCLSID (#879, thanks @felixrieseberg)

This PR allows you to use Windows 10 App Activation, which is required for features such as Win10 notification replies. A activator CLSID will be generated based on your app's NuGet package ID, which will be written out to the log. Implement your activator class using this GUID.

### MSI Packages are now upgradable (#658)

MSI packages in the past were a one-off way to install your package to an entire org via Group Policy. While your apps still auto-updated on existing machines, it was difficult to actually upgrade the MSI file itself, so it was hard to do a new rollout to new machines. Now, the identifiers in your package are based on your package ID.

### Machine Install is no more (#614)

Because Squirrel.Windows now generates MSI files, there is no need for the `--machine` parameter - MSI does everything that was supposed to do, only better. Squirrel also now refuses to run under elevated Admin even harder than it used to (i.e. if rerunning as non-UAC was unsuccessful, we will refuse to continue). This stops people from installing under permissions that later, we can't update to, which causes havoc.

### Machine-Wide Installs via MSI (#466)

Squirrel's Releasify command now generates an MSI file suitable for installation via Group Policy. This MSI isn't a general-purpose installer, it is designed to mimic the behavior of `--machine` (#337 for the lazy) - this means that once you run the MSI, users from now on will get the app installed, _on next Login_. 

So, most normal users should continue to run the Setup.exe's generated by Releasify, but if you want to have an IT Admin Friendly version, you can hand off the MSI

Most users of Squirrel won't have to do anything new to enable this behavior, though certain NuGet package IDs / names might cause problems with MSI. Generating MSIs can be disabled via the `--no-msi` flag.

### Resolve issue with tray icon preferences duplicating forever

This resolves an issue with Squirrel.Windows applications, where if you use `Shell_NotifyIcon` to show a tray icon, every update will put a new entry in the ""Always Show"" notification preferences. https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/2468#issuecomment-142684129 has the entire sad story on what's happening here.

This PR also exposes a new `TrayStateChanger.PromoteTrayItem` method, which will allow you to promote your tray icon to be always visible unless the user explicitly says ""Never show it ever"".

### Release Information (#428)

### Machine-Wide Installation

IT Administrators can now install Squirrel-based applications machine-wide, by passing in the `--machine` flag to Setup.exe

### Better Delta packaging

Delta packages in previous versions would often be unable to compress certain non-PE Image file types (most notably, Electron ASAR archives). The new version will successfully compress these using an alternative diffing method. Note that you must ship a ""Squirrel.exe"" in your NuGet package to get this benefit to existing installations (old versions will fall back to full archives for one release).

### Breaking Changes for 1.0

Several breaking changes have been made to the C# API in preparation for 1.0:
- The `FrameworkVersion` parameter is now dead, remove it anywhere you were using it (it didn't do anything anyways)
- Certain utility classes such as `ShellLink` are now moved into a `Squirrel.Shell` namespace
- Passing the `applicationName` parameter into the `UpdateManager` class is now optional, you should remove it.

### Installing to C:\ProgramData (#308)

In many corporate environments, installing to LocalAppData is blocked via Group Policy or other similarly dumb restrictions. To work around this, Squirrel will now first attempt to install to LocalAppData, and will fall back to `C:\ProgramData\USERNAME\APPNAME`. _This has consequences for your app!_ 

If your application currently is hard-coded to look in `%LocalAppData%` for stuff, this release will break you (well technically, these users were never able to install in the first place, but now they will be able to and now you're gonna see weirdness). Instead, use UpdateManager's `RootAppDirectory` property, or do all of your operations relative to `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location`.

This release also adds an `IsInstalledApp` property on UpdateManager which lets you tell if the application is currently installed.
