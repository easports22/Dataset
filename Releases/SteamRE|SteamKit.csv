8120019,2017-10-14T11:36:08Z,2017-10-14T11:50:50Z,SteamKit 2.0.0-Beta.1,"* SteamKit 2.0 now targets .NET Standard 2.0. This means it now requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher, .NET Core 2.0 or higher, or any other .NET Standard 2.0-compatible runtime.
* Added support for WebSocket client connections.
	* Server List treats WebSocket, TCP and UDP independently, even for the same server.
	* If a server is not reachable on TCP, SteamKit will still attempt UDP and vice-versa.
* Added `SteamConfiguration`, which replaces the previous assortment of individual configuration properties and parameters.
	* If the `SteamConfiguration` permits both TCP and UDP, both can now be used (depending on server ranking). (#417)
	* See the Breaking Changes section below for further details.
* Added `ArgumentNullException` to the public API surface when passing null into methods that would have previously triggered a `NullReferenceException`.
* Updated Protobuf message classes to expose a property indicating if any wire value was specified or not, and a method to clear the value.
* Updated game-related GC messages and protobufs. (#459, #460)
* Updated Steam enums and protobufs. (#456, #457, #458)
* Fixed no callback being fired when calling `SteamUserStats.GetLeaderboardEntries`. (#421)
* Fixed a crash if we encountered a message that's too small to actually contain a message.
* Fixed user's name being changed to `[unassigned]` if `SteamFriends.SetPersonaState()` is called too early. (#442)
* Fixed order of handlers being non-deterministic. (#442)
* Fixed exception when using `SteamUnifiedMessages.UnifiedService<>.SendMessage`. (#469)

BREAKING CHANGES

* Removed all methods and properties that were marked as `[Obsolete]`.
* The `SteamClient` constructor now accepts a `SteamConfiguration` object, which is a container for various configuration settings.
	* If you were using the `SteamClient` constructor to specify a specific protocol type (TCP or UDP), use `SteamConfiguration` instead.
	* If you were using various properties to modify timeouts etc., use `SteamConfiguration` instead.
	* If you do not provide a `SteamConfiguration` when constructing a `SteamClient`, the server list will be private to that `SteamClient` instance.
	* If you create multiple clients from a single configuration, the server list will be shared among those clients.
	* `SteamClient.ConnectedUniverse` is now `SteamClient.Universe`. This is now set from the configuration, and is no longer `EUniverse.Invalid` when not connected.
	* `SteamClient.ConnectionTimeout` is now read-only. Setting this property is now performed on `SteamConfiguration`.
* Removed `SteamClient.ConnectedCallback.EResult`, as it could only ever be `EResult.OK`.
* Servers are now represented by `ServerRecord` objects, not IP addresses.
	* `CMListCallback` now returns a collection of `ServerRecord` objects, not IP addresses. (#434)
	* `CMListCallback` now also includes WebSocket servers. (#434)
	* `SteamClient.Connect` now optionally accepts a `ServerRecord` instead of optionally accepting an `IPEndPoint`. You can create a `ServerRecord` for a particular protocol type or set of protocol types.
	* `IServerListProvider` now deals with `ServerRecord`s instead of `IPEndPoint`s.
* Disabling server list fetching from the directory is now done via `SteamConfiguration` instead of `SmartCMServerList`.
* `SteamDirectory` helper methods now accept a `SteamConfiguration` rather than just a cellid.
* `SteamFriends.GetPersonaName()`, `SteamFriends.GetFriendPersonaName` and `SteamFriends.GetClanName` can all now return null if the value is unknown. (#443)
* `WebAPI` used to throw a `WebException` on non-success status code, or other failure. It now throws `HttpRequestException`. (#446)
* `CDNClient` and `WebAPI` now expose `Task`-based asynchronous methods.

- Removed obsoleted `ICallbackMsg` extension methods `IsType<>` and `Handle<>`. (pr #221)
- Game Coordinator base messages are now generated per-game, instead of relying on Dota 2. GC messages should use the base messages for their game, which is separated by namespace. (pr #180)
- Cell IDs are now consistently `uint`s within `SteamDirectory`.
