#### Fixed

- Fix issue related to pixel misalignment for action buttons. (#50)
- Fix crash on iOS 10.0.0 where UIFeedbackGenerator crashed on non-haptic supported devices. (#51)
- Fix issue related to iOS 11. SwipeCellKit was inadvertently enabling/disabling various gestures on UITableView, including system level ones in hopes of disabling 3D Touch on swiped UITableViewCells. Developers must now handle the disabling/enabling of 3D touch when cell is swiped with the aid of `SwipeTableViewCellDelegate`.

#### Added

- Added highlighted background color for action button. (#52)

#### Fixed

- Correctly setting the parents project to support iOS 9.0+. (#40)
- Fix issue where using non-`SwipeTableViewCell` within a `UITableView` interfered with `didSelectRowAtIndexPath`. This was caused by the assumption all cells in a UITableView extend `SwipeTableViewCell`. (#37) (#43)
- Add protection against `superview` in `point(inside:)` being `nil` and crashing.

6102440,2017-04-17T22:42:44Z,2017-04-17T22:44:27Z,1.8.0,"#### Added

- New `targetOverscrollElasticity` property in `SwipeExpansionStyle` to support customization of elasticity when dragging past the expansion target. (#30)
- New `swipeOffset` property and `setSwipeOffset(_:animated:completion:)` in `SwipeTableViewCell` to support programmatically setting the swipe offset. (#19)
- Add support for relayout of action buttons if cell frame changes while swiped (ie. rotation/tableview resizing). Now that active/swiped `SwipeTableViewCells` no longer reset to center when the parent `UITableView` performs layout (#28), better support for `UITableView` frame/bounds changes are required.  The `UITableView` frame/bounds may change during rotation or whenever its parent view frame changes.  The `SwipeActionsView` was already using auto layout to resize appropriately, but its button (and wrapper) subviews were using constraints derived from the default autoresizingMask.  This change ensures the `SwipeActionButtonWrapperView` flexes with its parent `SwipeActionsView`, and button subviews pin to the appropriate left/right side of their wrapper view depending on orientation.

#### Fixed

- Fix issue where mask was not removed when using `.reset` style action fulfillment. (#27)
- Fix to adjust the cell's new frame origin `x` value when it's already active. This ensures a swiped cell is not reset to center whenever the `UITableView` performs layout on it's cell subviews.

- Fully customizable expansion styles. See README documentation for more details. (#14)
- `SwipeTableViewDelegate` delegate methods for `willBeginEditingRowAt` and `didEndEditingRowAt`. (#18)

#### Fixed

- Removed action view cleanup when cell moved moved off UIWindow. Initially, this was added to prevent retain cycles caused by `SwipeAction` handlers capturing `self`.  Instead, it should be left up to the implementor to use `[weak self]` in handler implementations or ensure the action view is hidden before dismissing/popping a temporary parent view controller.  I've verified this behaves the same way as `UITableViewRowAction`. (#23)
- Issue where the table view pan gesture was being disabled along with all other table view gestures when a cell was swiped. (#21)

- Issue where the destructive action animation relied on the table view to animate covering the deleted cell with the cells below it in order for its height to appear to shrink. If the cell being deleted was the last row, or the remaining cells below were not tall enough, the height of the deleted cell would not appear to shrink. Fixed by adding a mask to cell and animate its height to zero. (#15)
- Missing call to `super.didMoveToSuperview` causing accessory taps to be ignored. (#16)
- The previous action button `textColor` fix to re-add also setting the tint color to the text color. The tint color effects button images rendered as template images.

- Ability to programmatically show swipe actions. (#13)
- Support for action background effect. (#10)
