- **[Fixed]** Static files immediately result in a 404, because trying a filename with a trailing slash on the end is never going to result in a happier ending.  
- **[Fixed]** Incorrect preview link & icon position in the editor making it easier to preview your post by clicking the word ""preview"" at the bottom of the editor.  
- **[Fixed]** Requesting `url` as a field from the Posts API didn't return the correct response (Public API Beta).  
- **[Changed]** Trusted domains now require their protocol be included. See below for details (Public API Beta).
