- Added support for custom AO color.
- Added a NaN killer (enabled by default).
- Added an ""anamorphic"" setting to bloom.
- Added alpha-propagation to most effects to allow post-processing to render against a transparent background.
- Lens Dirt now keeps its aspect ratio.
- The package now automatically sets a global define (`UNITY_POST_PROCESSING_STACK_V2`) when it's imported (can be used to check if v2 is currently available in the project).
- Fixed various bugs and platform compatibility issues.
