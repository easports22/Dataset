5728140,2017-03-13T18:11:15Z,2017-03-13T18:25:41Z,VVV 2.0.0,"VVV 2.0.0 introduces **breaking changes** in how files are organized and introduces an entirely new method of configuration.

A full `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up` are recommended for best results. Running `vagrant destroy` will remove your virtual machine entirely and all data stored on the VM will be lost. Please be sure to backup your databases and any files stored in the VM. Files on your local file system will remain, but will still benefit (as always) from a backup.

It is possible to make the from VVV 1.4.x to 2.0.0 without a `vagrant destroy`, but the process will involve restructuring several things. Primarily, default project directories are now expected to contain a `public_html/` directory. This requires not only file changes, but new Nginx configurations. If you need help troubleshooting, don't hesitate to open a new issue.

Please see the [migration documentation](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/migrate-vvv-1/) for tips on how to manage this process.

The decision to include breaking changes in a release is not made lightly. The new ability to configure your installation of VVV with a `vvv-custom.yml` file will make VVV entirely more flexible and maintainable than it has ever been. Please see the [release blog post](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/blog/2017/03/13/varying-vagrant-vagrants-2-0-0.html) and [documentation](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/) for more details.

### Features & Enhancements

* Introduce a YAML configuration for VVV. It is now possible to customize your configuration of VVV with a `vvv-custom.yml` file that defines which projects, hosts, and utilities are provisioned. See [#980](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/980).
* Introduce a new [VVV Utilities repository](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities). This works with the new YAML configuration to provide the ability to customize what utilities are provisioned with VVV. See [#1021](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1021).
* Introduce a new [VVV Custom Site Template repository](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template). This can be used in `vvv-custom.yml` to quickly add new sites to VVV.
* Introduce a new [VVV WordPress Develop repository](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-develop). This is used in the default `vvv-config.yml` and can be used in (or excluded from) custom configurations.
* Introduce a new [VVV WordPress Default repository](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default). This is used in the default `vvv-config.yml` and can be used in (or excluded from) custom configurations.
* Introduce a new [VVV WordPress Trunk repository](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-trunk). This can be used in custom configurations if you'd like a checkout of WordPress trunk.
* Add support for custom keys in the YAML configuration. These are available to individual site provisioning scripts. See [#1071](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1071).
* Add support for PHP 5.6, 7.0, and 7.1 via the VVV YAML configuration. See [#1055](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1055).
* Introduce a new documentation structure and an entire set of new documentation. See [#1073](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1073) and, more importantly, [#1112](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1112).
* Introduce documentation explaining the governance of VVV. See [#1118](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1118).
* Install MariaDB 10.1 instead of MySQL 5.5 as part of default provisioning. See [#1005](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1005) and [#1115](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1115).
* Install and update WP-CLI with its PHAR file rather than with a git clone. See [#1057](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1057).
* Add the `php-memcached` package to default provisioning as an alternative to `php-memcache` that works with PHP 7.0. See [#1076](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1076).
* Set `colordiff` as the default `svn diff` command tool. See [#1077](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1077).
* Add a VVV logo to provisioning. See [#1110](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1110).
* Add some style to the default VVV dashboard. See [#1122](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1122).

### Bugs

* Remove old, unused `mu-plugins` directory. See [#1027](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1027).
* Follow redirects when detecting a network connection. See [#1048](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1048).
* Include `$is_args` with `try_files` in Nginx configuration. See [#1075](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1075).
* Remove an attempt to enforce `ipv4` in Postfix as it was not working. See [#1116](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1116).

## Bug fixes and enhancements
- Composer: Set a custom GitHub token for Composer if it exists. See [#575](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/575).
- Docs: Update inline `Vagrantfile` documentation to better explain various network configurations.
- MySQL: Enable `innodb_file_per_table`. See [#537](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/537).
- npm: Add `npm-check-updates` during provisioning to help manage `package.json` inside the VM. See [#484](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/484).
- PHP: Bump max upload size in PHP and Nginx to 1024MB to support developing on the Internet in the year 2016. See [#599](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/599).
- PHPCS: Set default code standards for PHPCS to WordPress-Core. See [#574](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/574).
- phpMyAdmin: Allow for a custom phpMyAdmin configuration file. See [#688](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/688).
- PHPUnit: Update PHPUnit to 4.8.x. A future update of VVV should include PHP 5.6.x or PHP 7 and allow us to update PHPUnit to 5.x. See [#808](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/808).
- PHPUnit: Allow PHPUnit to run tests from the local machine while using the WordPress unit tests database in the virtual machine. See [#785](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/785).
- PHPUnit: Set the `WP_CORE_DIR` path so PHPUnit tests are run against WordPress trunk. See [#783](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/783).
- Provision: Rewrite `provision.sh` to be more modular. This improves readability and may one day aid in testability. See [#659](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/659).
- Vagrant: Set the default box name to that of the working directory to allow for multiple instances of VVV without conflict. See [#706](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/706).
- Vagrant: Allow for a custom trigger, `vagrant_up` to fire during `vagrant up` and `vagrant reload`. See [#778](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/778).
- Vagrant: Make it easier and more forward-compatible to modify the virtual machine's IP address. See [#781](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/781).
- Vagrant: Clarify default setting of 1 CPU when creating the virtual machine. See [#625](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/625/).
- WordPress: Provide better support for testing with xip.io by accounting for these requests in `wp-config.php`. See [#559](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/559).
- WordPress: SVN repositories configured in VVV provisioning are now set to HTTPS. Existing repositories configured to HTTP will not automatically update during provisioning unless they are first relocated to HTTPS. The `svn relocate` command can be used for this. See [#561](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/561).
- WP-CLI: Add an external configuration for WP-CLI so that a locally installed copy can be used outside of the VM. See [#564](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/564).

Changes:
- VVV is now [MIT Licensed](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/master/LICENSE).
- **_Possible Breaking:**_ By default, database files are no longer mapped to a local location.
  - A full `vagrant destroy` and the removal of MySQL data from `{vvv-dir}/database/data/` is recommended.
  - If database files already exist from an earlier version of VVV, data will continue to be mapped locally until removed.
  - Database data will continue to exist on the virtual machine through `vagrant halt` and `vagrant suspend`.
  - Database data will no longer exist on the virtual machine after `vagrant destroy`.
  - A `db_backup` script is provided by default that creates local backups of each database on halt, suspend, and destroy if the vagrant-triggers plugin is installed.
- **_Possible Breaking:**_ Ubuntu has been upgraded from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS. We have also moved from 32bit to 64bit.
  - A full `vagrant destroy` is recommended for best results.
  - A new box will be downloaded for the base virtual machine. If you'd like to free space, remove the old box with `vagrant box remove precise32`. Running `vagrant box list` will show you all base VMs on your local machine.
  - With a new operating system comes a new RSA key. If you are connecting via SSH through an application that relies on your machines `known_hosts` file, you will need to clear the old key for 192.168.50.4. [See #365](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/365)
- Init scripts are now fired with `source` rather than `bash`. Due to this change, something like `cd ""$(dirname $0)""` no longer works as expected. See [#373](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/373) and [#370](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/370) for reasoning and discussion.
- WordPress: Add `develop_git` to convert the default SVN checkout to Git.
- PHP: Update to PHP 5.5.x
- PHP: Remove php-apc and apc.ini. Enable built in opcache.
- PHP: Start tracking custom php5-fpm.conf file.
- PHP: Start tracking custom opcache.ini file.
- PHP: Update to PHPUnit 4.0.x
- PHP: Install XDebug PECL extension directly, rather than via apt.
- phpMyAdmin: Update to 4.2.13.1
- WP-Cli: Add support for autocomplete.
- VVV Dashboard: Add [Opcache Status](https://github.com/rlerdorf/opcache-status) for opcache monitoring.
- Bash: Allow for a custom `bash_prompt` file in `config/`
- NodeJS: Use recommended PPAs to install
- NodeJS: Self update NPM during provisioning
- Logs: Map a shared directory for logs, start storing `php_errors.log`
- Nginx: Install using the mainline repository, currently 1.7.x.
