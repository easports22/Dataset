## Version 1.7.0 - 2015-08-20

### Added
-   Add Mongoid support for referenced/embedded relations. PR [#498](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/pull/498).
  
  _Penn Su_
-   Add German locale file (de.yml). PR [#537](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/pull/537).
  
  _Philipp Weissensteiner_

### Fixed
-   Fix [#499](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/issues/499) and [#549](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/issues/549). Ransack now loads only Active Record if both Active Record and Mongoid are running to avoid the two adapters overriding each other. This clarifies that Ransack currently knows how to work with only one database adapter active at a time. PR [#541](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/pull/541).
  
  _ASnow (Большов Андрей)_
-   Fix [#299](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/issues/299) `attribute_method?` parsing for attribute names containing `_and_` and `_or_`. Attributes named like `foo_and_bar` or `foo_or_bar` are recognized now instead of running failing checks for `foo` and `bar`. PR [#562](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/pull/562).
  
  _Ryohei Hoshi_
-   Fix a time-dependent test failure. When the database has `default_timezone = :local` (system time) and the `Time.zone` is set to elsewhere, then `Date.current` does not match what the query produces for the stored timestamps. Resolved by setting everything to UTC. PR [#561](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/pull/561).
  
  _Andrew Vit_
-   Avoid overwriting association conditions with default scope in Rails 3. When a model with default scope was associated with conditions (`has_many :x, conditions: ...`), the default scope would overwrite the association conditions. This patch ensures that both sources of conditions are applied. Avoid selecting records from joins that would normally be filtered out if they were selected from the base table. Only applies to Rails 3, as this issue was fixed since Rails 4. PR [#560](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/pull/560).
  
  _Andrew Vit_
-   Fix RSpec `its` method deprecation warning: ([c09aa17](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/commit/c09aa17)).
  
  _Jon Atack_
-   Fix deprecated RSpec syntax ([ba92a0b](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/commit/ba92a0b)).
  
  _Jon Atack_

### Changed
-   Upgrade gemspec dependencies: MySQL2 from '0.3.14' to '0.3.18', and RSpec from '~> 2.14.0' to '~> 2' which loads 2.99 ([000cd2](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/commit/000cd2)).
-   Upgrade spec suite to RSpec 3 `expect` syntax backward compatible with RSpec 2.9 ([87cd36d](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/commit/87cd36d) and [d296caa](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/commit/d296caa)).
-   FormHelper refactorings ([17dd97a](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/commit/17dd97a) and [29a73b9](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/commit/29a73b9)).

-   Upgrade Polyamorous dependency to version 1.2.0, which uses `Module#prepend` instead of `alias_method` for hooking into Active Record (with Ruby 2.x).
  
  _Jon Atack_

### Fixed
-   An improved fix for the ""undefined method `model_name` for Ransack::Search"" issue [#518](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/issues/518) affecting Rails 4.2.1 and 5.0.0. This fix allows us to remove the ActionView patch in Ransack version 1.6.4.
  
  _Gleb Mazovetskiy_
-   Fix an erroneous reference in `ActiveRecord::Associations::JoinDependency` to a version-dependent Active Record reference, and replace it with a better, more reliable one defined in Polyamorous. As this class lives inside an `ActiveRecord` module, the reference needs to be absolute in order to properly point to the AR class.

-   Make `search_form_for`'s default `:as` option respect the custom search key if it has been set ([PR #470](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/pull/470)). Prior to this change, if you set a custom `search_key` option in the Ransack initializer file, you'd have to also pass an `as: :whatever` option to all of the search forms. Fixes [#92](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/issues/92).
  
  _Robert Speicher_
-   Fix sorting on polymorphic associations due to missing downcase ([PR #467](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/pull/467)).
  
  _Eugen Neagoe_
-   Fix Rails 5 / Arel 5 compatibility after the Arel and Active Record API changed.
-   Fix and add tests for sort_link `default_order` parsing if the option is set as a string instead of symbol.
-   Fix and add a test to handle `nil` in options passed to sort_link.
-   Fix #search method name conflicts in the README.
  
  _Jon Atack_

### Changed
-   Refactor and DRY up FormHelper#SortLink. Encapsulate parsing into a Plain Old Ruby Object with few public methods and small, private functional methods. Limit mutations to explicit methods and mutate no ivars.
-   Numerous speed improvements by using more specific Ruby methods like:
  - `Hash#each_key` instead of `Hash#keys.each`
  - `#none?` instead of `select#empty?`
  - `#any?` instead of `#select` followed by `#any?`
  - `#flat_map` instead of `#flatten` followed by `#map`
  - `!include?` instead of `#none?`
-   Replace `string#freeze` instances with top level constants to reduce string allocations in Ruby < 2.1.
-   Remove unneeded `Ransack::` namespacing on most of the constants.
-   In enumerable methods, pass a symbol as an argument instead of a block.
-   Update Travis-ci for Rails 5.0.0 and 4-2-stable.
-   Update the Travis-ci tests and the Gemfile for Ruby 2.2.
-   Replace `#search` with `#ransack` class methods in the README and wiki code examples. Enabling the `#search` alias by default may possibly be deprecated in the next major release (Ransack v.2.0.0) to address [#369](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/issues/369).

  _Caleb Land_, _James u007_
-   Add tests for `lteq`, `lt`, `gteq` and `gt` predicates. They are also tested in Arel, but testing them in Ransack has proven useful to detect issues.
  
  _Jon Atack_
-   Add tests for unknown attribute names.
  
  _Joe Yates_
-   Add tests for attribute names containing `_or_` and `_and_`.

  _Jon Atack_, _Timo Schilling_
-   Add tests for `start`, `not_start`, `end` and `not_end` predicates, with emphasis on cases when attribute names end with `_start` and `_end`.
  
  _Jon Atack_

### Fixed
-   Fix a regression where form labels for attributes through a `belongs_to` association without a translation for the attribute in the locales file would cause a ""no implicit conversion of nil into Hash"" crash instead of falling back on the attribute name. Added test coverage.
  
  _John Dell_, _Jon Atack_, _jasdeepgosal_
-   Fix the `form_helper date_select` spec that was failing with Rails 4.2 and master.
  
  _Jon Atack_
-   Improve `attribute_method?` parsing for attribute names containing `_and_` and `_or_`. Attributes named like `foo_and_bar` or `foo_or_bar` are recognized now instead of running failing checks for `foo` and `bar`. 
  
  CORRECTION October 28, 2014: this feature is still not working -- to be fixed.
  
  _Joe Yates_
-   Improve `attribute_method?` parsing for attribute names ending with a predicate like `_start` and `_end`. For instance, a `foo_start` attribute is now recognized instead of raising a NoMethodError.
  
  _Timo Schilling_, _Jon Atack_

### Changed
-   Reduce object allocations and memory footprint (with a slight speed gain as well) by extracting commonly used strings into top level constants and replacing calls to `#try` methods with simple nil checking.

  _Andreas Philippi_
-   Add new documentation in the README explaining how to group queries by `OR`

-   Add new documentation in the README and in the source code comments
  explaining in detail how to handle whitelisting/authorization of
  attributes, associations, sorts and scopes.
-   Add new documentation in the README explaining in more detail how to use

### Fixed
-   Fix singular/plural Active Record attribute translations.
  
  _Andreas Philippi_
-   Fix the params hash being modified by `Search.new` and the Ransack scope.
  
  _Daniel Rikowski_
-   Apply default scope conditions for association joins (fix for Rails 3).
  
  Avoid selecting records from joins that would normally be filtered out
  if they were selected from the base table. Only applies to Rails 3, as
  this issue was fixed in Rails 4.
  
  _Andrew Vit_

  sometimes used `@q` and other times `@search`.

### Changed
-   Refactor Ransack::Translate.
-   Rewrite much of the Ransack README documentation, including the
  Associations section code examples and the Authorizations section detailing
