6519767,2017-05-26T20:29:39Z,2017-05-26T20:31:07Z,v2.13.1,"* Converted the **Firefox** version of Markdown Here to use the WebExtensions API. This makes MDH compatible with Firefox's new **multiprocess** architecture (aka **Electrolysis**). If you have an older version of MDH installed in Firefox, there will soon be a new release of that version which prompts you to install the new WebExtensions version.
  - The upgrade for existing Firefox users is a little rocky because the XUL version needs to continue to exist for Thunderbird (and Postbox) users. So the WebExtensions version has to fork.
  - The Firefox and Chrome code bases are now almost identical, so that's good.

* [Fixed bug# 369](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/369): Clicking Markdown Here's ""Options"" button in Firefox and Thunderbird (version 48+) causes the client application to hang. (Note that this only applies to the XUL version of the extension.)

  - Much thanks to Austin for his work polishing and tweaking the 60 variants of the logo. He did a lot of work getting things just right.
  - Thanks to everyone else who submitted a design: [Rafe Goldberg](http://rgd2.co/), [Jack Reis](http://www.ux-jack.com/), [Enrique Esquinas](https://twitter.com/esquinas), [Leon Wilmanns](http://leon-wilmanns.de/). All of their designs were great and I would have been happy for any of them to win.
  - Seriously, if you haven't seen the other designs, [go check them out](http://markdown-here.com/logo.html). And then check out their portfolios, bookmark them, and contact them the next time you need design work done.
  - Thanks to all of you who took the time to vote for the new logo.
  - If you are unhappy with the change to a monochrome browser toolbar and context menu button, [+1 this issue](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/302).
- [Fixed bug #297](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/297): Unrendering an email that is a reply to an email that was itself rendered with MDH would fail (if the original email were visible, like with Thunderbird or when it's expanded in Gmail).
  - Thanks to [Dave Tapley](https://github.com/dukedave) for creating a great video that illustrated the problem and how to reproduce it.
  - Repeatedly triggering this bug could also lead to the next bug...
- [Fixed bug #289](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/289): With forgot-to-render detection enabled, sending a large email could result in MDH causing the mail client to hang. 
  - Thanks to [r2evans](https://github.com/r2evans), [Dave Tapley](https://github.com/dukedave), and [Eugene Fryntov](https://github.com/efryntov) for reporting and helping to diagnose the problem. Also thanks to [georg](https://stackoverflow.com/users/989121/georg) on StackOverflow for helping me to [understand and improve](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31952381/end-of-string-regex-match-too-slow) the offending regex.
- [Fixed bug #283](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/283): Forgot-to-render detection was broken for Google Inbox. Thanks to [Marvin R.](https://github.com/therealmarv).
  - If you find that the forgot-to-render detection gets broken for the Gmail or Google Inbox web interfaces, please post to the [""markdown-here"" Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/markdown-here) or create [an issue in the Github project](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues). The MDH code that hooks into the webmail UI is brittle and might break when Google changes stuff.
- [Fixed bug #288](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/288): Some character combinations involving a dollar sign in inline code would render incorrectly. 
  - Thanks to [rfulkerson](https://github.com/rfulkerson) for reporting the problem.
