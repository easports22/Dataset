1. Removed `AlertDialogWrapper`. It was incompatible with new things in this release, and people should move away from it anyways. This library is more about fluidity and customization than it is backwards compatibility, at this point.
2. Completely removed support for `ListView` and `ListAdapter`. The entire library now uses `RecyclerView`, unless you use a custom view dialog. _Your custom adapters will now have to handle item click logic in their own since the `RecyclerView` class doesn't do it on its own._ RecyclerView is modern, and very fast; it's time to move.
3. _Checkbox prompts._ Add a simple checkbox to basic dialogs automatically, which mimics the look of a system permission dialog. See [CheckBox Prompts](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs#checkbox-prompts).
4. The `FolderChooserDialog` can now optionally allow users to create new folders while browsing. See [Folder Selector Dialogs](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs#folder-selector-dialogs).
5. Prefixed all view IDs with `md_` so they don't clash with view IDs in your own applications.

**Please check out the tutorial on the front page of this repository. There are various methods with different parameters now (and various methods that were removed altogether), especially the `.adapter()` method in the `Builder`. The `MaterialSimpleListAdapter` in _commons_ also has a new way of setting a click listener.**

2. Many, many fixes to all of the preference classes. If you use them, make sure you update! (if I were to go into detail, the amount of list items in these release notes would more than double)
3. If no preselected color is set in the `ColorChooserDialog`, it will default to the presets view rather than the custom view.

   - Its state is maintained correctly though device orientation changes.
   - The RGB labels are updated initially in the custom color chooser.
   - A cancel button is shown in the custom chooser too, not only the preset chooser.
2. Fixed an issue with permissions in the `FolderChooserDialog` below API 15.
3. Updated Proguard rules to avoid issues with progress dialogs.
4. Added `linkColor()` and associated variants to the dialog `Builder`. Added a `md_link_color` global theming attribute to go along with it.
5. Items accepts varargs of Strings in addition to arrays like before. E.g., you _can_ use `.items(""Hello"", ""Hi"", ""Hey"")` rather than `.items(new String[] { ""Hello"", ""Hi"", ""Hey"" })`.
6. Enabled JavaDoc generation for JitPack.
7. Other bug fixes and error avoidances.

2036845,2015-10-29T02:46:14Z,2015-10-29T02:41:47Z,0.8.5.0,"1. Added an alpha chooser to the `ColorChooserDialog` (in custom color selection, not for presets). It can be disabled with `allowUserColorInputAlpha(false)`.
2. Long pressing preset colors in the `ColorChooserDialog` will show the color hex in a tooltip.
3. Fixed a crash when `allowUserColorInput()` is set to false in a `ColorChooserDialog` in accent mode.
4. `inputRange()` annotations are fixed, passing -1 or 0 for the max length indicates no max length.
5. Fixed the RTL mode for the default Material preference layouts.
6. Added `getListView()` method to `MaterialListPreference`.
7. Fixed some issues with radio buttons having the wrong selection states in multi-select list dialogs.
8. If you set a custom layout to a Material preference from XML (using `android:layout`), your layout won't be overridden with this library's preference layout.
9. If you set a min length to an input dialog, but no max length, the counter label is hidden (so it doesn't display x/-1).

1. @plusCubed found and confirmed the news of AppCompat 23.1.0's dialogs now having proper limitations on their width for tablets, so we removed our own custom logic for that. This will help with consistency. Note that everything done in this library tries to very closely mimic what the design guidelines display, which even stock dialogs do not do the best.
2. Tweaked padding below the titles in list dialogs a little bit, there was too much before.
3. A default custom layout is used for the Material preferences in preference screens, so that the text lines up with the content inset of your Activities (where the back arrow is in your toolbar). Try out the sample to see this in action!
   - If you copied how the sample project displayed preferences before, you should remove the `android:layout` attribute from your preference XML and let them use Material Dialogs' improved version.
4. Google libs 23.1.0.
5. Updated the art in the README!

1948449,2015-10-12T19:42:02Z,2015-10-12T19:49:38Z,Release 0.8.3.0,"1. `colorControlHighlight` is used for the default button ripple color instead of `colorControlActivated`.
2. Renamed `itemColor(int)` to `itemsColor(int)`, along with the resource and attribute variations for consistency with other method names. The original ones will still work for a while, they're just marked as deprecated.
3. Added a new `itemsIds()` API (see [Assigning IDs to List Item Views](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs#assigning-ids-to-list-item-views)), which allows you to assign IDs to views in list dialogs.
4. Each `ColorChooserDialog` variant (primary, accent, or custom colors) use a different Fragment tag, so you can differentiate between them. Added a static `findVisible(Context, String)` method to `ColorChooserDialog` which allows you to retrieve a visible color chooser dialog (see [Finding Visible Dialogs](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs#finding-visible-dialogs)).
5. The `ColorChooserDialog` won't crash when using custom colors with no sub colors, only top level colors.
6. Added headers and organization to the sample project's UI, making it easier to explore what this library can do. ButterKnife is also used to avoid the need to manually set click listeners to all the buttons, further improving readability of the sample code.
7. Normal lists, single choice lists, and multi choice lists will look better when their items have multiple lines of text. Although it is discouraged from UX perspective.
8. `MaterialProgressBar` is now a Gradle dependency instead of integrating its classes into the library code to make it easier to keep them up to date. These classes are only supported and used above API 14.
9. Other fixes and tweaks throughout.

1914010,2015-10-12T19:41:28Z,2015-10-05T20:11:13Z,Release 0.8.2.0,"1. `ButtonCallback` has been deprecated. `MaterialDialog.Builder` now has `onPositive()`, `onNeutral()`, `onNegative()`, and `onAny()` methods that allow you to receive callbacks for all or specific action buttons. These methods all use an `interface` instead of an `abstract class` for the callback, so classes can now implement the interface.
2. Lots of improvements and fixes to `MaterialSimpleListAdapter` and `MaterialSimpleListItem`. There's some new features and the layouts were much improved. See the [Simple List Dialogs](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs#simple-list-dialogs) section in the README for details and examples.
3. The `ColorChooserDialog` now allows you to specify custom colors. See the [Color Chooser Dialogs](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs#color-chooser-dialogs) section in the README for details and examples.
4. The `MaterialEditTextPreference` will no longer receive two preference changed events when you press the positive action button.
5. The `FolderChooserDialog` now respects the value specified for the choose button in the `Builder`.
6. The library no longer forces the use of Support Library v23 in your apps, it will work with older versions.
7. Simplified the sample, especially `MainActivity`, using ButterKnife.

These rules prevent important library classes (progress drawable animators) from being removed when your app is built into an APK.
   - Drawables from [MaterialProgressBar](https://github.com/DreaminginCodeZH/MaterialProgressBar) have been used as of version 0.8.0.0. Thanks for the useful library, @DreaminginCodeZH!
2. Your app's `colorControlHighlight` theme attribute will now be respected, and it will be used as the default color for action button ripples on Lollipop and above.
   - In addition, a new `md_btn_ripple_color` global theming attribute was added to theme all `MaterialDialog`'s, along with a `buttonRippleColor(int)` method in `MaterialDialog$Builder`.
3. Moved `FolderChooserDialog` from the sample project into **commons**.
4. The README now has a [separate table of contents](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs#table-of-contents-commons) for **commons** components, including the `FolderChooserDialog`, `ColorChooserDialog`, and `MaterialSimpleListAdapter`.
   - The `FolderChooserDialog` requires the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission. On Android 6.0 Marshmallow, your app will need to request this permission. See the sample project for an example of how this is done.

Note that the transitive property is needed for the Gradle dependency:

``` Gradle
compile('com.afollestad.material-dialogs:core:0.8.1.0@aar') {
        transitive = true
}

Bintray is no longer used for this and future releases. I switched to JitPack.io since it's easier to use and more reliable. See the [Gradle Dependency](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs#gradle-dependency) section in the README for details.

### The Library Has Been Split Into Core and Commons

As explained in the [Gradle Dependency](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs#gradle-dependency) section, **the library has been split into two modules**. **Core** contains most of everything you probably used before, while **Commons** contains some extension classes such as the `ColorChooserDialog` and `Preference` classes.

### Other Fixes and Improvements
1. Fixed right-to-left layout support in the action buttons.
2. Custom progress drawables are used on Android 4.0 and above, they help guarantee consistency with progress dialogs across many Android versions and skins.
3. `inputMaxLength()` for input dialogs was deprecated, it was replaced with `inputRange()` which is detailed in the [Limiting Input Length](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs#limiting-input-length) section of the README.
4. Internal cleanup and organization.
5. Updated Google libs and Build Tools.
