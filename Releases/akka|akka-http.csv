-----
Notable changes:

## 10.0.7

### New Seed Templates for Akka HTTP Apps

We prepared new seed templates for starting out with Akka HTTP using the [Java DSL](https://github.com/akka/akka-http-java-seed.g8) as well as [Scala DSL](https://github.com/akka/akka-http-scala-seed.g8). By using the `sbt new` command one can now easily get a small sample project to easily get started with your first Akka HTTP app. More instructions on the seed template pages.

### New Path Directive `ignoreTrailingSlash`

Akka HTTP treats differently by default a route that ends with slash (`/`) than one that doesn't. From this version on, users who don't want to have this distinction, can use a new Path Directive called `ignoreTrailingSlash`. This route, will retry its inner route with and without a trailing slash. If you want to know more about this feature, please check the documentation pages for [Scala](scala/http/routing-dsl/directives/path-directives/ignoreTrailingSlash.md) and [Java](java/http/routing-dsl/directives/path-directives/ignoreTrailingSlash.md) API.

### List of Changes

#### Improvements

##### akka-http
 * Added new Path Directive `ignoreTrailingSlash` ([#880](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/880))
 * Prepared new seed templates for Akka HTTP apps (for both [Java DSL](https://github.com/akka/akka-http-java-seed.g8) and [Scala DSL](https://github.com/akka/akka-http-scala-seed.g8)) ([1137](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1137) & [1055](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1055))
 * Migrated to the new docs theme (same as Akka) ([#1129](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1129))
 * (ApiMayChange) `HttpApp#route` method was renamed to `routes` to highlight it is ""all the routes"" ([#953](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/953))

#### akka-http2-support
 * Synthetic Remote-Address header setting is now honored in HTTP2 server blueprint ([#1088](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1088))

#### Bug Fixes

##### General
 * OSGi Import-Package ranges have been fixed to allow Akka 2.5.x ([#1097](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1097))

##### akka-http-core
 * Dates in RFC1123 format with single-digit-day are now properly parsed ([#1110](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1110))
