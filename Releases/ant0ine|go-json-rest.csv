## What's New in v3
- Public Middlewares. (12 included in the package)
- A new App interface. (the router being the provided App)
- A new Api object that manages the Middlewares and the App.
- Optional and interchangeable App/router.

## Here is for instance the new minimal ""Hello World!""

``` go
api := rest.NewApi()
api.Use(rest.DefaultDevStack...)
api.SetApp(rest.AppSimple(func(w rest.ResponseWriter, r *rest.Request) {
        w.WriteJson(map[string]string{""Body"": ""Hello World!""})
}))
http.ListenAndServe("":8080"", api.MakeHandler())
```

_All 19 examples have been updated to use the new API. [See here](https://github.com/ant0ine/go-json-rest#examples)_

## Deprecating the ResourceHandler

V3 is about deprecating the ResourceHandler in favor of a new API that exposes the Middlewares. As a consequence, all the Middlewares are now public, and the new Api object helps putting them together as a stack. Some default stack configurations are offered. The router is now an App that sits on top of the stack of Middlewares. Which means that the router is no longer required to use Go-Json-Rest.

_Design ideas and discussion [See here](https://github.com/ant0ine/go-json-rest/issues/110)_

743958,2014-11-30T18:36:00Z,2014-11-30T19:32:34Z,v2.1.0,"# Main changes
- Apache-style access log
- Improved timer and recorder middlewares
- new JSONP middleware
- Make the gzip middleware support streaming responses 

## Apache-style access log

**Go-Json-Rest now reuses the well known Apache log formatting syntax to define the access log.**

With this new feature, the user can define his own record format:

``` go
rest.ResourceHandler{
        LoggerFormat: ""%t %r %s %b"",
}
```

or pick a predefined one:

``` go
rest.ResourceHandler{
        LoggerFormat: rest.CommonLogFormat,
}
```

or just just ignore this field and get a default, development friendly access log.

This is an implementation of a subset of the Apache mod_log_config syntax. Some options are not implemented yet, I expect the support can grow over time.
See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_log_config.html for reference.
And See Godoc for the list of supported options and predefined formats: https://godoc.org/github.com/ant0ine/go-json-rest/rest#AccessLogFormat

Note: Compatibility with the existing JSON logging is maintained. This JSON logging feature may be deprecated in the future is favor of a more powerful one. Internally, logMiddleware is replaced by accessLogApacheMiddleware and accessLogJsonMiddleware.

## Improved timer and recorder middlewares
- timerMiddleware now populates `request.Env[""START_TIME""]`
- recorderMiddleware now records `request.Env[""BYTES_WRITTEN""]`
- tests have been added to both

## JSONP middleware

This is a new public middleware that can be instantiated like this:

``` go
    handler := rest.ResourceHandler{
        PreRoutingMiddlewares: []rest.Middleware{
            &rest.JsonpMiddleware{
                CallbackNameKey: ""cb"",
            },
        },
    }
```

See the complete example here: https://github.com/ant0ine/go-json-rest#jsonp

## Make the gzip middleware support streaming responses

The gzip Writer is now instantiated once per response, allowing multiple calls to response.Write() or response.WriteJson().
See the streaming example here: https://github.com/ant0ine/go-json-rest#streaming
