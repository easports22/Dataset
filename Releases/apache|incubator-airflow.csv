- [scheduler] the notion of DAG runs allows for more parallelization, and controls around scheduling (max number of running task instance per DAG, max number of DAG runs to be evaluated for scheduling, ...)
- [scheduler] support for ""externally triggered"" DAG runs, or DAGs that run on demand as opposed to on a schedule
- [scheduler] support for cron-like syntax (as in: ""0 0 \* \* *"") and macros (as in ""@montlhly"", ""@hourly"", ""@weekly"", ...)
- UI changes related to new scheduler features
- LDAP authentication for the web UI, more extensible authentication backend
- UI activity logging
- WebHdfsSensor and Hook for HDFS interactions that are py3 compatible
- Continuous integration with Travis-UI and Coveralls
- ShortCircuitOperator
- python3 compatibility!
- Tons of bug fixes and incremental improvements

- Some Kerberos integration for Hive / Hadoop
- DAG's graph view legend for states are now toggles to highlight tasks in specific states
- Automated zombie task instance killing as part of the scheduler's routine. The process looks for running tasks that don't have a heartbeat and kills them
- MySqlHook bulk load option
- More options in the UI's Mark Success form
- MySQL uses `mysqlclient` lib instead of `mysql-python`
- Using gunicorn instead of tornado as the wsgi web server
- OracleHook
- FTPHook
- Much more! tons of bug fixes and usability improvements.

1767243,2015-09-04T06:10:30Z,2015-09-04T06:29:30Z,,"v1.5.0 is a huge release. Tons of important features.

Make sure to run `airflow upgradedb` after you upgrade

Improvements:
- @jlowin landed a feature to communicate information across tasks called XCom, more information [here](http://pythonhosted.org/airflow/concepts.html#xcoms)
- @neovintage integrated Airflow with Alembic, making database migration easy, run `airflow upgradedb` to get your database up to date as you upgrade Airflow
- The dependency engine is now more flexible, allowing for [trigger rules](http://pythonhosted.org/airflow/concepts.html#trigger-rules), before this update, tasks would only be triggered when all dependencies were successful (still the default), now you can set tasks to trigger when a single parent succeeds, when one fails, when they all fail, or to fire regardless of their dependencies:
- @neovintage added support for connection to be defined in environment variables, allowing to bypass or override the metadata database
- @jlowin improved the tree view to render a non expendable when trees go above 5k nodes
- The Druid hook and HiveToDruidTransfer are maturing and becoming production grade
- @kapil-malik added a UI feature where some users can only see their own DAGs while superusers can still see all, this feature is turned off by default
- Allowing all operators and some preoperators to receive list of sql statements to be execute as a chain
- Improved the task_instance table to log the operator name and queued timestamp
- Passwords in the metadata can now be encrypted
- Improvements to the unit tests (speed + coverage)
- Bugfixes + more
