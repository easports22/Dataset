ARDUINO 1.6.6 - 2015.11.03

[ide]
- Switched to Java 8, which is now both bundled and needed for compiling the IDE
- Added link to unofficial boards support list in preferences
- Limit of possible new sketches in a day raised to 676. Thanks @Chris--A
- Windows: fixed a bug when running username had non ASCII chars
- Lots of fixes
- ArduinoISP examples moved under 11.ArduinoISP folder
- MacOSX: binary is now able to tell the IDE its current working directory. Eases life to those using the IDE from the CLI
- CLI: if specified board doesn't exist, fail instead of using a default one
- Windows: IDE stores its stuff under %LOCALAPPDATA% instead of %APPDATA% (which was a roaming folder). %APPDATA% content is automatically migrated to new location
- Added 74880 baud rate to serial monitor. Thanks @Chris--A
- When changing tab, file name is shown in window title
- IDE groups compiled files into ""libraries"", ""core"" and ""sketch"" folders
- Added Serial Plotter. Thanks @henningpohl

- Each open sketch gets built in its own folder, allowing the IDE to recycle previous compilations and being much faster
- ""Go to line"": CTRL+L or Edit > Go to line... will open a dialog where you can type the line number where you want the editor to jump to
- Added boards.local.txt support: like platform.local.txt, allows to enrich a boards.txt definition without modifying the original file. Thanks @Wackerbarth
- Library to library dependencies: when your sketch imports a library, and that library uses another, the IDE will find out without you having to add a useless #include to your sketch
- Allow per-platform keywords.txt. Thanks @PaulStoffregen
- Allow spaces in IDE install path on Linux. Thanks @matthijskooijman
- Fixed a lot of documentation. Thanks to @per1234 @q2dg
