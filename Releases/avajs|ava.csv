### `NODE_ENV=test` ✨

AVA will now set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `'test'`, as long as the `NODE_ENV` environment variable has not already been set. 42e7c74

### Improved snapshot storage location 🗃

Snapshots are stored alongside your test files. This is great when your test file is executed directly but say if you're using TypeScript to precompile your test file AVA would store the snapshots in your build directory. In this release, if source maps are available, AVA determines the original test file location and uses that to store the snapshots.

You can also specify where snapshots are stored through the `snapshotLocation` option in the `package.json` file. 7fadc34

### Matching anonymous tests 🕵️

`--match='*'` now matches all tests, including those without a title. 1df502d

## Miscellaneous 🎒

* The verbose logger now only displays the timestamp when in watch mode 1ea758f
* Anonymous functions are now included in stack traces c72f4f2
* Concurrency is now capped at `2` in CI environments 3f81fc4
* AVA no longer calls `Bluebird.longStackTraces()`. If you're using [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/) you may want to call this yourself using a `require` script. ebf78b3 61101d9
* There's a new recipe for [endpoint testing using Mongoose](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/endpoint-testing-with-mongoose.md) c9fe8db
* The [browser testing](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/browser-testing.md) recipe has been updated with an example of exposing global variables, such as jQuery f43d5ae
* `t.log()` is now supported in the Flow and TypeScript type definitions 64b7755
* `t.title` is now supported in the TypeScript type definitions 3c8b1be
* `t.snapshot()` now has a better Flow type definition ded7ab8

## Highlights

### Default concurrency

We now cap the number of concurrent workers to the number of CPU cores on your machine. Previously AVA started workers for each test file, so if you had many test files this could actually bring things to a halt. 465fcecc9ae0d3274d4d41d3baaca241d6a40130

You can still customize the concurrency by setting the `concurrency` option in AVA's `package.json` configuration, or by passing the `--concurrency` flag. We've also beefed up input validation on that flag. b6eef5ac30e7839371a420f17060f62f971717aa

Unfortunately this does change how `test.only()` behaves. AVA can no longer guarantee that normal tests won't run. For now, if you want to use `test.only()`, you should run tests from just that file. We have an open issue to add an `--only` flag, which will ensure that AVA runs just the `test.only()` tests. If you'd like to help us with that please head on over to #1472.

### `t.log()`

We've also added `t.log()`, which lets you print a log message contextually alongside the test result, instead of immediately printing it to `stdout` like `console.log`. 14f7095d25abc5ffbff7efd7db962eaf5e86daab

### Miscellaneous

* The [WebStorm recipe](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/debugging-with-webstorm.md) has been updated with instructions on how to enable the Node.js inspector. d8c21a6b8102bcc11daacba2ea6af6f9b9713959

6863656,2017-06-28T14:04:43Z,2017-06-28T14:05:04Z,0.20.0,"Today’s release is very exciting. After adding [magic assert](https://github.com/avajs/ava/#magic-assert) and [snapshot testing](https://github.com/avajs/ava/#snapshot-testing) we found that these features sometimes disagreed with each other. `t.deepEqual()` would return `false`, yet AVA wouldn’t show a diff. Snapshot tests cared about `Set` order but `t.deepEqual()` didn’t. @novemberborn came to the realization that comparing and diffing object trees, and doing so over time with snapshots, are variations on the same problem. Thus he started [ConcordanceJS](https://github.com/concordancejs), a new project that lets you compare, format, diff and serialize any JavaScript value. This AVA release reaps the fruits of his labor.

## Highlights

### More magical asserts

Magic assert will now always show the difference between actual and expected values. If an unexpected error occurs it’ll print all (enumerable) properties of the error which can make it easier to debug your program.

![Example of a formatted exception](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_175CE21AB04CD43514E95D82F85BEF2470C159EA6B7ACAB772F04105747B8EC3_1498645982254_Screen+Shot+2017-06-28+at+11.29.59.png)

More details of an object are printed, like the constructor name and the string tag. Buffers are hex-encoded with line breaks so they’re easy to read:

![Example of diffed Buffers](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_175CE21AB04CD43514E95D82F85BEF2470C159EA6B7ACAB772F04105747B8EC3_1498648050196_Screen+Shot+2017-06-28+at+12.05.45.png)


### `t.deepEqual()` improvements

`t.deepEqual()` and `t.notDeepEqual()` now use [`concordance`](https://github.com/concordancejs/concordance), rather than [`lodash.isequal`](https://lodash.com/docs/#isEqual). This changes what values AVA considers to be equal, making the `t.deepEqual()` assertion more predictable. You can now trust that all aspects of your objects are compared.

[Object wrappers](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/types%20%26%20grammar/ch3.md#boxing-wrappers) are no longer equal. The following assertion will now fail:

```js
t.deepEqual(Object(1), 1); // fails
```

For `Map` and `Set` objects to be equal, their elements must now be in the same order:

```js
const actual = new Set(['hello', 'world']);
t.deepEqual(actual, new Set(['hello', 'world'])); // passes
t.deepEqual(actual, new Set(['world', 'hello']) // fails
```

With this release AVA will compare all enumerable properties of an object. For an array this means that the comparison considers not just the array elements. The following are no longer considered equal:

```js
const actual = [1, 2, 3];
const expected = [1, 2, 3];
expected.also = 'a property';
t.deepEqual(actual, expected); // fails
```

The same goes for `Map` and `Set` objects, errors, and so forth:

```js
const actual = new TypeError('Bad value');
const expected = new TypeError('Bad value');
expected.value = 41;
t.deepEqual(actual, expected); // fails
```

You used to be able to compare `Arguments` object to an object literal:

```js
const args = (function() { return arguments; })('hello', 'world');
t.deepEqual(args, {0: 'hello', 1: 'world'}); // now fails
```

Instead you must now use:

```js
const args = (function() { return arguments; })('hello', 'world');
t.deepEqual(args, ['hello', 'world']); // passes
```

(Of course you can still compare `Arguments` objects to each other.)

New in this release is the ability to compare [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) elements:

```js
t.deepEqual(<HelloWorld/>, <HelloWorld/>);

const renderer = require('react-test-renderer');
t.deepEqual(renderer.create(<HelloWorld/>).toJSON(), <h1>Hello World</h1>);
```

### Snapshot improvements

Snapshots too now use [`concordance`](https://github.com/concordancejs/concordance). This means values are compared with the snapshot according to the same rules as `t.deepEqual()`, albeit with some minor differences:


- `Argument` objects can only be compared to `Argument` objects
- Functions are compared by name and other enumerable properties
- Promises are compared by their constructor and additional enumerable properties
- Symbols are compared by their string serialization. [Registered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#Shared_symbols_in_the_global_symbol_registry) and [well-known symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#Well-known_symbols) will never equal symbols with similar descriptions

Note that Node.js versions before 6.5 [cannot infer names of all functions ](http://node.green/#ES2015-built-in-extensions-function--name--property). AVA will pass a snapshot assertion if it determines the name information is unreliable.

AVA now saves two files when snapshotting. One, ending in the `.snap` extension, contains a compressed serialization of the expected value. The other is a readable Markdown file that contains the snapshot report. You should commit both to source control. The report file can be used to see what is in your snapshots and to compare snapshot changes over time.

Try it out with our [snapshot example](https://github.com/avajs/ava-snapshot-example)! Or check out an [example snapshot report](https://gist.github.com/novemberborn/9b2607f2fa29e4c03cfd64e3315c5070).

The snapshot file location now follows your test layout. If you use a `test` folder, they’ll be placed in `test/snapshots`. With `__tests__` they’ll be placed in `__tests__/__snapshots__`. And if you just have a `test.js` in your project root the snapshot files will be written to `test.js.snap` and `test.js.md`. You may have to manually remove old snapshot files after installing this new AVA version. ebd572a02debe8e17802f795e6cd618073c8d787

**Improved snapshot support in watch mode**

In watch mode, AVA now watches for changes to snapshot files. This is handy when you revert changes while the watcher is running. Snapshot files are correctly tracked as test dependencies, so the right tests are rerun. Typing  `u`, followed by `Enter`  updates the snapshots in the tests that just ran. (And the watcher won’t rerun tests when snapshots are updated.) 87eef846392d04b727b57981a16f7e8429a04195 dbc78dc19cb759b6b72946bc1b833abc284cfab2 f507e364c4be8ac0f5702b9fd31ac634b9ec35cb 50b60a11aecf9bc6945b7e836a9ec8855bbcd86e

### Node.js 8 support

AVA 0.19 already worked great with Node.js 8, and we’ve made it even better by removing unnecessary Babel transpilations in our [`stage-4` preset](https://github.com/avajs/babel-preset-stage-4). We’re now also forwarding the `--inspect-brk` flag for debugging purposes. e45695197c8ba5d0ec7df7a7fe38f00f9a5f5fb0 a868b02f7cdee89d82bd22b3f4f47da2e1cba6ac

### New and improved recipes

We’ve added new recipes and improved others:

### Miscellaneous

- Specifying `--concurrency` without a value now causes AVA to exit with an error 8c35a1a4b61c3f91d8c7b61e185dd5b450402bc0

## Highlights

### Working snapshots

We released snapshot support with [`v0.18.0`](https://github.com/avajs/ava/releases/tag/v0.18.0), but unfortunately it didn’t work. That’s fixed now. Since we’re using `jest-snapshot` the output will look a little different from AVA’s other assertions. Most notably the output will not be colored.

57fd051

### Tests fail if no assertions are run (BREAKING)

Sometimes you write a test that accidentally passes, because your assertion was never run. For example, the following test passes if `getAnimals()` returns an empty array:

```js
test('unicorn', t => {
  for (const animal of getAnimals()) {
    t.is(animal, 'unicorn');
  }
});
```

AVA now fails your test if no assertions were run. This can be a problem if you use third-party assertion libraries, since AVA cannot detect when those assertions pass. You can disable this behavior by setting the `failWithoutAssertions` option to `false` in AVA's [`package.json` configuration](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/v0.19.0/readme.md#configuration).

3a4553c

### Improved `t.throws()` and `t.notThrows()` assertions (BREAKING)

Various improvements have been made to these assertions. Unfortunately this does include some breaking changes.

Calling these assertions with an observable or promise makes them asynchronous. You now need to `await` them:

```js
const promise = Promise.reject(new TypeError('🦄'));

test('rejects', async t => {
  await t.throws(promise);
});
```

Previously, these would return a promise that was rejected if the assertion failed. This leaked AVA’s internal assertion error. Now they’ll fulfill their returned promise with `undefined` instead (d56db75). You typically won’t notice this in your test.

We’ve improved how we detect when `t.throws()` and `t.notThrows()` are used incorrectly (d924045). This might be when, rather than passing a function, you call it:

```js
test('throws', t => {
  t.throws(throwingFunction());
});
```

You can now use `await` and `yield` in the argument expressions (e.g. `t.throws(await createThrowingFunction())`. The instructions on how to use these assertions correctly are now shown with the test failure, instead of being written to the console as your tests run.

Incorrectly using these assertions now always causes your test to fail.

Stack traces are now correct, even if used asynchronously (f6a42ba). The error messages have been improved for when `t.throws()` fails to encounter an error, or if `t.notThrows()` does (4463f38). If `t.notThrows()` fails, the encountered error is shown (22c93ed).

### Improved magic assert output

Actual and/or expected values are now included in the [magic assert](https://github.com/avajs/ava#magic-assert) output, with helpful labels that are relevant to the failing assertion.

4f87f32

### Detect hanging tests

AVA can now detect when an asynchronous test is hanging (880e87e).

Note that this may not work if your code is listening on a socket or is using a timer or interval.

### Better Babel option resolution

We’re now resolving Babel options ahead of time, using [`hullabaloo-config-manager`](https://github.com/novemberborn/hullabaloo-config-manager). This fixes long-standing issues with relative paths in AVA’s `""babel""` options in `package.json` files (#707). It also means we’re better at recompiling test and helper files if your Babel config changes or you update plugins or presets.

We have prepared lots of tasty things for you - snapshot testing, magic assert, precompiling test helpers, improvements to Babel transpilation, and more. Our team and contributors have been working hard to deliver all this goodness. We can’t wait to hear your feedback and don’t hesitate to suggest new ideas and [report bugs](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/contributing.md#submitting-an-issue)!

## Highlights

### Dropped support for Node.js 0.10 and 0.12

As mentioned in the [0.17.0 release notes](https://github.com/avajs/ava/releases/tag/v0.17.0), we’re dropping support for Node.js 0.10 and 0.12 in this release. They’re both out of maintenance mode. Time to upgrade!

### Magic assert

![magic-assert-combined2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/170270/22558318/d782e9a4-e99f-11e6-889e-62fd4ad36e66.png)

We completely overhauled the error output to make it as easy and fast as possible to detect the source of the failure. [Magic assert](https://github.com/avajs/ava#magic-assert), as we call it internally, adds code excerpts and clean diffs for actual and expected values. If values in the assertion are objects or arrays, only a difference is displayed to remove the noise and focus on the problem. Oh, and the diff is syntax-highlighted too! If you are comparing strings, both single and multi line, AVA displays a different kind of output, highlighting the added or missing characters. Last but not least, you don’t have to update any of your tests to take advantage of this! Third-party assertion libraries, like expect, chai and others, are supported out-of-the-box as well.

https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/c9e6e6fafacad3f54536dc9122555e939d13aa21

### Snapshot testing

We now have [snapshot testing](https://github.com/avajs/ava#snapshot-testing), thanks to @lithin ✨

![snapshot-testing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/170270/22558118/2eccb1e6-e99f-11e6-8557-5d46a80b475e.png)

Snapshot testing simply saves a stringified state of some data structure and compares it on the next run. It was popularized with React component testing, but you can use it with anything that can be stringified. For example, ensuring API responses stay the same.
https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/ee65b6dbbb187eb8dd2dfb929febb9df161cf6e9

### Precompile helper files

Previously, AVA transpiled your test files, but not your test helpers. Now we [transpile helper files](https://github.com/avajs/ava#transpiling-imported-modules) too! Helpers are files starting with `_` or any files in a `helpers` directory inside the test directory. These are usually used for utilities and shared logic between test files.
https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/410cb8d3b1bb70b48dd305b0bc69843579f9205d

### Improving language support

We’ve come up with a specification for how AVA handles Babel projects and may better support other languages like TypeScript. Customizing transpilation of test and helper files will be easier, and AVA will start transpiling source files too. We’ve started work on this, but there are no user-facing changes yet.
https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/076eb81cf579a49b02fd1f31b7123274ef88007b

### Miscellaneous
- Removed deprecated assertions (`t.ok`, `t.notOk`, `t.same`, `t.notSame`). If you haven’t migrated yet, you can do so automagically with our [codemod](https://github.com/avajs/ava-codemods#upgrade-ava-version). https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/c010fd7f7be1c8ac51e56f98375470819e6a7e44
- Removed the `--source` flag. Use the [package.json config](https://github.com/avajs/ava#configuration) instead. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/34bebc450d7ee6fef99684a5a7c0aea67695b772
- Support symlinked test files. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/033d4dcdcbdadbf665c740ff450c2a775a8373dc
- No longer using `babel-runtime`. Built-ins like `Map` and `Promise` are no longer replaced with polyfills. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/ad5122d507bfaa044fc3a2e51e467238e16dba11
- Prints a warning when `test.only()` is used, so you don’t mistakenly think you’re running all the tests. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/22a60818afe6f5f7ae09979e148a9ce7ea37a90c
- Prints a warning when `--fail-fast` is enabled, so you’re aware AVA didn’t run all your tests. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/09d23f56c099c78129a7d32aa9f9a2394278dd32
- Exits with an error when `--watch` is used in CI, as otherwise the process would never exit, since watch mode is persistent. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/0606ff708fc24f868ad3280e984c8807f47533b7
- Only transpile what’s needed on Node.js 6. We already did that for Node.js 4. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/5158ac8bb0d0a79acde12c1bf6dfc1bbf32fd71e

We made the hard decision of changing the current working directory (`process.cwd()`) in test files to be the same directory as `package.json`. It was previously the same as `__dirname` (the directory of the test file). Having `process.cwd()` equal `__dirname` [felt like a good idea](https://github.com/avajs/ava/issues/32) at the time, but as the popularity of AVA grew, people started hitting issues with it.

This affects users that have test files in a sub-folder and are using relative paths. If you have your test files in the same directory as `package.json`, you're fine.

The fix is to wrap all relative paths in `path.join(__dirname, 'relative-path')` to make them absolute.

Here's an example of what needs changing. The below file and `unicorn.txt` are both in `./test/`.

``` diff
-t.true(fs.existsSync('unicorn.txt'));
+t.true(fs.existsSync(path.join(__dirname, 'unicorn.txt')));
```

## Node.js version support

The next minor version of AVA, 0.18.0, will drop support for Node.js v0.10 and v0.12. We'll continue fixing critical issues for this version until the end of the year. Time to upgrade if you haven't. (Discussion: https://github.com/avajs/ava/issues/1051)

## Highlights
- We now have a [script](https://github.com/avajs/ava-codemods#migrating-to-ava) to automatically migrate from [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) to AVA.
- Our [ESLint plugin](https://github.com/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava) received two new rules:
  - https://github.com/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava/commit/7cfdf3444ad3567ab40644953e754a49cd5fce78
  - https://github.com/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava/commit/a443d7a9c94165f42749938e6b491a7c10749b6c
- Reduced transpilation on Node.js >=4. AVA now only transpiles what's needed for Node.js 4 when on it or higher, which should result in better performance and stacktraces. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/4025d81b26b4ed9b8772cd7d3264199e11a7d8c5
- Removed the `--require` CLI flag. Configure it in package.json instead. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/17119bcfd822854b0b3bb99e8c14830f9cea50d4
- Switched to [`lodash.isEqual`](https://lodash.com/docs/#isEqual) for deep equality checking (`t.deepEqual()` & `t.notDeepEqual()`). This might make your test fail if our previous deep equality check was too loose. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/885668428a165274685763840b3ca06cf91a467d
- Improvements to the test failure output. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/e4f90e0f7a9e2597d4375aa6a925dbeb02b26ecf (We're currently working on many more improvements in this area. Stay tuned.)
- Added option to disable `power-assert`. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/24a38acc5b1b3e3deb77af54d90dda4677bd7749
- Correctly clean up stacktraces on Node.js 6 and higher. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/26bcab0273323fcdb04f1409abe913fe030dee77
- Removed `t.doesNotThrow()` as it was renamed to `t.notThrows()`. It was deprecated far back in AVA 0.12.0. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/e4487986cd6fefa442124ef3b03cfd91cccdd66f
- Deprecated `t.error()` alias for `t.ifError()`. It will be removed in AVA 1.0.0. Just use `t.ifError()`. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/28bb0d5cb2907282d61e224acdf621ce3c1abdfd **(We have an [automatic migration script](https://github.com/avajs/ava-codemods#upgrading-to-017x) if you're using `t.error()`)**
- Ensures test files load correct AVA installation. This means you can now run AVA with an absolute path and it will still use the local AVA installation at that path if available. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/3ea2ba11329141c095093e25b5f0de2ecf7fac79
- Added support for debugging tests with WebStorm and added a [recipe](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/debugging-with-webstorm.md). https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/c268c8dfce325010f84dd4097ba8696c5f3a47c1
- Added [Flow](https://flowtype.org) type defintion. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/6458454951a595bc1fd93a6ae7f1c6ef57df56ff
- Improvements to the TypeScript type definition. https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/4baa17038451f07ebe5d81a0ed42590e69913394 https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/8816faf6bee675213c5bfe32f628a0a683708484 https://github.com/avajs/ava/commit/c40477a0f34d5a6efb8cd28fd5201c30427905e8

We have worked hard on fixing bugs and improving performance. Going forward stability and performance will be our top priority as we're progressing towards a stable release. Finally, we're delighted to welcome @sotojuan to the team! 🎉

## Test file conventions

When you run AVA without any arguments, it tries to find your test files based on some conventions. The previous release had the following default patterns:

```
test.js test-*.js test/**/*.js
```

In this release we added additional default patterns based on community conventions:

```
test.js test-*.js test/**/*.js **/__tests__/**/*.js **/*.test.js
```

This means AVA will now also run test files in `__tests__` directories and test files ending in `.test.js` anywhere in your project.

9ceeb115e75172c01e86bce8e94c2d2fcd8d094a

## Known failing tests

A big part of open source maintenance is triaging issues. This can be a tedious task, involving a lot of back and forth with the person reporting the issue. Submitting a PR with a failing test makes the whole process much more efficient. It helps maintainers by providing a quality reproduction, allowing them to focus on code over triaging. Users benefit as their [bugs get fixed faster](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/579306280495357953).

To make it easier to submit failing tests, we're introducing a new test modifier: [`test.failing()`](https://github.com/avajs/ava#failing-tests). These tests are run just like normal ones, but they are expected to fail, and will not break your build when they do. If a test marked as failing actually passes, the build **will break** with a helpful message instructing you to remove the `.failing` modifier.

``` js
test.failing('demonstrate some bug', t => {
    t.fail(); // test will count as passed
});
```

This allows you to merge `.failing` tests before a fix is implemented without breaking CI. It is also a great way to recognize good bug reports with a commit credit, even if the reporter is unable to fix the problem.

## Test macros

Sometimes you want to run a series of very similar tests, each with different inputs and expected results. The traditional solution is to use [test generator functions](https://github.com/avajs/ava-codemods/blob/47073b5b58aa6f3fb24f98757be5d3f56218d160/test/ok-to-truthy.js#L7-L9). However, this makes it difficult to perform static analysis on the tests, which is especially important for [linting](https://github.com/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava). In this release, we are introducing test macros as the official way to create reusable tests.

Test macros let you reuse test implementations. Additional arguments passed in the test declaration are forwarded to the macro:

``` js
function macro(t, input, expected) {
    t.is(eval(input), expected);
}

test('2 + 2 === 4', macro, '2 + 2', 4);
test('2 * 3 === 6', macro, '2 * 3', 6);
```

If you are generating lots of tests from a single macro, you may want to generate the test title programmatically:

``` js
macro.title = (providedTitle, input, expected) => {
 return `${input} === ${expected}`
};
```

a4541289491e7f839e7c9417fa0f01a76af42946

## Always modifiers for after and afterEach hooks

By default `after` and `afterEach` hooks will not be run if the preceding test fails. This is undesirable if the hooks contain cleanup code that you want run regardless. You can change that behavior using the `.always` chaining modifier.

``` js
test.after.always(t => {
  // always runs at the end. Regardless of test pass/fail state.
});

test.afterEach.always(t => {
  // always runs after each test. Regardless of test pass/fail state.
});
```

Note that the `--fail-fast` switch will disable this behavior, and AVA will exit at the first encountered failure without waiting for the `always` hooks.

61f09584ce3b1b0ae088cc8b47446028f71ae812

## Limited concurrency _[EXPERIMENTAL]_

Concurrency is awesome! It's what makes AVA so fast. Our default behavior is to spin up an isolated process for every test file immediately, and then run all your tests. However, for users with lots of test files, this was eating up too many system resources, causing memory and IO thrashing. We are experimenting with an option to let you limit how many tests files AVA runs at the same time. If you have a _lot_ of test files, try running AVA with the `--concurrency` flag. For example, run `$ ava --concurrency=5` and see if the performance improves. Please [let us know](https://gitter.im/avajs/ava) how it works for you! We need feedback on the feature.

_Note: This is an experimental feature and might change or be removed in the future._

## All Changes

We’ve merged [92 commits from 23 contributors](https://github.com/avajs/ava/compare/v0.14.0...v0.15.0) since `0.14.0`.  This only scratches the surface, as lots of additional work has gone into our [linter](https://github.com/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava), [localized docs](https://github.com/avajs/ava-docs) and countless other projects that make AVA possible. To everyone who’s reported bugs, contributed to design discussions, and filed PR’s with documentation or code - **Thank You!**

2968734,2016-04-07T01:56:49Z,2016-04-07T01:59:30Z,0.14.0,"The biggest change in this release is the deprecation of `t.ok`, `t.notOk`, `t.same`, and `t.notSame` assertions. We have published a [codemod](https://github.com/jamestalmage/ava-codemods) (automatic migration script) which should make switching to the new assertion methods very easy.

Also, we've added a [`--timeout`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava#global-timeout) flag that will stop test execution after a certain period of inactivity.

### Highlights
- A number of [assertion methods](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava#assertions) have been renamed for clarity. The old methods still exist, but have been deprecated, and will be removed in a future release (e9c6cc2843e9ee6127aebb2843eafec86cb39bfc, a7f50eb82d8dae4f9a7e70ae33ef71712a8fd69b). We have published [`ava-codemods`](https://github.com/jamestalmage/ava-codemods) to assist in automatically renaming these assertions in your tests.
  - `t.ok()` → `t.truthy()`
  - `t.notOk()` → `t.falsy()`
  - `t.same()` → `t.deepEqual()` 
  - `t.notSame()` → `t.notDeepEqual()` 
- Added an [idle timeout option](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava#global-timeout) to prevent test runs from hanging indefinitely. The test run is considered timed out when no test results have been received for the specified interval. d1a3669ed25919a5aba2316e12da02f2584666ae
- Published a recipe on [various ways to configure Babel](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/babelrc.md). bcda7537dda7eeb38bef3405e1265226ba6d69ae
- Updated Russian, Chinese, and Spanish translations. Big thanks to our [translation team](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava-docs/graphs/contributors)!

### Of Note
- `t.deepEqual()` (formerly `t.same()`) no longer compares constructors. a7826cf1c81a38eaa0908c8ae37525e82a43c192
- Truncate test titles in the mini reporter. 6d5f3225cc712f10e7a0a8a9c6e40d574fd4b251
- Fix `t.throws()` not returning error for synchronous methods. 26d2291c9f72097e49f19533a4b55875f1d62134
- Now throws a meaningful error if `--require` dependency is not found. c78e7367d07ea1a27158a35972184de266d04230
- Watch mode will now rerun all `.only` tests regardless of dependency graph. e57908a91aad0e875c8a2ca9157edc7c4e0840b5
- Print the planned and actual assertion count when there is a plan failure. 07febb2c53b61e8774ff41062e84a4a60f70f40e
- Workaround for Node.js bug which could kill main process. cd6961a63ba08cf3bf5d912f0b80838e9c713736
- Mini reporter no longer flashes test titles for `skip`/`todo` tests. ecc87cbd202fd8f4df8db9dd38657647fb379993
- Display a helpful error message for invalid Babel config. febbaa2adbc97be32088d9196552c5810b84ad30
- Switch from `serialize-error` to `clean-yaml-object` (better compatibility with `node-tap`). cd5767e1881173ffd8a65646bd5d5a1445bb17ab
- Rewrite `require(""babel-runtime"")` in tests to absolute path (allows module resolution for `npm@2` without modifying `NODE_PATHS`). 382e50dc4274971ca1da0dfc5f79728787f60957
- Ensure source maps can be resolved from cached code. 592ff138580e1aca6b7506b94bed7603cd2f39e4

### Improved performance

Babel transpilation of test files now happens in the main process. This avoids requiring Babel in every child process and greatly improves performance. This is an especially important improvement for people still running `npm@2`.

New `power-assert` updates reduce the size of it's dependency graph. Offering improvements to both download times and performance.

### Clean `console.log` output.

The test status output and `console.log` statements from within your own code will no longer interfere with each other. The test status remains fixed at the bottom of the output.

We were finally able to upgrade to Babel 6.

We strongly recommend using npm@3 as Babel 6 is very modular and the npm@3 default deduplication is important for performance and size reasons.

_This change has no effect on what Babel version you use in your own project. We bundle our own Babel version._

You can now get [TAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol) output instead of our builtin reporter by using the `--tap` flag.

Use any of the myriad of [TAP reporters](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-tap#reporters). Like the [tap-nyan](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/tap-nyan) reporter as seen above.

This is how we'll support custom reporters in AVA. Write a TAP reporter. We're not interested in creating another silo of test runner specific reporters.

### Breaking changes

There are some breaking changes in this release that significantly improves the test interface.

#### `test()` is now only for synchronous or promise/observable returning tests

The main `test()` interface is now synchronous by default and can be made asynchronous by returning a promise/observable or using a async/generator function (which implicitly returns a promise).

You no longer have to call `t.end()` in synchronous tests:

``` diff
 test(t => {
    t.pass();
-   t.end();
})
```

You can no longer use `test()` for callback-style APIs, so we've introduced a new [""callback mode"" `test.cb()`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava#testcbtitle-body).

``` diff
-test(t => {
+test.cb(t => {
    fn(err => {
        t.ifError(err);
        t.end();
    });
 });
```

https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/commit/387c30a056cdd3ef8510262ce2119031c8d18361 https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/commit/717030813a51d349830e28a7b77b4014837d6eac

#### `t.plan()` will no longer auto-end tests

You will now have to explicitly end tests with callback-style APIs. Previously, `t.plan()` doubled as both an assert counter and ending the test when the assertion count was reached. This was a mistake. It's now only an assert counter. We are now able to warn on too many async assertion which were previously not possible. Note that `t.end()` only works in ""callback mode"" `test.cb()`.

``` diff
-test(t => {
+test.cb(t => {
    t.plan(1);

    fn(err => {
        t.ifError(err);
+       t.end();
    });
 });
```

### Highlights
- Test methods are now [chainable](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava#chaining-test-modifiers). You can for example do `test.serial.skip()`. https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/commit/d874ec9642a08492d3dc01ff311c23ddfeaa0797
