### Service Client Updates

  * Amazon ElastiCache for Redis today announced support for data encryption both for data in-transit and data at-rest.

The encryption at-rest functionality allows customers to encrypt their S3 based backups. Customers can begin using the new functionality by simply enabling this functionality via AWS console, and a small configuration change in their Redis clients. The ElastiCache for Redis service automatically manages life cycle of the certificates required for encryption, including the issuance, renewal and expiration of certificates. Additionally, as part of this launch, customers will gain the ability to start using the Redis AUTH command that provides an added level of authentication.

  * You can now prevent a stack from being accidentally deleted by enabling termination protection on the stack. If you attempt to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the deletion fails and the stack, including its status, remains unchanged. You can enable termination protection on a stack when you create it. Termination protection on stacks is disabled by default. After creation, you can set termination protection on a stack whose status is CREATE_COMPLETE, UPDATE_COMPLETE, or UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE.

### Service Client Updates
* `service/codedeploy`: Updates service API and documentation
  * This release introduces the previousRevision field in the responses to the GetDeployment and BatchGetDeployments actions. previousRevision provides information about the application revision that was deployed to the deployment group before the most recent successful deployment.  Also, the fileExistsBehavior parameter has been added for CreateDeployment action requests. In the past, if the AWS CodeDeploy agent detected files in a target location that weren't part of the application revision from the most recent successful deployment, it would fail the current deployment by default. This new parameter provides options for how the agent handles these files: fail the deployment, retain the content, or overwrite the content.

  * This change adds a `SharedConfigFiles` field to the `session.Options` type that allows you to specify the files, and their order, the SDK will use for loading shared configuration and credentials from when the `Session` is created. Use the `NewSessionWithOptions` Session constructor to specify these options. You'll also most likely want to enable support for the shared configuration file's additional attributes by setting `session.Option`'s `SharedConfigState` to `session.SharedConfigEnabled`.

  * Amazon Web Services announced the immediate availability of two additional alarm configuration rules for Amazon CloudWatch Alarms. The first rule is for configuring missing data treatment. Customers have the options to treat missing data as alarm threshold breached, alarm threshold not breached, maintain alarm state and the current default treatment. The second rule is for alarms based on percentiles metrics that can trigger unnecassarily if the percentile is calculated from a small number of samples. The new rule can treat percentiles with low sample counts as same as missing data. If the first rule is enabled, the same treatment will be applied when an alarm encounters a percentile with low sample counts.

Using the cache refresh feature in this update, the customer can trigger an on-demand scan of the keys in their S3 bucket and refresh the file namespace cached on the gateway. It takes as an input the fileShare ARN and refreshes the cache for only that file share. Additionally there is new functionality on file gateway that allows you configure what squash options they would like on their file share, this allows a customer to configure their gateway to not squash root permissions. This can be done by setting options in NfsOptions for CreateNfsFileShare and UpdateNfsFileShare APIs.

### Service Client Updates
* `service/batch`: Updates service API, documentation, and paginators
  * Customers can now provide a retryStrategy as part of the RegisterJobDefinition and SubmitJob API calls. The retryStrategy object has a number value for attempts. This is the number of non successful executions before a job is considered FAILED. In addition, the JobDetail object now has an attempts field and shows all execution attempts.
* `service/ec2`: Updates service API and documentation
	* Customers can now tag their Amazon EC2 Instances and Amazon EBS Volumes at
	the time of their creation. You can do this from the EC2 Instance launch
	wizard or through the RunInstances or CreateVolume APIs. By tagging
	resources at the time of creation, you can eliminate the need to run custom
	tagging scripts after resource creation. In addition, you can now set
	resource-level permissions on the CreateVolume, CreateTags, DeleteTags, and
	the RunInstances APIs. This allows you to implement stronger security
	policies by giving you more granular control over which users and groups
	have access to these APIs. You can also enforce the use of tagging and
	control what tag keys and values are set on your resources. When you combine
	tag usage and resource-level IAM policies together, you can ensure your
	instances and volumes are properly secured upon creation and achieve more
	accurate cost allocation reporting. These new features are provided at no
	additional cost.

  * Adds a `Complete` Request handler list that will be called ever time a request is completed. This includes both success and failure. Complete will only be called once per API operation request.
  * `private/waiter` package moved from the private group to `aws/request` and made publicly available.

## Service Client Updates
- `service/directconnect`: Updates service API, documentation, and paginators
  - This update will introduce the ability for Direct Connect customers to take advantage of Link Aggregation (LAG).     This allows you to bundle many individual physical interfaces into a single logical interface, referred to as a LAG.     This makes administration much simpler as the majority of configuration is done on the LAG while you are free     to add or remove physical interfaces from the bundle as bandwidth demand increases or decreases. A concrete example     of the simplification added by LAG is that customers need only a single BGP session as opposed to one session per     physical connection.

### Adds support for shared config file (~/.aws/config)

Updates the SDK to take advantage of the new `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` environment variable. When set to a truthy value, as defined in strconv.ParseBool, the SDK will load both shared config file (~/.aws/config), and the shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials).  The shared credentials file has precedence over the shared config.

Both config files share the same format. Both `[name]` and `[profile name]` are accepted as section names. The first, `[name]` will be looked for first before falling back to `[profile name]` per config file.

See the [session](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/) package docs for more information.

Deprecates the `session.New` method since it cannot return an error when the session fails to load until a request is made.  `session.NewSession` corrects this by returning an error when creating the session.
