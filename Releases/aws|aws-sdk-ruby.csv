  See related [GitHub issue #1313](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/issues/1313).
- Feature - Credentials - Added the ability to configure extended retries
  when loading credentials from the instance metadata service without needing
  to construct your own `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` object:
  
  ``` ruby
  s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new(
    instance_profile_credentials_timeout: 5, # defaults to 1 second
    instance_profile_credentials_retries: 5, # defaults to 0 retries
  )
  ```
  
  These options are used by the default credential chain.
- Feature - Resources - The `#exists?` method on resources now passes additional
  arguments to the client waiter.
- Issue - Resources - Resource identifiers passed in as `nil` now correctly
  raise an `ArgumentError`.

- Feature - Aws::EC2 - Added two waiter methods to `Aws::EC2::VPC`:

  See related [GitHub pull request #1179](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/1179).
- Issue - Aws::S3 - Resolved an issue with `Aws::S3::Client#head_object` and
  `#get_object` where an `ArgumentError` was raised if Amazon S3 responded with
  an Expires header that contained an unparsable string.
  
  The `#head_object` and `#get_object` response now return `nil` when the Expires
  header contains an invalid value. You can now access the raw string value
  of the Expires header with `#expires_string`.
  
  ``` ruby
  # If Amazon S3 responds with `Expires: abc` as a header
  resp = s3.head_object(bucket:'bucket', key:'key')
  resp.expires #=> nil
  resp.expires_string #=> ""abc""

  end
  ```
  
  Lastly, you can also enumerate all partitions.
  
  ``` ruby
  Aws.partitions.each do |partition|
  
    puts partition.name
  
    partition.regions.each |region|
      # ...

- Feature - Aws::S3 - You can now pass a configuration option to accelerate
  `Aws::S3::Client` operations. You can construct a client with
  `use_accelerate_endpoint: true` to enable this feature.
  
  ``` ruby
  s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new(use_accelerate_endpoint: true)
  s3.put_object(bucket: 'bucket-name', key:'key')
  #=> uses https://bucket-name.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com
  ```
  
  You can pass `:use_accelerate_endpoint` to client operations to
  override the client default.
  
  ``` ruby
  # non-accelerated client
  s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new
  
  # non-accelerated
  s3.put_object(bucket: 'bucket-name', key:'key')
  
  # accelerated
  s3.put_object(bucket: 'bucket-name', key:'key', use_accelerate_endpoint: true)
  ```

- Feature - Aws::ACM - Initial support for the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) API. ACM is an AWS service that makes it easier for you to deploy secure SSL based websites and applications on the AWS platform. SSL is the standard protocol for encrypting communications and establishing the identity of a website over the Internet. ACM takes care of all of the complexity of obtaining, deploying, and renewing the digital certificates used with SSL. ACM makes it easier to encrypt sensitive data in transit using SSL in order to help meet regulatory and compliance requirements such as PCI-DSS, FISMA, and HIPAA. Because ACM is integrated with AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Amazon CloudFront, it’s easy to request a certificate, install it on your load balancer or CloudFront distribution, and let ACM renew and deploy it automatically.

  encountering signing errors.
  
  If you wish to continue using the 's3' signer, without auto-upgrade logic, you
  can manually choose to use the 's3' signer at client creation time:
  
  ``` ruby
  client = Aws::S3::Client.new(signature_version: 's3')

- Issue - Aws::EC2 - Fix for `:instance_exists` waiter. Instances that have been
  terminated for a long period of time could fail the previous waiter definition
  with a false positive.
  
  See [related GitHub pull request #985](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/985).
- Upgrading - Resources - All batch resource operations have been renamed to make
  it clear that they operate in batches on the entire collection.
  - All batch operations are now prefixed with `batch_`, e.g. `#start`
    is now `#batch_start`.
  - All batch operations named ""delete"" or ""terminate"" are now suffixed
    with a `!`, e.g. `#delete` is now `#batch_delete!`
  
  For backwards compatibility, existing batch methods still respond
  to their old names with a deprecation warning. New batch operations
  will strictly follow the new conventions.

- Feature - Aws::IAM - Added two new APIs that enable programmatic access to the
  AWS Identity and Access Management policy simulator.
- Feature - Aws::S3::Object - Added a `#move_to` method that copies
  the object to the destination and then deletes the source object.
- Issue - Aws::S3::Client - Added support for errors returned from
  Amazon S3 in the body of HTTP 200 responses. Previously only
  the `#complete_multipart_upload` operation handled these errors.
  Extended this to `#copy_object` and `#upload_part_copy`.
- Issue - Aws::S3::Object - The `#presigned_post` method now respects
  the configured custom endpoint.
  
  ``` ruby
  obj = Aws::S3::Object.new(""bucket"", ""key"", endpoint: ""http://custom-endpoint.com"")
  obj.presigned_post.url
  #=> ""http://bucket.custom-endpoint.com""
  ```
- Issue - Aws::S3::Presigner - Added validation to `#presigned_url` to
  ensure the `:key` option is not an empty string. This prevents a
  presigned `:get_object` URL from becoming a presigned `:list_objects`
  request on the bucket.

- Issue - AWS::S3 - Resolved an issue where the SDK would not retry errors returned
  from Amazon S3 inside the bodies of 200 status code HTTP responses. This was
  correctly handled for `AWS::S3::Client#complete_multipart_upload`, but
  not for `#copy_part`, and `:copy_object`.
  
  This fix addresses an issue where managed multipart copies would raise an
  error about a missing etag. These operations should not be retried up to
  three times and raise a terminal error if they are not successful.

- Feature - Aws::EC2 - Adds support for Amazon VPC flow logs.
- Feature - Aws::ECS - Adds the `#update_container_agent` method, as well
  as paginator and waiter support.
- Feature - Aws::AutoScaling - Adds the `#describe_load_balancers` method,
  and adding the `:load_balancer_names` parameter to the
  `#update_auto_scaling_group` method.
- Feature - Fewer gem dependencies - Removed the dependency on the follow
  two 3rd party gems:
  - `multi_json`
  - `builder`
  
  For JSON parsing and dumping, the SDK will attempt to use the `Oj`
  gem if available, and will fall back on `JSON` from the Ruby
  standard library.
  
  The only remaining gem dependency is `jmespath`.
- Feature - Service Types - Added struct classes for all AWS data types.
  Previous versions used anonymous structure classes for response data.
  
  ```
  Aws::IAM::Types.constants
  #=> [:AccessKey, :AccessKeyLastUsed, :AccessKeyMetadata, ...]
  ```
  
  Each of these data type classes are now fully documented in the
  [api reference docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/index.html).
- Feature - Examples - The API reference documentation can now load client
  operation examples from disk. This allows users to contribute examples
  to the documentation. It also allows for more targeted examples
  than the auto-generated ones previously used.
  
  Examples are stored inside the examples folder at the root of this
  repository. https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/tree/master/examples
- Feature - Documentation - Significant work has gone into API reference
  documentation. The changes made are based on user feedback. Some of
  the many changes include:
  - More concise syntax examples
  - Response structure examples
  - Request and response data structures each documented as their own type
  - Expanded resource interface documentation on inputs and return values
  
  Expect more documentation improvements.
- Feature - Smaller Gem - Reduced the size of the `aws-sdk-core` gem
  by removing the AWS API documentation source files from the gemspec.
  This reduces the total size of the gem by half.
- Feature - Stub Data - Added a `#stub_data` method to `Aws::Client` that
  makes it trivial to generate response data structures.
  
  ```
  s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new
  
  s3.stub_data(:list_buckets)
  #=> #<struct Aws::S3::Types::ListBucketsOutput buckets=[], owner=#<struct Aws::S3::Types::Owner display_name=""DisplayName"", id=""ID"">>
  ```
  
  You can also provide an optional hash of data to apply to the stub.
  The data hash will be validated to ensure it is properly formed and
  then it is applied. This makes it easy to generated nested response
  data.
  
  ```
  s3.stub_data(:list_buckets, buckets:[{name:'aws-sdk'}])
  #=> #<struct Aws::S3::Types::ListBucketsOutput
    buckets=[
      #<struct Aws::S3::Types::Bucket name=""aws-sdk"", creation_date=nil>
    ],
    owner=#<struct Aws::S3::Types::Owner display_name=""DisplayName"", id=""ID"">>
  ```
- Feature - Shared Response Stubs - You can now provide default stubs to a
  client via the constructor and via `Aws.config`. This can be very useful
  if you need to stub client responses, but you are not constructing the
  client.
  
  ```
  Aws.config[:s3] = {
    stub_responses: {
      list_buckets: { buckets: [{name:'aws-sdk'}]}
    }
  }
  
  s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new
  s3.list_buckets.buckets.map(&:name)
  #=> ['aws-sdk']
  ```
  
  See [related GitHub issue aws/aws-sdk-core#187](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby/issues/187)
- Issue - Response Stubbing - When using response stubbing, pagination
  tokens will no longer be generated. This prevents stubbed responses
  from appearing pageable when they are not.
  
  See [related GitHub issue #804](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/804)
- Issue - Aws::DynamoDB::Client - Resolved an issue where it was not
  possible to stub attribute values. You can now stub DynamoDB responses
  as expected:
  
  ```
  ddb = Aws::DynamoDB::Client.new(stub_responses:true)
  ddb.stub_responses(:get_item, item: { 'id' => 'value', 'color' => 'red' })
  ddb.get_item(table_name:'table', key:{'id' => 'value'})
  #=> #<struct Aws::DynamoDB::Types::GetItemOutput item={""id""=>""value"", ""color""=>""red""}, consumed_capacity=nil>
  ```
  
  See [related GitHub issue #770](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/770)
- Feature - SSL Peer Verification - Added a method to configure a default
  SSL CA certificate bundle to be used when verifying SSL peer certificates.
  V1 did this by default, v2 is now opt-in only.
  
  ```
  Aws.use_bundled_cert!
  ```
  
  This method can be very useful for Ruby users on Windows where OpenSSL
  does not tend to have access to a valid SSL cert bundle.
  
  See [related GitHub issue aws/aws-sdk-core#166](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby/issues/166)
- Feature - Eager auto-loading - Added a utility method that eagerly loads
  classes and modules. This can help avoid thread-safety issues with
  autoload affecting some versions Ruby.
  
  ```
  # autoload specific services (faster)
  Aws.eager_autoload!(services: %w(S3 EC2))
  
  # autoload everything
  Aws.eager_autoload!
  ```
  
  See [related GitHub issue #833](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/833)
- Issue - Response Stubbing - Clients with `stub_responses: true` were still
  attempting to load credentials from ENV, and the EC2 instance metadata
  service. Instead, stubbed clients will now construct fake static credentials.
  
  See [related GitHub issue #835](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/835)
- Upgrading - Pageable Responses - Due to frequent confusion caused by
  having every response be decorated as pageable, only operations that can
  possibly have multiple responses are now decorated.
  
  This ensures that if you call `#each` on a non-pageable response that
  an appropriate `NoMethodError` is raised instead of doing nothing. Simply
  remove calls to `#each` if you encounter this unlikely situation.
  
  ```
  s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new
  s3.head_object(bucket:'name', key:'key').each do |page|
  end
  #=> raises NoMethodError for #each, HEAD object is not pageable
  ```
  
  This is correctly reflected now in the API reference documentation as
  well.
- Upgrading - Seahorse::Model - The internal representation of AWS API models
  has been updated. Users digging into internals of the API model will need
  to update their code to deal with shape references.
  
  **This change should not affect users of the public SDK interfaces**.
  
  Complex shapes, structures, lists, and maps, now use shape references
  to nest other shapes. The entire API model now loaded when the service client
  is defined. This eliminates the need to maintain a complex map of all
  shapes and define them lazily. This has allows for massive simplifications
  around API loading, especially when dealing with thread-safety concerns.

  EC2-Classic to EC2-VPC.
- Feature - Aws::Route53Domains - `#check_domain_availability` can now return
  `DONT_KNOW` when a definitive response has not been received from the
  registry, such as during domain registry scheduled maintenance periods.
  UnsupportedTLD is now a potential error from more Route 53 Domains activities.

- Feature - Aws::Glacier - Added support for vault access policies.
- Issue - Aws::IAM - Added the missing pagination configuration for
  `Aws::IAM::Client#list_policies`.
  
  See [related GitHub issue #805](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/805)
- Issue - HTTP Handler - Applied a local fix for a Net::HTTP bug. Net::HTTP
  will retry failed requests when the request method is idempotent, such as
  HTTP GET, PUT, etc. Unfortunately, Net::HTTP will create a new request, but
  yield bytes to the same callback after bytes have already been yielded. This
  causes the response data sink to contain a truncated response, followed
  by a full response.  This results in correct data.
  
  The fix current is to disable idempotent retries until this is fixed upstream.
  
  See [related GitHub issue #799](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/799)
- Feature - Aws::S3::Encryption::Client - You can now pass vanilla
  client constructor options to the encryption client constructor and these
  will pass through when generating the underlying client. This increases
  the parity with the vanilla client.
  
  See [related GitHub issue #800](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/800)
  and [related GitHub issue #801](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/801).
- Feature - Aws::S3 - Added the ability to pass a block to
  `Aws::S3::Encryption::Client#get_object` that yields data as it is
  decrypted. This increases parity with the vanilla `Aws::S3::Client#get_object`
  method.
  
  See [related GitHub issue #794](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/794).
- Issue - Aws::S3 - Resolved an issue were the bucket exists waiter could raise
  when receiving a 301 permanent redirect from Amazon S3. This happens when
  the HEAD request is made against a region different from where the bucket
  exists. Instead this will now cause the `:bucket_exists` waiter to return a
  truthy value and not raise.
  
  See [related GitHub issue #796](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/796).
- Issue - Aws::EC2 - The `:volume_deleted` waiter no longer raises an error on a
  400 `Aws::EC2::Errors::InvalidVolumeNotFound` error. Instead it returns
  with success.
  
  See [related GitHub issue #789](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/789).
- Feature - Aws::S3 - Added a client-side check to ensure HTTP response bodies are
  not truncated before all of the expected bytes have been received. This check is
  performed for all non-HEAD requests where a 'Content-Length' response header is
  present.
  
  When fewer bytes are returned, then the request is retried up to the configured
  `:retry_limit` number limit of attempts. This limit defaults to 3.

  feature that allows developers to run an AWS Lambda function in response to
  important events in Amazon Cognito. The first event supported is the Sync
  Trigger event.

  the Capistrano project.
  
  The `#safe_define_method` is intenteded to ensure the resource methods do
  not conflict with methods of Object, such as `#send`, and `#object_id`.
  These are now tested only in local testing but not at runtime. This allows
  for projects to add functionality to Object without triggering this
  check.

- Upgrading - Aws::Lambda - AWS Lambda is exiting their preview period and has
  made changes to their control plane APIs. If you are invoking methods outside
  of `Aws::Lambda::Client#invoke_async`, you should switch to the
  `Aws::LambdaPreview::Client` until you can upgrade.
  
  ``` ruby
  # returns the stable 2015-03-01 API client
  lambda = Aws::Lambda::Client.new
  
  # returns the preview API client
  lambda = Aws::LambdaPreview::Client.new
  ```
- Feature - Aws::WorkSpaces - Added support for Amazon WorkSpaces.
- Feature - Aws::ECS - You can now use the Amazon ECS Service scheduler to
  manage long-running applications and services. The Service scheduler allows
  you to distribute traffic across your containers using Elastic Load Balancing.
- Feature - Aws::S3 - Added support for resource based permissions for invoking
  Lambda functions via bucket notifications.
- Upgrading - Aws::S3::Client - Deprecated two methods:
  - `Aws::S3::Client#put_bucket_notification`
  - `Aws::S3::Client#get_bucket_notification`
  
  These methods have been replaced by:
  - `Aws::S3::Client#put_bucket_notification_configuration`
  - `Aws::S3::Client#get_bucket_notification_configuration`
  
  The method signatures for the old two methods did not correctly allow users
  to specify multiple topic, queue, and lambda function configurations. The
  new methods, suffixed by `_notification` correct these errors. The new
  methods now also support resource based permissions on notifications to
  lambda functions.
  
  ``` ruby
  s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new
  
  # old
  s3.put_bucket_notification(
    bucket: 'aws-sdk',
    notification_configuration: {
      topic_configuration: { id:'id1', events:[...] },
      queue_configuration: { id:'id2', events:[...] },
      cloud_function_configuration: { id:'id3', events:[...], invocation_role: '...' },
    }
  )
  
  # new
  s3.put_bucket_notification_configuration(
    bucket: 'aws-sdk',
    notification_configuration: {
      topic_configurations: [
        { id:'id1', events:[...] }
      ],
      queue_configurations: [
        { id:'id2', events:[...] }
      ],
      lambda_function_configurations: [
        { id:'id3', events:[...] }
      ]
    }
  )
  ```
  
  Notice the `:lambda_function_configurations` does not take an
  `:invocation_role` and that each of the configuration types now takes
  a list of configurations.
- Feature - Aws::MachineLearning - Added support for Amazon Machine Learning.

- Issue - Xml Parser - Resolved an issue with the recent XML parser update that
  caused bugs when using Nokogiri. Nokogiri will inconsistently trigger one or
  multiple text events for XML elements. This seems to be affected by the total

  The XML parser now supports SAX parsing engines that trigger mulitple text
  events for a single XML element value. Added test where a dummy engine simulates
  this behavior.

  See [related GitHub issue #755](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/755).
- Feature - Resources - Added `#exists?` methods to a handful of resource classes.
  The `#exists?` method works by polling the exists wait for the resource exactly
  once. If the waiter is successful, then `true` is returned, if it fails, then
  `false` is returned.
  
  To add additional `#exists?` methods, a waiter must be added to the resource
  class as `Exists` and that waiter must be defined in the *.waiters.json
  document for that service.
- Issue - Presigned URLs - Resolved an issue where `x-amz-` headers were not

- Issue - Aws::SharedCredentials - Now ignoring trailing whitespace from the

- Upgrading - Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials - Increased the default number of
  attempts to make when loading credentials from the Amazon EC2 instance metadata
  service before failing from 0 to 5. Also increased the default open and read timeouts
  from 1 to 5 seconds each. This increases the reliability of loading instance
  credentials.
  
  **These new defaults only affect users who are constructing `Aws::InstanceProfileCredential`
