---
- Associations
  - Adapter-level support for optimized joins (SQL databases and Mongo)
  - Built-in support for in-memory joins.  Allows for cross-database and even cross-adapter joins! (e.g. a User in Mongo has many Messages in a MySQL database called `legacy_messages`, and also a Role in a MySQL database called `myapp`.  These can be automatically joined together using the same ORM syntax as normal.)
- Better Error Handling in Waterline
- Revamped Sails CLI
  - Generators w/ support for coffeescript
  - Support for dry runs (`--dry`) for `sails generate` and `sails new`
  - Experimental support for custom generators
- API Blueprints
  - Blueprints are injected into project, allowing the built-in API to be customized.
  - Dramatic simplification of how blueprints are injected-- by implicitly including them in the routes file.
  - Backwards compatibility for blueprints on <=v0.9 apps can be achieved by plugging in a simple config to re-enable the traditional support and configurations.
  - Blueprint routes automatically take associations into account, e.g.:
    - `GET /user/2/dogs` -- get dogs belonging to user #2
    - `GET /user/2/dad` -- get dad belonging to user #2
    - `PUT /user/2/dogs` -- add a dog to user #2
    - `DELETE /user/2/dogs/2` -- remove dog #5 from user #2
- PubSub
  - Simplified dramatically- removed concept of class rooms (most of the time, this isn't exactly what you want anyways)
  - Blueprints still work the same way by introspecting your app's schema and taking advantage of information about assocations to create logical publish/subscribe dependencies, relying on the global channel in cases where a shared instance doesn't exist.
  - Reduced to a handful of simple methods:
    - `SomeModel.publish()` -- publish to model instance
    - `SomeModel.subscribe()` -- subscribe socket to model instance
    - `SomeModel.unsubscribe()` -- unsubscribe socket from model instance
    - `sails.publish()` -- publish to global channel
    - `sails.subscribe()` -- subscribe socket to global channel
    - `sails.unsubscribe()` -- unsubscribe socket to global channel
- Error Negotiation Shortcuts
  - Automatically content-negotiate a response-- configurable in `500.js`, `404.js`, `400.js`, `403.js`
  - `res.serverError( msgOrObj )`
  - `res.notFound()`
  - `res.forbidden( msgOrObj )`
  - `res.badRequest( msgOrObj )`
