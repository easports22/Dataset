371004,2014-06-12T14:45:44Z,2014-06-12T15:02:44Z,Gunicorn 19.0 has been released,"Gunicorn 19.0 is a major release with new features and fixes. This version improve a lot the usage of Gunicorn with python 3 by adding [two new workers](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/19.0/design.html#asyncio-workers) to it: `gthread` a fully threaded async worker using futures and `gaiohttp` a worker using asyncio.

## Breaking Changes

### Switch QUIT and TERM signals

With this change, when gunicorn receives a QUIT all the workers are
killed immediately and exit and TERM is used for the graceful shutdown.

Note: the old behaviour was based on the NGINX but the new one is more
correct according the following doc:

https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html

also it is complying with the way the signals are sent by heroku:

### Deprecations

`run_gunicorn`, `gunicorn_django` and `gunicorn_paster` are now completely deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use the `gunicorn` command instead.

## Changes:

### core
- add aiohttp worker named `gaiohttp` using asyncio. Full async worker
  on python 3.
- fix HTTP-violating excess whitespace in write_error output
- fix: try to log what happened in the worker after a timeout, add a
  `worker_abort` hook on SIGABRT signal.
- fix: save listener socket name in workers so we can handle buffered
  keep-alive requests after the listener has closed.
- add on_exit hook called just before exiting gunicorn.
- add support for python 3.4
- fix: do not swallow unexpected errors when reaping 
- fix: remove incompatible SSL option with python 2.6
- add new async gthread worker and `--threads` options allows to set multiple
  threads to listen on connection

- fix: run worker's `setup` method  before setting num_workers

## Notes:

### New versioning:

With this release, the versioning of Gunicorn is changing. Gunicorn is stable since a long time and there is no point to release a ""1.0"" now.  It should have been done since a long time. 0.17 really meant it was the 17th stable version. From the beginning we have only 2 kind of releases:
- major release: releases with major changes or huge features added
- services releases: fixes and minor features added

So from now we will apply the following versioning `<major>.<service>`. For example `17.5` is a service release.
