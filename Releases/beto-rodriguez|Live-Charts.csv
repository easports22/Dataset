### What is next for the library?

* WPF 1.0 will come soon, I am aware of a couple of significant issues in the library, I'll fix before releasing 1.0
* UWP will be updated to support all the features WPF does.
* Documentation will have a considerable review based on the most asked questions I've received along the life of this library.

###  When will it happen?

I am planning to accelerate the process, this moth I will be working hard in the project, ETA to achieve all previous points, 45 days.

<hr/>

Lets go back to this release:

### Braking Changes

 * Sadly in a previous release, Series.PointForeground property was renamed by mistake to Series.PointForeround (notice the missing 'g'), this release fixes this typo error.

### New Features

* This repo now includes the assemblies certificate, this will allow anyone to build a singed copy of LiveCharts by only running build.ps file, yes the same certificate that signs the assemblies in Nuget.
* Labeled Sections, notice it supports 2 modes, in the X axis, the section snaps to the closest point, in the Y axis it just follows the mouse position (Sample [here](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/tree/master/Examples/Wpf/CartesianChart/SectionsMouseMove), will be in the site soon):

![snap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10853349/25369615/d8ed8f3e-294a-11e7-82c4-b1200059525c.gif)

* Advanced coloring rules for financial series, supported in both, LiveCharts and LiveCharts.Geared, a sample will be uploaded to the site soon.

* An experimental new axis thanks to @mirthestam, this axis, changes its labels according to user zooming and panning, changing from years, month, days, hours and seconds. https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/tree/master/Examples/Wpf/CartesianChart/DateAxis

### Fixed issues

* Prevents a possible threading issue https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/commit/faef6696e7415b04634f49721dda9a2da5267ded.
* Fixed an issue where replacing an item in a ChartValues instance was not firing the update automatically https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/commit/29f9f426cb319c204ca75e7a51f5c065b5f2c77b.
* Fixes an issue where scroll bars could get lost when mouse up event was triggered outside the chart https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/commit/ca11434f85f0d3cd7e9ee2339422228b91046884.
* Fixed an issue where nesting a chart inside a Winforms user control could cause the designer to throw https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/commit/7afe71b7a4771b9234ed2c49a1151a2b2e46a19e.
* #499 
* Fixed a visual bug with missing points in a LineSeries https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/commit/d928f17626c5498786800da706a37d3ee29d5a9f
* #515 Windows7/WindowsXP zooming issue

### Extra Notes

* Axis.Separator type changed from IAxisSeparator to LiveCharts.WPF.Separator/LiveCharts.UWP.Separator this should improve developers' experience avoiding an unnecessary cast.

well, tooltips are cleaner now, there was a case ( #229 ) where you needed to wrap your tooltip in a container to make it work properly, this is no longer necessary, tooltips should display correctly always now.

**New Features**
- Now we can disable zooming and enable panning or vise versa
- ChartValues now implements INotifyCollectionChanged and INotifyPropertyChanged, which means this class now updates the UI and not only the chart as it used to for more info see #284

**Fixed issues**
- Fixed an issue where animated zooming was not queuing the request in the updater, this caused the chart to redraw every time we scrolled the mouse wheel, now animated zoom behaves much better.

**Breaking Changes**
- Chart.UpdaterTick delegate changed from `void UpdaterTickHandler()` to `void UpdaterTickHandler(object sender)` where sender is the chart that fired the event.

**New Features**
- Default tooltip for CartesianChart had a considerable visual improvement, it is also much more flexible, the article about tooltips in the site will be updated showing the new features
- Finally one of the ugliest issues (in my opinion) was fixed, series were not able to let the chart know its points size, this caused points to be not completely rendered, see #341 
- You can now bind any event in the library, there will be a new article in the web site about events, listing them all and showing a brief example.
- New Logarithmic Axis, now you can add logarithmic axes with any base to a  cartesian chart.
- Gauges are much more flexible. the site will show a new article with the new gauge capabilities.

This version has small, but braking changes, coming from 0.7.x should not require any change in most of the cases:

**New Features**
- **Welcome UWP** the library is finally in UWP, with some known issues that you can find in the [Issues section](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/issues), the package is already in Nuget: `PM> Install-Package LiveCharts.Uwp`
- **welcome back net 4.0** wrongly I removed support to net 40 in previous versions, well now it is back, the Nuget package contains both builds net4.0 and PCL profile 328 (current one).
- For some reason all the nuget packages missed `.pdb`, and xml docs files, they are now included since 0.8, this in makes the library more friendly to users, by enabling IDE intellisense and a better debugging experience.
- LiveCharts.Geared v1.2 will be released soon, which extends the high performance to all the series in the library (but heat series).
- **new Gantt chart** see an example there -> https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/tree/master/Examples/WinForms/Cartesian/GanttChart
- Wpf themes are included now in the library, they are light and an easy way to get started styling your charts : https://lvcharts.net/App/examples/v1/wpf/Themes

**Major Changes** (don't be scared to update, normally they won't affect your current work)
- Type of `Axis.MinValue` and `Axis.MaxValue` changed from `double?` to `double` to fix incompatibility with UWP, in older version o clear zooming you used to `axis.MinValue = null`, the equivalent in 0.8 is `axis.MinValue = double.Nan`, the example in the web site is already updated to 0.8 API
- `Section.FromValue` and `Section.ToValue` are obsolete and will be replaced in future versions with `Section.Value` and `Section.SectionWidth` to fix a bug with draggable sections, FromValue/ToValue works, but there is no warranty that it will be supported in future versions, if you are using a draggable section please use the new properties instead, the site already contains examples using the new syntax.

I said 0.7.12 would include High performance, sadly not everything is ready yet. the library in general is much more solid to do complex operations, you will notice it, many improvements to zooming, panning, and detected bottlenecks that were reducing performance.

This does not means the library is read to plot millions of points now, I keep working in the virtualization algorithms,  the results are awesome, you can really plot millions in practically no time (depends on the series and chart). These algorithms are practically ready, but before releasing them I need to fix licensing and some other issues, as I have said they will have a price, but you will be able to get a license from 59 USD, this is a really low price compared with any other charting library, this will only help to keep the project alive, pay the web site, improve documentation and support.

Live-Charts will always be free and MIT licensed, this means if you only need what you have being doing so far, you won't need to pay anything to use this library, but when you need a high performance library you could t get the `GearValues` package.

Let's go back to this release

**New Features**:
- New property, `Axis.BarUnit`, it makes much more simpler to work with bars, instead of [changing the unit of the chart](http://lvcharts.net/App/examples/v1/wpf/Date%20Time) as you used to, I will add an example to the web site soon, but the idea is that now you can set the width of a column bar, to 1 second, 1 day, or any unit you need.
- New `Axis.RangeChanged` event, this even is called every time the axis range changes, includes zooming and panning, also will add an example soon.

**Changes**
- The AxisX and AxisY properties are no longer of type `List<Axis>` instead it is a specialized collection the `AxesCollection` type, you would normally don't need to change any part of your code, at least I didn't, only if you were initializing an axis set from code behind, you must change `myChart.AxisX = new List<Axis>()` to `myChart.AxisX = new AxesCollection()` 

**New Features**
- Now you can add any UI element to a chart, this was already supported in older versions, but now it is more MVVM friendly, [here](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/blob/master/Examples/Wpf/CartesianChart/UIElements/UIElementsExample.xaml) is an example 
- Now there is a new property for the default tooltip and default legend, the `BulletSize` property, use it to increase the size of the bullet in both, I also by default increased the size in both, from 11 to 15, it really looks much better, [here](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/issues/199#issuecomment-225273375) is an example.
- Based on #190, you can now custom the padding between each bar series (Rows, Columns and both stacked versions), so now you can build histograms with this library.
- The `Chart.Update()` method is back, it is not recommended to use this method, LiveCharts should ALWAYS update by itself, but there are some specific scenarios where you need to force the updater.

**Fixed Issues**
- #194 Pie Chart was not working in winforms.
- #193 Removing an axis instance, was not removing the drawn shapes of the instance.
- #185 Fixed a bug where DataTooltip was clipped, when the chart was not big enough.
- #195 Fixed a bug where the colors in the gauge where inverted.

3277659,2016-05-22T02:14:44Z,2016-05-22T03:27:21Z,0.7.0 A mature version,"Currently LiveCharts supports most of features that other charting libraries does, with our own benefits, this release integrates correctly all the features included a long the life of the library, I practically reviewed every corner of the code, you must find this version really stable and maintainable, the migration to 0.7.0 should be really easy and should make the library much more easier to use, there are a lot of automatic stuff now.

Everything included in previous versions works, now it is much much more easier!

**What problems does 0.7.0 solves?**
- **Multiplaform**, yes, you will soon see this library in more platforms, now the core of the library is a PCL.
- **1 chart, multiple series**, the only big change in this version is that the `BarChart` or `StackedBarChart` classes are removed, now we only have one chart the `Cartesian Chart` this chart supports all the series in previous versions an many new ones, and yes you can mix any Series.
- **Full Review of the code**, When I made the library portable I had to split all the current code in Model (Core) and View (WPF in this case), this forced me to review ALL the code, you must find a much more solid structure in the library, fixed many old code blocks that are no more necessary, and were causing confusing and repetitive issues.
- **ChartValues&lt;T&gt; now is for real generic.** Forget about the configuring a type to plot it, the library already knows how to plot many types, you could also plot any custom type as in previous versions. 
- **Easier Configuration** When you really need to plot a custom class then configuring it is much easier, [here](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/blob/master/Core/Charting.cs) You know only need to configure the type once, then the library will use this config everywhere in you application, you can override this config for specific cases, as you used to in previous versions.

**Migration from older versions**

It should be easier, many things changed but most of them internally, you should find the migration to 0.7 pretty easy.
I don't remember remember If I renamed any property (I am sorry this was a HUGE release), but I think I didn't, please let me know if you are facing any troubles besides these ones migrating to 0.7.0
- No more BarChart, StackedBarChart, now we only have one chart CartesianChart, this chart supports all the old series and much more!
- Now the nuget package `Install-Package LiveCharts` contains only the core of the library, you must also install the platform view for example for wpf `Install-Package LiveCharts.Wpf`
  - `SeriesConfiguration` class is now obsolete and will be removed in future versions, instead use `LiveCharts.Configurations.Mappers` class, it contains a list of configurators, the equivalent to `SeriesConfigurations` class is `Mappers.Xy`.
- `Hoverable` property is now obsolete, and will be removed in future versions, if you need to disable the tooltip, instead set a null tooltip, `Chart.DataTooltip = null;`
- `Chart.XCursor` is much better, instead there is a new property in the axis `Axis.Sections`, you can highlight one or many value ranges, [here](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/blob/f055a6ae62196f6656481978ae654461f879b82e/Examples/Wpf/CartesianChart/SectionsExample.xaml) is an example.

**New Features**
- High Frequency updates
- BubbleSeries
- StackedArea Series
- OhclSeries (Financial Series)
- All Stacked Series have a new property `StackMode`, the options are Values or Percentage.
- PieSeries has a new property, the `PushOut` property allows you to highlight a pie slice.
- New Gauge control
- Now the axis have a new property, Axis.Sections, it is an array of `Section` class, you can highlight value ranges

**Fixed Issues**
- #92 Unknown point (Double.Nan) and line charts fails when you change a point from double.nan to double
- #105 Chart not drawing when I do constant changes in a short period or time (less than 100ms).
- #91 Live changes failing sometimes (not sure when already) 
- #132  When char width is too smal error jump up. I'm about Basic Line 
- #145 LineChart, first point start a bezier line from 0.0

0.6.6 finally caches every object, it never deletes and adds a new object as previous versions used to, this is taking LiveCharts to a new level, performance should be drastically improved, and animations run much better since we always animate from where the chart was in the previous frame.

**New Features**
1. multi axes charts from #21, even the declaration of the AxisX and AxisY property changed the XAML syntax should work as in previous versions, if you set an Axis from code behind then you will need to change your code. You can find examples at https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/tree/master/WPFExamples/Line%20Examples/InLine or https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/tree/master/WPFExamples/BarExamples/MultiAxesBarChart or  http://lvcharts.net/#/examples/v1/multipleAxes-wpf?path=WPF-MultipleAxes (final link could not be updated yet), **Note:** The Chart.Axis property changed its definition, from `public Axis AxisX {get;set;}` to `public List<Axis> AxisX {get;set;}` conciser this if you are some how manipulating the axes in code behind eg: `chart.AxisX = new List<Axis> { new Axis() };`
2. Introduced some new properties to handle multi axes charts, **1)** use the `Series.ScalesYAt` or `Series.ScalesXAt` to indicate that a series uses certain axis. **2)**us the `Series.CurrentXAxis` or `Series.CurrentYAxis` to get the current axis of a series.
3. You can now custom yous axis positioning, no mater if you have 1 or 10 axes you could specify where the axis is stacked (Top/Right or Bot/Left), use the `Axis.Position` property to custom this.

1. You can now ""merge"" axes to the plot area, this will save some space, also will make your charts look more math style, just set the `Axis.IsMerged` property to True, the image to the left shows a merged axis vs a normal axis(right)

![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10853349/14399794/dfda95b0-fdb5-11e5-8504-6df683434e1b.png)
1. yo can now place multi lines labels for more info see #99 
2. You have now more control over series, some properties extra properties are directly binded to the Drawn shape, for example in any series set Panel.ZIndex property, this way you will be able to control the Z order of your chart, for more info see #107 
3. All series stroke can be dashed now, for more info see #116 
4. Added the new Chart.TooltipTimeout property so yo can custom the duration of a tooltip when the user leaved the data point. please see #118 
5. Axes are now animated, when the chart grows or reduces it values range you will see how the chart animates this.

**Fixed Bugs**

#104, #98, #106, #100, #108, #102, #101

new web site with better examples and documentation

**Major Changes**
- Removed LineType property, instead there is a new property called LineSmoothness which gives you more control over the line, it goes from 0 (rect lines) to 1 (really curved line).
- When Implementing IObservableChartPoint, renamed event ValueChanged to PointChanged
- Renamed chart.Redraw() to Chart.Update()
- Renamed Chart.UnsafeRedraw() to Chart.UnsafeUpdate()
- Renamed Axis.Thickness to Axis.StrokeThickness
- Pie Chart now supports multiple series, please see new examples, 0.6.4 syntax will not work as you expect, pie chart is also more concistent and should work the same as all charts now.

**New Features**
- Now live charts handle obvervable points, this means you can update your chart when a property changes, see example here https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/tree/master/WPFExamples/BarExamples/UsingObservableChartPoint
- Now Series have a new property called `DataLables` set it to true when you need in line labels, example:

- New `DefaultAxes` class, now it is easier to create a new class from XAML, see https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/blob/master/WPFExamples/Line%20Examples/IrregularIntervals/IrregularLine.xaml

**Fixed Bugs**
- Added new UnitTests, this should help with more stable future versions
- Added more support to PieCharts with #81 #85 #80 also better examples for pie charts.
- #84 Now you can change Series Visibility
- now all charts are more stable, added unit testing project and removed many double.NaN bugs from all charts.

- Now you don’t plot an `ObservableCollection<double>`, instead you plot `ChartValues<T>` where `T` is anything you need, Tooltips also can display `T` instead of a double value,  This is an awesome feature I am really glad with the result, see an example here: https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/tree/master/ChartsTest/Line%20Examples/Mvvm.
- Default Namespace changed for simplicity in XAML from `LiveChart` to `lvc`
- You can safely remove SeriesCollection wrapper needed for 0.5.9 and 0.5.10
- Pie chart now support tooltip by default.
- Implemented many specialized classes that might help in a future (and now) with performance, stability and scalability for example  `ChartValues`,  `SeriesCollection`,  `ChartPoint`
- Renamed PrimaryValues to Values, SecondaryValues for scatter chart dissapear, now ScatterChart uses by default `ChartValues<Point>`.
- Renamed PrimaryAxis to AxisY and SecondaryAxis to AxisX.
- Visual update to animations and default colors so charts by default are more beautiful now :)

**Migration from previous versions**
- Chage all `ObservableCollection<double>` to `ChartValues<double>`, this will help you to run the code, but also concider reading the new documentation since LiveCharts is more powerful now.
- Change `ObservableCollection<Series>` to `SeriesCollection`
- Change PrimaryValues to Values
- Remove SecondaryValues from ScatterCharts, and set the values of ScatterSeries to `ChartValues<Point>`, or in line charting new XAML syntax  `Values=""[0, 0], [45, .7071], [90, 1]""`
- Rename PrimaryAxis to AxisY and SecondaryAxis to AxisX
- you can safely remove XAML SeriesCollection wrapper from previous verison

Before Installing 0.5.9  you could need to make some changes to your XAML, where you used this sintax:

**From**

``` xml
<liveCharts:LineChart Name=""Chart"" Grid.Row=""1"" Grid.Column=""0"">
            <liveCharts:LineChart.Series>
                    <liveCharts:LineSeries Title=""Maria"" PrimaryValues=""20, 40, 45, 60, 55, 60, 65, 70"" />
                    <liveCharts:LineSeries Title=""John"" PrimaryValues=""30, 35, 43, 68, 65 ,70, 55, 60"" />
            </liveCharts:LineChart.Series>
        </liveCharts:LineChart>
```

**To**

``` xml
<liveCharts:LineChart Name=""Chart"" Grid.Row=""1"" Grid.Column=""0"">
            <liveCharts:LineChart.Series>
                <liveCharts:SeriesCollection>
                    <liveCharts:LineSeries Title=""Maria"" PrimaryValues=""20, 40, 45, 60, 55, 60, 65, 70"" />

                </liveCharts:SeriesCollection>
            </liveCharts:LineChart.Series>
        </liveCharts:LineChart>
```

Notice the new `SeriesCollection` wrapper, it is nothing but a class that inherits from `ObservableCollection<Series>`, we need to hard code this instance so wpf can track each chart `Series` correctly.
