7957995,2017-10-02T00:26:03Z,2017-10-02T00:28:21Z,0.5.14  Faster loading for complex dependency trees,"Figwheel inherited a topo sort algorithm from the CLJS compiler. It
turned out that this graph sorting algorithm missed a very important
optimization, which is fixed in this release. If you have project that
has a lot of namespaces and have experienced slower load times when
you change a file that is deeper in your dependency chain, you should
notice a big improvement when using this release.

Added JavaScript environment hooks for tools like `re-natal` to
customize the websocket implementation and the script loading behavior.

* improved topo-sort algorithm
* CLJS compile option: the `:entries` key is no longer required in the
  `:modules` configs
* new `:repl-eval-timeout` allows you to increase or lower the
  Figwheel REPL eval timeout as a top level config setting
* added `goog.global.FIGWHEEL_WEBSOCKET_CLASS` to allow one to
  override or supply a websocket implementation for the figwheel
  client
* added `goog.global.FIGWHEEL_IMPORT_SCRIPT` to allow one to override
  or supply a function to the figwheel client, that is responsible for
  loading a namespace into the JavaScript runtime.
* added two new namespaces that can be supplied the ClojureScript
  compiler's `:preloads` option.
  
  The two namespaces are only different in that one set's up figwheel
  while the other both sets up and starts figwheel. These are
  currently meant to clean up how the figwheel client is injected into
  the build. The next release of Figwheel will do away with generating
  a small ClojureScript file to inject the Figwheel client into build.
  - `figwheel.connect` which will take a configuration from
    `:external-tooling` > `:figwheel/config` and supply a
    `figwheel.connect/start` function which contains the supplied
    config options. This function is exported so that it can be easily
    called from JavaScript.
  - `figwheel.preload` which simply calls the above `figwheel.connect/start`

- ! removed compojure as a dependency
  Figwheel used compojure in its server to handle routing
  this was overkill. It complicated the routing while adding an unneeded dependency.
  Strange things where happening when `wrap-reload` was being used in an
  embedded `:ring-handler`.  
  There is so little routing functionality in figwheel that I just created
  what was needed with simple ring middleware. If the behavior of your
  :ring-handler changes (routes not being resolved, bad headers etc.)
  please let me know.  For reference here is the commit:

  its now here to stay.

#### Improved the expressiveness of (start-figwheel!)

before `(start-figwheel!)` only optionally took a configuration. Now it
takes optional build-ids as well.

So you can do this:

```
(start-fighweel! ""dev"" ""admin"")
```

And it will pull in the config from the environment and start
autobuilding the supplied build ids.

Or you can supply a config and build ids ...

```
(start-fighweel!
  {:figwheel-options {:server-port 4000}
   :all-builds [{:id ...}]}
   ""dev"" ""admin"")
```

I have also beefed up the error checking and feedback around this call.

#### Code context in Errors and Warnings

This means you will see the compile errors and warnings displayed
along with the offending code and a pointer to the position of the
failure. This is a fairly big improvement. I've found that even for
simple errors that I've become accustomed to, the new errors tend to
beam the information in much more quickly.

The code pointers are rough at times and no code context information
will displayed if Figwheel doesn't get any line and column information
from the compiler.

The display of these errors can still be improved further, and I plan
to do so.  I just wanted to get the bits hooked up and a decent
display out the door first.

Please see the CHANGES.md file, there are a lot of improvements....
