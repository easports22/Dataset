5939126,2017-03-31T16:46:14Z,2017-03-31T17:27:56Z,0.6.0-beta1,"# 0.6.0-beta Release Notes

## Bosun

The main goal of Bosun 0.6.0 was to smooth out the alert creation and editing workflow. Previously, users would have to copy the configuration from Bosun's UI, get it to the server, and then restart the process. Now users can edit the config directly from Bosun's UI, and the changes will be loaded without restarting the bosun process. Since the rules can now be edited via Bosun's UI, authorization via LDAP and SSL support has been added as well.

### Major Changes:

 - Bosun's configuration file has been split into two files: 
    - [RuleConf](https://bosun.org) which contains all definitions.
    - [System configuration](https://bosun.org/system_configuration).
 - Bosun's [RuleConf](https://bosun.org/definitions) can now be [edited via Bosun's UI](https://bosun.org/usage#definition-rule-saving). The changes can then be reloaded without restarting the Bosun process.
 - Bosun now has support for [authorization](https://bosun.org/admin#authentication) via LDAP and Tokens that can be configured via the [auth section of the system configuration](https://bosun.org/system_configuration#authconf).
 - Bosun's dashboard loads much faster than 0.5.0 due to schema change
 - Many [errors can now be handled in templates](https://bosun.org/definitions#template-error-handling) making them more robust against runtime errors, and [template documentation](https://bosun.org/definitions#templates) has been improved.

### Upgrading
 - Since the configuration file has been split, you will need to move some of what used be in the config into [system configuration](https://bosun.org/system_configuration).
 - On the first execution, a database schema migration will take place that can take several minutes. During this time bosun will not be available. It is recommended to back up Bosun's database before the upgrade.

### Other Changes
 - New Expression Functions:
   - [`timedelta`](https://bosun.org/expressions#timedeltaseriesset-seriesset)
   - `esnot`, `esexists`, and `esmonthly` [elastic functions](https://bosun.org/expressions#elastic-query-functions)
   - [`crop`](https://bosun.org/expressions#cropseries-seriesset-start-numberset-end-numberset-seriesset)
   - [`tail`](https://bosun.org/expressions#tailseriesset-num-numberset-seriesset)
   - [`map`](https://bosun.org/expressions#mapseries-seriesset-subexpr-numbersetexpr-seriesset) [#1813](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/pull/1813).
   - [`addtags`](https://bosun.org/expressions#addtagsseriesset-group-string-seriesset)
   - [`leftjoin`](https://bosun.org/expressions#leftjointagscsv-string-datacsv-string-numberset-table)
   - `antable`, `ancounts`, and `andurations` [annotation functions](http://bosun.org/expressions#annotation-query-functions).
   - [`remove`](https://bosun.org/expressions#removeseriesset-string-seriesset)
 - New Template Functions / Variables: `notNil`, `.LastError`, and `.Errors`
 - Comments are now allowed in the Expression Page in Bosun's UI.
 - Bosun's navbar now shows if quiet mode is enabled.
 - Notes can now be added to incidents.
 - Improved Bosun's incident view.
 - Improved Bosun's graph page to be more keyboard friendly: better order of fields with the TAB key and shift-enter within text fields will execute.
 - Updated Influx library to be compatible with current versions.
 - Optimized elastic query performance by not fetching indices and fix bug caused by indices not being part of the cache key [#1931](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/pull/1931).
 - Fixed issue in scheduler where adjacent runs would be given the same to represent ""now"" [#2029](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/pull/2029).
 - Allow the empty tagset to be a dependency for alerts that have tags [#2027](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/pull/2027).
 - Adjustments to Bosun's UI to make it more vertically compact.
 - Fixed HTTP template funcs to have a shorter timeout so they don't block template rendering for too long when they timeout.
 - Allow empty tagsets in silence silence: allow empty tag sets [#1860](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/pull/1860).
 
 ### Expected Changes Between Beta and 0.6.0 final:
  - Tooling outside of the Bosun process doesn't have auth support (except for the Grafana Plugin). The following will have auth support before final: scollector, (cli tools: annotate, silence), tsdbrelay, BosunReporter.NET, and Opserver.
  - Support for multiple Elastic backends in a single instance may be added. If this happens the syntax for the system configuration (toml file) of elastic might change.

## Bosun

This is our first non-preview release in 9 months and includes significant changes since 0.4.0. Future releases should be at a quicker pace since this release involved a complete refactor of Bosun's internal storage.
- We have moved Bosun's internal storage from purely in-memory (that was seralized to bolt) to redis/ledis and refactored the code to be more incident based. In 0.4.0 the dashboard could take 10-30 seconds to load at times. It now should not take more than a second under normal conditions, and should be even faster in a future release. This also results in faster startup times for Bosun and other performance improvements
- Deprecated the logstash queries and replaced them with more generic [elastic functions](http://bosun.org/expressions#elastic-query-functions). This supports different time formats, index naming schemes, and adds more search possibilities
- Added support for basic [series operations](http://bosun.org/expressions#series-operations). Before with seriesSets you could only use operators on them by combining them with scalars or numberSets. Now you can do operations like `q(..) * q(...)`
- Added various functions to the expression language: 
  - [merge](http://bosun.org/expressions.html#mergeseriesset-seriesset), [shift](http://bosun.org/expressions.html#shiftseriesset-dur-string-seriesset), and [over](http://bosun.org/expressions.html#overquery-string-duration-string-period-string-num-scalar-seriesset): Combines series sets, shift the time, show time over time graphs querying OpenTSDB
  - [series](http://bosun.org/expressions.html#seriestagset-string-epoch-value--seriesset): Manually construct a series -- useful for testing and drawing lines on graphs
  - [month](http://bosun.org/expressions.html#seriestagset-string-epoch-value--seriesset): Get the start of the calendar month, useful for alerts that follow the calendar such as bandwidth billing
  - [tod](http://bosun.org/expressions.html#todscalar-string): Turns a number into a duration string, so you can do your query durations based on duration math
  - [linelr](http://bosun.org/expressions.html#linelrseriesset-d-duration-seriesset): Draws a line to visualize the result of forecastlr
- Support for [OpenTSDB 2.2 filters](http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/user_guide/query/filters.html) which allow you to aggregate a subset of tagvalues for a tagkey.
- Added [annotations](http://bosun.org/usage#annotations) to Bosun which are stored in Elastic (designed to possibly support other backends in the future). Bosun annotations have a start and end time, so you can use them to capture outages and maintenance windows
- Added Grafana integration via the new [Bosun Grafana Plugin](https://grafana.net/plugins/bosun-app)
- Added a route for [OpServer](https://github.com/opserver/Opserver) integration (Preview)
- Added bar graphs to the expression page when the result is a numberSet
- Added forceClose and Purge [actions](http://bosun.org/usage#actions)
- Improved incident filters (now supports `AND`, `OR`, `!`, and `()` grouping) 

### Upgrading

Before upgrading to this version, you should decide if you want to use a dedicated redis instance (recommended for production use), or the embedded ledisdb instance (default behavior). Instructions for configuring redis/ledis can be found on our [website](http://bosun.org/configuration#data-storage). The first time bosun starts up with this version, it will migrate all data from the old boltdb file into the new redis store. After that the bolt file should not be needed any more. You should back up your bolt state file before doing this operation, and note that it may take several minutes for Bosun to start while it does the migration.

### Breaking Changes you need to be aware of
- When using OpenTSDB 2.2, wildcard expansion in queries is now done by OpenTSDB instead of Bosun. This is cleaner and results in better performance, but mixing wildcards and alternation is no longer supported until OpenTSDB supports it. For example `*foo*|*baz*`. Bosun will _not_ warn you about this so if you are using this alerts may silently fail. Be sure to look for these in your config before upgrading.
- The graphite backend now rejects tags that are not valid Bosun tags (which have the same [restrictions as OpenTSDB tags](http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/user_guide/writing.html#metrics-and-tags)) since some of them would cause panics. The restrictions are ""Only the following characters are allowed: a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, -, _, ., / or Unicode letters"". Some graphite based alerts may require updating

### In Progress for Future Release
- Config reloading without requiring the bosun process to be restarted
- (Experiment) Last data available through the expression language so some alerts could still work if opentsdb is down
- (Experiment) Working with distributions in addition to series (i.e. histograms)
- Better post notifications

## scollector
- New collectors:
  - systemd service collector
  - varnish
  - Oracle
  - status.io pages 
  - Fastly api stats
  - Extrahop
  - Elastic v2
  - Google Analytics collector
  - Nexpose collector
  - Cisco IOS BGP information (via snmp)
  - Fortinet SNMP collector
  - cadvisor
  - Support for MSSQL Named Instances
- Add a local listener so datapoints can be pased to scollector via http
- Bad datapoints in a batch no longer invalidate the entire batch
- Better filtering options for excluding collectors and/or specific metrics

## TSDBRelay
- Added  ""external counters"" for infrequent or sporadic metrics. These are counters that can receive increments from multiple sources.

## redis migration:

Bosun's internal data storage has been converted from purely in-memory to redis. If you still desire a standalone mode, it will fallback to a ledisdb instance hosted in-proc. For configuration details see [the docs](https://bosun.org/configuration#redis). Data will be migrated from the state file when you first run this release. Make sure your desired config is established before running. Data will not be deleted from bolt.

## redis migration:

Bosun's internal data storage has been converted from purely in-memory to redis. If you still desire a standalone mode, it will fallback to a ledisdb instance hosted in-proc. For configuration details see [the docs](https://bosun.org/configuration#redis). Data will be migrated from the state file when you first run this release. Make sure your desired config is established before running. Data will not be deleted from bolt.
