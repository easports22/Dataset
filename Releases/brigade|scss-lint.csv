Plugins allow anyone to create linters and distribute them to others, which is useful for linters that are specific to a particular framework or development style. See the [README](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint#custom-linters) for details on how to write custom linters.

A big thanks to @cih for implementing the support for plugins.

### New Features
- Add support for loading custom linters via the `plugin_directories` and
  `plugin_gems` configuration options (experimental)
- Add `ExtendDirective` linter which checks for any usage of the `@extend`
  directive.
- Add `TrailingWhitespace` linter which reports whitespace characters at the
  end of a line
- Add `SpaceAfterVariableName` linter which checks that there are no spaces
  between a variable name and a colon

### Changes
- Change `NameFormat` to no longer check placeholder names, as this is handled
  by the `SelectorFormat` linter
- Change `NestingDepth` to allow parent selectors to be ignored in depth count
  via the `ignore_parent_selectors` configuration option

### Bug Fixes
- Fix `ColorVariable` from crashing when variable interpolation occurs in
  multiline comments
- Fix `PropertySortOrder`'s `ignore_unspecified: false` behavior to not care
  about the relative order of unspecified properties at the end of a list of
  properties
- Fix `PropertyUnits` for properties that have multiple unit-like values (e.g.
  shorthand properties) and quoted values
- Fix control comment processing for `FinalNewline`, `SpaceBetweenParens`, and

- Fix `ElsePlacement` to lint nested `@if` statements

**The `scss-lint` gem name has been changed to `scss_lint`**
_(i.e. the dash has been changed to an underscore)_

Practically speaking, this means you only change the name you use in your `Gemfile` or when you install via `gem install ...`. Everywhere else, the tool is still spelt with a dash (including the executable name).

**Why was the name changed?**

The name was changed to follow RubyGems [conventions for naming gems](http://guides.rubygems.org/name-your-gem/), which can eliminate a source of confusion for those who are used to following those conventions. `scss-lint` was given its original gem name before the existence of this document was known.

### New Features
- Add `allowed_shorthands` option for `Shorthand` linter
- Add `allowed` option to `Comment` linter specifying regex of allowed
  multi-line comments, such as copyright notices
- Add `min_properties` option to `PropertySortOrder` to allow specifying a
  threshold number of properties that must be present before linting occurs
- Add `one_space_or_newline` `style` option to `SpaceAfterPropertyColon`

### Changes
- Change configuration loading behavior so that defining lists in a custom
  configuration will completely override the old list instead of adding to it
- Rename `scss-lint` gem to `scss_lint` to follow RubyGems [conventions for
  naming gems](http://guides.rubygems.org/name-your-gem/). This only affects
  the name you use in `Gemfile`s or when you `gem install`; everything else
  remains the same.

### Bug Fixes
- Fix `DeclarationOrder` linter to report lints for items within media queries
- Fix bug where control comments could filter out lints from other files
  depending on scan order
- Ignore `currentColor`, `inherit`, and `transparent` values in
  `VariableForProperty`
- Fix `PropertySortOrder` to lint sort order of nested properties

- Fix bug where SassScript selectors referring to the current selector would
  result in a crash
- Fix bug in `EmptyLineBetweenBlocks` linter where lint would incorrectly be
  reported when comments immediately followed the closing brace of a rule set
- Fix bug in `PropertySortOrder` where properties within media queries were
  not checked for sort order

Tools that use the exit status of the `scss-lint` executable should be aware that the status code for failure has changed from `65` to `2`. This was due to the new feature of reporting a different status code when only warnings are reported, versus when errors are reported. Since there was no [semantic exit code](http://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=3&topic=sysexits) to differentiate warnings from errors, `65` split into `1` and `2`, respectively. See [Exit Status Codes](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint#exit-status-codes) for a full list of status codes.

This release also bumps the minimum required `sass` version to 3.3.7, since this fixes a bug in the upstream Sass parser that fixes issue https://github.com/causes/scss-lint/issues/151.

### New Features
- Add `severity` option allowing the severity level of a lint to be configured
- Include linter name in lint description
- Add `character` option to `Indentation` linter which allows specifying
  tabs or spaces as the indentation character of choice
- Add `SingleLinePerProperty` linter which checks that properties each reside
  on their own line
- Add support to `PropertySortOrder` to specify a preset sort order via the
  `order` property
- Add [`concentric`](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2011/concentric-css/) preset
  sort order to the `PropertySortOrder` linter
- Add `ignore_unspecified` option to `PropertySortOrder` to indicate that
  unspecified properties in custom sort orderings are to be ignored (i.e. they
  can appear anywhere)
- Add `ignore` option to `Compass::PropertyWithMixin` linter allowing you to
  not warn for certain properties
- Add `ignored_names` option to `CapitalizationInSelector`, allowing you to
  whitelist certain names as not needing to follow the convention
- Add `ignored_types` option to `CapitalizationInSelector`, allowing you to
  selectively ignore capitalization in certain types of selectors
- Add `UnnecessaryParentReference` linter which checks nested selectors for
  extraneous parent references
- Teach `TrailingSemicolon` to report lints for uses of `@extend`, `@include`,
  or variable declarations without semicolons

### Changes
- Change CLI to return exit code of `1` if only warnings are reported, or `2`
  if any errors are reported (was previously `65` for either)
- Update `sass` dependency to require 3.3.7 or later (fixes a parsing bug)
- Include test files in gem distribution
- Rename `TrailingSemicolonAfterPropertyValue` to `TrailingSemicolon`

### Bug Fixes
- Fix bug in `SpaceBeforeBrace` linter where an erroneous lint would
  be reported for a brace on its own line
- Fix bug in `SpaceAfterComma` where trailing spaces followed by a newline after
  a comma would incorrectly report a lint
- Fix `SingleLinePerSelector` to ignore any selectors that contain interpolation
