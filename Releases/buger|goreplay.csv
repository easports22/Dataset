## CHANGELOG

### Major
* **[PRO]** Added S3 input and output https://github.com/buger/goreplay/wiki/%5BPRO%5D-Using-S3-for-storing-and-replaying-traffic
* Added new NodeJS middleware framework https://github.com/buger/goreplay/tree/master/middleware
* Add Kafka input and output https://github.com/buger/goreplay/wiki/Streaming-from-and-to-Apache-Kafka
* Improve accuracy of replay by using timestamp of when TCP packet was received by network interface (previously used time of package capture by GoReplay)
* Using `—prettify-http` option, you can automatically decode Gzip encoded responses, and de-construct chunked bodies.
* Now you can enable HTTP response tracking by providing `—output-http-track-respose`. Previously was available only if middleware is turned on.

### Minor
* Add new option `--input-raw-expire` to configure TCP message expiration
* Filter response if its request was filtered
* Allow space inside filters syntax: `--http-disallow-header 'Host: www.vertaa.fi' now valid syntax
* File name pattern now support request id `%r`, will log each request to separate file, and `%t` for payload type (0 - request, 1 - response, 2 - replayed response).
* Add basic SNI support to support HTTP replay to hosts that require SNI, such as Amazon API Gateway.
API Gateway)
* Fix `--output-file-size-limit` option
* Do not add port to Host header #383
* Improve malformed TCP packet handling to avoid panics
* Fix HTTP timeout for 204 (No content) responses
* Fix handling of HTTP error codes like 400 or 304.
