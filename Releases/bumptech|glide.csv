7979864,2017-10-03T14:38:38Z,2017-10-03T16:13:34Z,Glide 4.2.0,"This is the September release of Glide.

## Features
* Added support for replacing Glide's default ``Encoders`` (03f5bd4098489d3c76644ebc014f81bab371dd54, #2349, thanks to @MistaGreen)
* Added a more advanced way to control how/when requests are restarted when they have the same cache keys (b667cab8d3e384ab6f127aef83eafe631d210fd0, thanks to @Tolriq). 
* Repackaged Glide's annotation processor dependencies to avoid build errors with the generated API caused by dependency conflicts (a0e388e234919cb4c94ea391811b5314ac5a9654, #2059, thanks to @TWiStErRob)
* Added a bucketing system when registering custom components to make choosing the order in which the components are called easier and more intuitive (da90633b91e817603bb25589b6589654926caea7, thanks to asuszek@).
* Pass ``Options`` to ``ResourceTranscoders`` to allow customizing behavior (134870e51e362f1648a607348ebb7cb9c51d0a8a, #2417).
* Added an interface to allow reporting or uncaught exceptions on Glide's thread pools (a1cd3afcc41da72885f4da385b53d71601d0d407, thanks to @stephanenicolas)

## Bug fixes
* Fixed incorrect Bitmap pool sizes on some versions of Android (fe5289d23c39fc6a4d48b092ad3fc71f84cc81f9, #2334, thanks to @SUPERCILEX)
* Fixed a resource leak when following redirects in Glide's default Http library (7f625977e740e0278224a96e6b962c2afd286b38, 73a8054f2bc4833598426ba5b09c243b21f752f3, #2352)

* Fixed load failures due to a simultaneous put exception in Glide's default disk cache (01f5a3d3dc0e78cc83b9e390b331a65dd5c1a9f3)
* Fixed Http load failures caused by unexpected characters in the user agent of some devices (3cd06858313ebe28b4a14384fd087eddcece68ab)
* Worked around an O specific ClassCastException in the OkHttp support library (a4af922db56c928a56bcb8bfc7651e32fe10fd10)
* Fixed logic in ``RequestFutureTarget`` to better match the ``Future`` documentation (f033e9b45192a8a9521eca8160edbea2bb741f63) 
* Fixed a few rounding issues when downsampling and transforming images to eliminate hardware bitmap errors and wasteful allocations when decoded Bitmaps from ``Downsampler`` are ~1 pixel off of the size required by ``Transformations`` (f5ba3740fc7d4ad4918a88d84ab55921173543bf, b1b024ebced1e6aef74062cfd04f67d1ca4aa8f5, 4b5ccaa84ad6f7d1e3ab63e6c678ab2d857aaf5d)
* Fix ``get(View)`` failing to find non-support ``Fragments`` (a0c5af1af736a06bdeee78f13de9bd7a072dc3b5)
* Add better null handling to ``ListPreloader`` (c3479c43461404de36c0fd07a5f324573443e193, #2379)
* Fixed assertions when generated ``GlideRequests`` were used to load a model and then modified after the load was started (d56e08cc020269360452c7caabc35565723986f8). 
* Fixed load failures on some devices where UUIDs initialization is broken (d67ce32fcdac66a219eb03838a8d75ffd890cd28, #1510) 
* Improved performance loading video frames slightly be avoiding duplicate ``setDataSource`` calls (a84deb3f6a0bff59b967cf1f2eb8d8c80d805ac2). 
* Handle all types of exceptions thrown by ``ResourceDecoders`` to allow other registered ``ResourceDecoders`` to run even if one decoder fails or behaves unexpectedly (6cffaabcf7e67f59801cc4238a38ec1a88720767). 
* Fixed an exception using ``HARDWARE`` Bitmaps with images where Glide is unable to determine the original dimensions (f9757a5a51c253d4732cea657e968f9918fbed64). 
* Fixed an issue where sometimes the MediaStore thumbnail would be returned when ``Target.SIZE_ORIGINAL`` was used (45013968bf451ac3219febd6f0794321916e62c0, thanks to asuszek@). 

## Documentation
* Added links to a Simplified Chinese translation of Glide's documentation page (ee557b62a6aed1b365a21e33acbe2e9c0e0580c4, thanks to @Muyangmin)
* Added Google's maven repo for support libraries to the setup example in the readme (3bf2d36175cce7f11bc579c94e99dde113b85144, thanks to @rocboronat)

## Behavior changes
* Calling ``into()`` or ``clear()`` in a ``RequestListener`` or ``Target`` implementation will now always crash with an assertion. Previously it would sometimes crash depending on how the request was configured. To avoid the exception, you can use [``Handler#post``][1] to post your ``into()`` or ``clear()`` call to the main thread instead of calling it directly (6fb87b357803b1ca5b34ac046ac01e0fdb88ab16, #2413)
* Glide's interpretation of View sizes has changed substantially, see #2431 for more details.
* Changed the default downsample strategy to ``CENTER_OUTSIDE`` on KitKat+ for cases where neither a strategy nor a transformation that uses a strategy is applied to a load (8a90f542145f82f51fb8b7718f2a5c3fd9ce1bb9, thanks to asuszek@).

* Clarified nullability of properties in ``DataFetcher`` (#2203, thanks to @Tolriq)

## Features
* Removed the BitmapPool by default from low ram devices on O+ and decreased the default BitmapPool size on O+ (bb5c391a8b418f8ac2296d4d2c2ca24110e83984)
* Added support for [``Bitmap.Config.HARDWARE``][7] in Android O+.
 See note below for behavior changes. (d83de421024882311c0aa4d835c8fce6a0550f8a)
* Expose the entry count to subclasses of [``LruCache``][8] (a2a695f11e0a486337c8d0010a997ad536f6a565, thanks to @loran)
* Target Android API 26 (cea1cce41649602e4d3d3490303ea132c75f0332)

* Avoid restarting in progress or completed requests if the new request is identical to the old one (9d10097e7bd298cc5b393364663fa0cf08711e8e, 73a8e0116a7826b631775f42f9a04aad374f3bb8, 0a44cf60135e67e64bc4027ebe70f9acac6f7962, thanks to @Tolriq)
* Added a [new shortcut method][13] for applying multiple transformations (#2138, thanks to @realdeadfish)

## Build changes
* Updated to Gradle 4.1 (0310656a6686ea1988c10dad3a9b14d24c4356da, thanks to @jaredsburrows)

## API/Behavior changes:
1. After 9d10097e7bd298cc5b393364663fa0cf08711e8e, if you attempt to start a request that is exactly the same as the request already in progress for a given ``View`` or [``Target``][14], your new request will be ignored and the old request will be allowed to complete. If you need to override this behavior, you can do so by manually calling [``clear()``][15] on the ``View`` or [``Target``][14] before starting your new load. Consider filing an issue if you encounter a problem with this feature.
2. After 06aced3fd95a6339f30a8d611be81fbb2169b0d1, Glide will always use a [``TransitionDrawable``][16] to run the cross fade transition. Previously cross fade would use a ``ViewAnimation`` for the first image in a request to complete and only use [``TransitionDrawables``][16] for animating from thumbnails to full images. RecyclerView does not handle [``ViewAnimations``][17] run outside of its item animator so we've removed the use of [``ViewAnimation``][17]. As a result, if you use views like ``CircularImageView`` that can't handle animated ``Drawables``, you may see a change in behavior. Consider using a [``ViewAnimation`` based ``Transition``][18] instead of a cross fade if you're not loading in a ``RecyclerView`` or file a new issue if you encounter a situation where neither cross fade nor a [``ViewAnimation``][18] will work.
3. After d83de421024882311c0aa4d835c8fce6a0550f8a, setting [``DecodeFormat.ARGB_8888``][19] or [``DecodeFormat.RGB_565``][20] will cause Glide to attempt to decode Bitmaps using [``Bitmap.Config.HARDWARE``][7]. Hardware Bitmaps are more memory efficient, but can't be drawn in software and don't expose their pixels so methods like [``getPixel()``][21] will throw an exception, as will attempting to draw a hardware bitmap to a [``Canvas``][22]. You can avoid using Hardware Bitmaps for an individual request by calling [``RequestOptions#disallowHardwareConfig``][23]. You can also disallow hardware configurations for your entire application by passing in [``RequestOptions`` into ``GlideBuilder`` in your ``AppGlideModule``][24].

There are too many changes to list individually, but here's a few highlights:

* New [documentation][1] that users can contribute to by submitting pull requests to Glide's gh-pages branch.
* A new [extensible generated API][2] that allows you to easily customize Glide's fluent API by adding new types or custom option sets.
* Substantially simplified types for individual requests that ensure that options are consistently available and easy to use even if you're loading different types of resources.
* A variety of performance improvements, including a substantial reduction in garbage when downsampling images, a more intelligent default disk cache strategy, and improved performance when loading GIFs. 
* Improved handling of View sizes and layouts, especially in RecyclerView.

## Status
Glide 4.0 is used internally by a variety of teams at Google and the library is considered stable internally. I expect that there will be more external users who may uncover issues that haven't come up internally. As a result I'm releasing this as an RC. If we don't uncover significant issues with stability or in the API, I expect a non-RC release shortly.

## Release schedule.
Glide has had a rather haphazard approach to releases in the past, largely because I maintain Glide mostly in my free time. Going forward we're going to try to provide regular releases:

* Releases will go out once a month, around the 15th (the exact date may vary a bit)
* Releases will be skipped only if no changes have been since the previous release.
* Releases may include breaking API changes without a major version change.

The third bullet point will help bridge the gap between how Glide is maintained inside and outside of Google and enable more regular releases.

- Support for an original size (#274):

``` java
// You can override a view's size to request the original image:
Glide.with(context)
    .load(myUrl)
    .override(Target.SIZE_ORIGINAL, Target.SIZE_ORIGINAL)
    .into(myImageVIew);

// SimpleTarget also now defaults to SIZE_ORIGINAL:
Glide.with(context)
    .load(myUrl)
    .into(new SimpleTarget<GlideDrawable>() {
        @Override
        public void onResourceReady(GlideDrawable drawable, GlideAnimation animation) {

Animated GIFs were a significant focus of this release. We've substantially increased the number of GIFs that can be decoded successfully by our GifDecoder and fixed a variety of smaller issues with rendering and in our decoding pipeline in older versions of Android.

You can also see a complete list of issues in the corresponding [milestone](https://github.com/bumptech/glide/issues?q=milestone%3A3.4+is%3Aclosed).

## Features
- Allow RequestBuilders to be re-used for multiple loads by introducing the `.from()` and `.clone()` APIs. These APIs allow users to set options on a request builder once, pass the builder to their adapters, and then start multiple loads with the single builder (#182).

``` java
// In your Activity/Fragment
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    DrawableRequestBuilder requestBuilder = 
        Glide.with(this)
           .from(String.class)
           .placeholder(R.drawable.spinner)
           .centerCrop()
           .crossFade();
    mAdapter = new MyAdapter(requestBuilder);
}

// In your Adapter
@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroupParent parent) {
    ...
   mRequestBuilder.load(myUrls.get(position)).into(convertView);
}
```
- Add a method to GlideBuilder to set a global decode format (#177), see the [configuration wiki](https://github.com/bumptech/glide/wiki/Configuration#bitmap-format-new-in-glide-34). 

``` java
Glide.setup(new GlideBuilder(context)
    .setDecodeFormat(DecodeFormat.ALWAYS_ARGB_8888));
```
- Add a `.preload()` API to allow preloading media into memory (#169).

``` java
Glide.with(fragment)
    .load(url)
    .preload(width, height);
```
- Add a `.signature()` API to allow users to easily mix in additional data to cache keys, giving users more control over cache invalidation (#178, #179), see the [cache invalidation wiki](https://github.com/bumptech/glide/wiki/Caching-and-Cache-Invalidation#signatures-coming-soon-in-glide-34).

``` java
Glide.with(fragment)
    .load(url)
    .signature(new StringSignature(""Version1""))
    .into(view);
```
- Add a `Glide.preFillBitmapPool()` API to allow pre-filling the BitmapPool to avoid jank from allocations after app startup (#93).

``` java
Glide.get(context)
    .preFillBitmapPool(new PreFillType.Builder(mySize));
```
- Allow recursive calls to `thumbnail()` to load an arbitrary number of different sized thumbnails for a single Target (#149).

``` java
Glide.with(fragment)
    .load(myUrl)
    .thumbnail(Glide.with(fragment)
        .load(myUrl)
        .override(200, 200)
        .thumbnail(Glide.with(fragment)
           .load(myUrl)
           .override(50, 50)))
    .into(myView);
```
- Allow `thumbnail()` to load model and data types that are different than those of the parent (#107).
- Transformations are now only applied once and no longer have to be idempotent (#112).

## Build/Infrastructure
- PMD/Findbugs (#164)
- Jacoco/Coveralls with 85% test coverage (34f797ba79d3dbb59765c6a1d03fda6d8751e300).
- Standard import order (f7a6d65cf7c1a41908dd48e0dab68ee5b881387e).

## Bugs

### Performance
- Avoid allocating large byte arrays in `BufferedInputStream` (#225).
- Use downsampled image size when obtaining Bitmaps from the pool (#224).

### GIFs
- Avoid a crash causing race decoding multiple frames with the same GifDecoder (#212).
- Always use `ARGB_8888` to prevent null GIF frames on some versions of Android that don’t support `ARGB_4444` (#216).
- Fix partially decoded GIF frames (appears as grey or transparent noise in frames) (#207, #204).
- Set a default frame delay for GIFs which do not specify a frame delay, or specify an overly short frame delay (#205).
- More robust GIF decoding logic, including a fix for decoding only the first few rows of certain GIFs (#203).
- Allow fade in/cross fade animations by ensuring that the first frame of GIFs is decoded before the GIF is returned (#159).
- Fix GIFs always appearing transparent pre KitKat (#199).

### Memory
- Fix a memory leak when Glide is first called in an Activity (#210).

### Transformations
- Fix underdraw in `FitCenter` causing noise along the sides of certain images (#195).
- Maintain transparency during bitmap transformations (#156).

### Caching
- Fixed Drawables being cached only be integer resource id which can change and/or overlap after subsequent compilations (#172).

### Uris
- Fix failure to detect certain types of file Uris (#161).

### Other
- Fix concurrency bugs resulting in incorrect assertions being thrown when loads were started on multiple threads (#191, #181).
- Fix `BitmapRequestBuilder` not setting the decode format on the cache decoder when `format()` is called (#187).
- Fix an assertion in `ViewTarget` related to restarting requests (#167). 
- Fix `Glide.with()` throwing pre Honeycomb when given non-support Activities (#158).
- Avoid using Closeable interface when loading ParcelFileDescriptors on 4.1.1 or earlier (#157).
- Fix an NPE in `Bitmap#getAllocationByteCount()` due to a framework bug in the initial release of KitKat (#148).
