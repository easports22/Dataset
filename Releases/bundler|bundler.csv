  - Better error when a changed Gemfile conflicts with Gemfile.lock

Bugfixes:

  - Create bin/ directory if it is missing, then install binstubs
  - Error nicely on the edge case of a pinned gem with no spec
  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

  - Allow using the --gemfile flag with the --deployment flag

## 1.0.0.rc.4 (August 9, 2010)

Features:

  - `bundle gem NAME` command to generate a new gem with Gemfile

  - Add --frozen to disable updating the Gemfile.lock at runtime
    (default with --deployment)
  - Basic Capistrano task now added as 'bundler/capistrano'

  - Better error when a changed Gemfile conflicts with Gemfile.lock

Bugfixes:

  - Create bin/ directory if it is missing, then install binstubs
  - Error nicely on the edge case of a pinned gem with no spec
  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

## 1.0.0.rc.6 (August 23, 2010)

Features:

  - Much better documentation for most of the commands and Gemfile
    format

Bugfixes:

  - Don't attempt to create directories if they already exist
  - Fix the capistrano task so that it actually runs
  - Update the Gemfile template to reference rubygems.org instead
    of :gemcutter
  - bundle exec should exit with a non zero exit code when the gem

  - Make the Capistrano task more concise.

Bugfixes:

  - Fix a regression with determining whether or not to use sudo
  - Allow using the --gemfile flag with the --deployment flag

## 1.0.0.rc.4 (August 9, 2010)

Features:

  - `bundle gem NAME` command to generate a new gem with Gemfile
  - Bundle config file location can be specified by BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG
  - Add --frozen to disable updating the Gemfile.lock at runtime
    (default with --deployment)
  - Basic Capistrano task now added as 'bundler/capistrano'

Bugfixes:

  - Multiple bundler process no longer share a tmp directory
  - `bundle update GEM` always updates dependencies of GEM as well
  - Deleting the cache directory no longer causes errors
  - Moving the bundle after installation no longer causes git errors
  - Bundle path is now correctly remembered on a read-only filesystem
  - Gem binaries are installed to Gem.bindir, not #{Gem.dir}/bin
  - Fetch gems from vendor/cache, even without --local
  - Sort lockfile by platform as well as spec

## 1.0.0.rc.3 (August 3, 2010)

Features:

  - Deprecate --production flag for --deployment, since the former
    was causing confusion with the :production group
  - Add --gemfile option to `bundle check`
  - Reduce memory usage of `bundle install` by 2-4x
  - Improve message from `bundle check` under various conditions
  - Better error when a changed Gemfile conflicts with Gemfile.lock

Bugfixes:

  - Create bin/ directory if it is missing, then install binstubs
  - Error nicely on the edge case of a pinned gem with no spec
  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

  - Fix a regression with determining whether or not to use sudo
  - Allow using the --gemfile flag with the --deployment flag

## 1.0.0.rc.4 (August 9, 2010)

Features:

  - Add --frozen to disable updating the Gemfile.lock at runtime
    (default with --deployment)
  - Basic Capistrano task now added as 'bundler/capistrano'

## 1.0.0.rc.3 (August 3, 2010)

  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

  - No .bundle/environment.rb. Require 'bundler/setup' instead.
  - $BUNDLE_HOME defaults to $GEM_HOME instead of ~/.bundle

  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a

  - Fix a regression with determining whether or not to use sudo
  - Allow using the --gemfile flag with the --deployment flag

## 1.0.0.rc.4 (August 9, 2010)

Features:

  - Add --frozen to disable updating the Gemfile.lock at runtime
    (default with --deployment)
  - Basic Capistrano task now added as 'bundler/capistrano'

Bugfixes:

  - Multiple bundler process no longer share a tmp directory
  - `bundle update GEM` always updates dependencies of GEM as well
  - Deleting the cache directory no longer causes errors
  - Moving the bundle after installation no longer causes git errors

  - Gem binaries are installed to Gem.bindir, not #{Gem.dir}/bin
  - Fetch gems from vendor/cache, even without --local
  - Sort lockfile by platform as well as spec

## 1.0.0.rc.3 (August 3, 2010)

  - Deprecate --production flag for --deployment, since the former
    was causing confusion with the :production group
  - Add --gemfile option to `bundle check`
  - Reduce memory usage of `bundle install` by 2-4x
  - Improve message from `bundle check` under various conditions
  - Better error when a changed Gemfile conflicts with Gemfile.lock

Bugfixes:

  - Create bin/ directory if it is missing, then install binstubs
  - Error nicely on the edge case of a pinned gem with no spec
  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

  - Much better documentation for most of the commands and Gemfile
    format

Bugfixes:

  - Don't attempt to create directories if they already exist
  - Fix the capistrano task so that it actually runs
  - Update the Gemfile template to reference rubygems.org instead
    of :gemcutter
  - bundle exec should exit with a non zero exit code when the gem
    binary does not exist or the file is not executable.
  - Expand paths in Gemfile relative to the Gemfile and not the current
    working directory.

## 1.0.0.rc.5 (August 10, 2010)

Features:

  - Make the Capistrano task more concise.

Bugfixes:

  - Fix a regression with determining whether or not to use sudo
  - Allow using the --gemfile flag with the --deployment flag

## 1.0.0.rc.4 (August 9, 2010)

Features:

  - `bundle gem NAME` command to generate a new gem with Gemfile
  - Bundle config file location can be specified by BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG
  - Add --frozen to disable updating the Gemfile.lock at runtime
    (default with --deployment)
  - Basic Capistrano task now added as 'bundler/capistrano'

Bugfixes:

  - Multiple bundler process no longer share a tmp directory
  - `bundle update GEM` always updates dependencies of GEM as well
  - Deleting the cache directory no longer causes errors
  - Moving the bundle after installation no longer causes git errors
  - Bundle path is now correctly remembered on a read-only filesystem
  - Gem binaries are installed to Gem.bindir, not #{Gem.dir}/bin
  - Fetch gems from vendor/cache, even without --local
  - Sort lockfile by platform as well as spec

## 1.0.0.rc.3 (August 3, 2010)

Features:

  - Deprecate --production flag for --deployment, since the former
    was causing confusion with the :production group
  - Add --gemfile option to `bundle check`
  - Reduce memory usage of `bundle install` by 2-4x
  - Improve message from `bundle check` under various conditions
  - Better error when a changed Gemfile conflicts with Gemfile.lock

Bugfixes:

  - Create bin/ directory if it is missing, then install binstubs
  - Error nicely on the edge case of a pinned gem with no spec
  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

  - Add --frozen to disable updating the Gemfile.lock at runtime
    (default with --deployment)
  - Basic Capistrano task now added as 'bundler/capistrano'

  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

  - Make the Capistrano task more concise.

Bugfixes:

  - Fix a regression with determining whether or not to use sudo
  - Allow using the --gemfile flag with the --deployment flag

## 1.0.0.rc.4 (August 9, 2010)

Features:

  - `bundle gem NAME` command to generate a new gem with Gemfile
  - Bundle config file location can be specified by BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG
  - Add --frozen to disable updating the Gemfile.lock at runtime
    (default with --deployment)
  - Basic Capistrano task now added as 'bundler/capistrano'

Bugfixes:

  - Multiple bundler process no longer share a tmp directory
  - `bundle update GEM` always updates dependencies of GEM as well
  - Deleting the cache directory no longer causes errors
  - Moving the bundle after installation no longer causes git errors
  - Bundle path is now correctly remembered on a read-only filesystem
  - Gem binaries are installed to Gem.bindir, not #{Gem.dir}/bin
  - Fetch gems from vendor/cache, even without --local
  - Sort lockfile by platform as well as spec

## 1.0.0.rc.3 (August 3, 2010)

Features:

  - Deprecate --production flag for --deployment, since the former
    was causing confusion with the :production group
  - Add --gemfile option to `bundle check`
  - Reduce memory usage of `bundle install` by 2-4x
  - Improve message from `bundle check` under various conditions
  - Better error when a changed Gemfile conflicts with Gemfile.lock

Bugfixes:

  - Create bin/ directory if it is missing, then install binstubs
  - Error nicely on the edge case of a pinned gem with no spec
  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

    and writing the lockfile in binary mode
  - Fix an issue with shelling out to git in Windows by
    using double quotes around paths
  - Detect new Rubygems sources in the Gemfile and update
    the lockfile

## 1.0.0.rc.6 (August 23, 2010)

Features:

  - Much better documentation for most of the commands and Gemfile
    format

Bugfixes:

  - Don't attempt to create directories if they already exist
  - Fix the capistrano task so that it actually runs
  - Update the Gemfile template to reference rubygems.org instead
    of :gemcutter
  - bundle exec should exit with a non zero exit code when the gem
    binary does not exist or the file is not executable.
  - Expand paths in Gemfile relative to the Gemfile and not the current
    working directory.

## 1.0.0.rc.5 (August 10, 2010)

Features:

  - Make the Capistrano task more concise.

Bugfixes:

  - Fix a regression with determining whether or not to use sudo
  - Allow using the --gemfile flag with the --deployment flag

## 1.0.0.rc.4 (August 9, 2010)

Features:

  - `bundle gem NAME` command to generate a new gem with Gemfile
  - Bundle config file location can be specified by BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG
  - Add --frozen to disable updating the Gemfile.lock at runtime
    (default with --deployment)
  - Basic Capistrano task now added as 'bundler/capistrano'

Bugfixes:

  - Multiple bundler process no longer share a tmp directory
  - `bundle update GEM` always updates dependencies of GEM as well
  - Deleting the cache directory no longer causes errors
  - Moving the bundle after installation no longer causes git errors
  - Bundle path is now correctly remembered on a read-only filesystem
  - Gem binaries are installed to Gem.bindir, not #{Gem.dir}/bin
  - Fetch gems from vendor/cache, even without --local
  - Sort lockfile by platform as well as spec

## 1.0.0.rc.3 (August 3, 2010)

Features:

  - Deprecate --production flag for --deployment, since the former
    was causing confusion with the :production group
  - Add --gemfile option to `bundle check`
  - Reduce memory usage of `bundle install` by 2-4x
  - Improve message from `bundle check` under various conditions
  - Better error when a changed Gemfile conflicts with Gemfile.lock

Bugfixes:

  - Create bin/ directory if it is missing, then install binstubs
  - Error nicely on the edge case of a pinned gem with no spec
  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation.

7538008,2010-10-02T06:24:48Z,2017-08-28T03:13:39Z,v1.0.0,"Features:

  - You can now define `:bundle_cmd` in the capistrano task

Bugfixes:

  - Various bugfixes to the built-in rake helpers
  - Fix a bug where shortrefs weren't unique enough and were
    therfore colliding
  - Fix a small bug involving checking whether a local git
    clone is up to date
  - Correctly handle explicit '=' dependencies with gems
    pinned to a git source
  - Fix an issue with Windows-generated lockfiles by reading
    and writing the lockfile in binary mode
  - Fix an issue with shelling out to git in Windows by
    using double quotes around paths
  - Detect new Rubygems sources in the Gemfile and update
    the lockfile

## 1.0.0.rc.6 (August 23, 2010)

Features:

  - Much better documentation for most of the commands and Gemfile
    format

Bugfixes:

  - Don't attempt to create directories if they already exist
  - Fix the capistrano task so that it actually runs
  - Update the Gemfile template to reference rubygems.org instead
    of :gemcutter
  - bundle exec should exit with a non zero exit code when the gem
    binary does not exist or the file is not executable.
  - Expand paths in Gemfile relative to the Gemfile and not the current
    working directory.

## 1.0.0.rc.5 (August 10, 2010)

Features:

  - Make the Capistrano task more concise.

Bugfixes:

  - Fix a regression with determining whether or not to use sudo
  - Allow using the --gemfile flag with the --deployment flag

## 1.0.0.rc.4 (August 9, 2010)

Features:

  - `bundle gem NAME` command to generate a new gem with Gemfile
  - Bundle config file location can be specified by BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG
  - Add --frozen to disable updating the Gemfile.lock at runtime
    (default with --deployment)
  - Basic Capistrano task now added as 'bundler/capistrano'

Bugfixes:

  - Multiple bundler process no longer share a tmp directory
  - `bundle update GEM` always updates dependencies of GEM as well
  - Deleting the cache directory no longer causes errors
  - Moving the bundle after installation no longer causes git errors
  - Bundle path is now correctly remembered on a read-only filesystem
  - Gem binaries are installed to Gem.bindir, not #{Gem.dir}/bin
  - Fetch gems from vendor/cache, even without --local
  - Sort lockfile by platform as well as spec

## 1.0.0.rc.3 (August 3, 2010)

Features:

  - Deprecate --production flag for --deployment, since the former
    was causing confusion with the :production group
  - Add --gemfile option to `bundle check`
  - Reduce memory usage of `bundle install` by 2-4x
  - Improve message from `bundle check` under various conditions
  - Better error when a changed Gemfile conflicts with Gemfile.lock

Bugfixes:

  - Create bin/ directory if it is missing, then install binstubs
  - Error nicely on the edge case of a pinned gem with no spec
  - Do not require gems for other platforms
  - Update git sources along with the gems they contain

## 1.0.0.rc.2 (July 29, 2010)

  - `bundle install path` was causing confusion, so we now print
    a clarifying warning. The preferred way to install to a path
    (which will not print the warning) is
    `bundle install --path path/to/install`.
  - `bundle install --system` installs to the default system
    location ($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME) even if you previously
    used `bundle install --path`
  - completely remove `--disable-shared-gems`. If you install to
    system, you will not be isolated, while if you install to
    another path, you will be isolated from gems installed to
    the system. This was mostly an internal option whose naming
    and semantics were extremely confusing.
  - Add a `--production` option to `bundle install`:
    - by default, installs to `vendor/bundle`. This can be
      overridden with the `--path` option
    - uses `--local` if `vendor/cache` is found. This will
      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`
      instead
    - Raises an exception if a Gemfile.lock is not found
    - Raises an exception if you modify your Gemfile in development
      but do not check in an updated Gemfile.lock
  - Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to

isolation.
