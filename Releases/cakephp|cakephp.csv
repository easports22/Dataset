This is the first stable release of 3.5.0. 3.5.0 provides a number improvements both large and small to CakePHP. It also deprecates several features that will be removed in 4.0.0.

In following with our [previously announced roadmap](http://bakery.cakephp.org/2017/06/23/upcoming-cakephp-roadmap.html) work will now begin on 3.6. This work will take place in the ``3.next`` branch, while the ``master`` branch now contains ``3.5.x``.

Upgrading to 3.5.0
------------------

You can use composer to upgrade to CakePHP 3.5.0::

    php composer.phar require ""cakephp/cakephp:3.5.0""

Deprecations
------------

3.5.0 deprecates a number of methods as we continue to transition away from combined get/set methods in favour of separate get/set methods. The [migration guide](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-5-migration-guide.html#deprecations) has the full list of deprecated methods and their replacements. Deprecated features will continue to exist and behave as they always have until 4.0.0

What's new in 3.5.0?
--------------------

The [migration guide](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-5-migration-guide.html) has a complete list of what's new in 3.5.0. We recommend you give that page a read when upgrading.

* Scoped Middleware - Middleware can now be conditionally applied to routes in  specific URL scopes. This allows you to build specific stacks of middleware  for different parts of your application without having to write URL checking  code in your middleware.
* New Middleware - New middleware was added to apply CSRF tokens, and encrypted  cookies.
* Improved Console Environment - A new console dispatcher has been added,  integrating the ``Application`` class into the CLI environment. Integration  testing helpers have been added making testing console commands simpler.
* Helpful Console Errors - Missing options & subcommands now make suggestions  of valid options instead of just erroring out.
* Cache Engine Fallbacks - Cache engines can now be configured with a fallback  key that defines a cache configuration to fall back to if the engine is  misconfigured (or unavailable).
* Cookie Objects - New Cookie & CookieCollection classes have been added. These  classes allow you to work with cookies in an object-orientated way.
* dotenv Support added to Application Skeleton - The application skeleton now  features a 'dotenv' integration making it easier to use environment variables  to configure your application.

After that point, 2.x will become un-maintained and receive no further updates.

New Features

This is a stable release for the 3.4 release branch. 3.4.0 provides a number of improvements to CakePHP. It also deprecates several features that will be removed in 4.0.0.

## CakePHP 3.1.0 End of Life

With the release of 3.4.0, CakePHP 3.1.x becomes end of life and will no longer receive security updates. 3.2 will continue to enjoy security fixes until the release of 3.5.0.

## Upgrading to 3.4.0

You can use composer to upgrade to the new version of CakePHP, and receive bug fix release as they are created, run the following:

```
php composer.phar require ""cakephp/cakephp:3.4.*""
```

## Deprecations

3.4.0 deprecates a number of methods as we transition away from combined get/set methods in favour of separate get/set methods. The [migration guide](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-4-migration-guide.html#deprecations) has the full list of deprecated methods and their replacements. Deprecated features will continue to exist and behave as they always have until 4.0.0

## What's new in 3.4.0?

The [migration guide](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-4-migration-guide.html) has a complete list of what's new in 3.4.0. We recommend you give that page a read when upgrading.
- The CakePHP Request & Response objects now implement the complete set of PSR-7  interface methods. This allows you to use one set of methods every where in   your application and leverage libraries that work on PSR-7 compliant objects.
- Routes now support a `_host` option allowing you to match URLs on specific  domains.
- `Collection::chunkWithKeys()` allows you to split a collection into chunks  and preserve the keys for those chunks.
- Email messages can have their priority set.
- `FormHelper` can now read default data out of the query string making GET forms simple to build.

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests. 3.4.0 is a large release and would not have been possible without the community support and feedback.

## Bugfixes and Minor Features

This release fixes a few issues identified in the 3.4.0-beta4, as well as the recent bugfixes from `master` as documented in the [3.3.12 release notes](http://bakery.cakephp.org/2017/01/13/cakephp_3312_released.html). In addition to those changes 3.4.0-RC1 contains:
- `InstanceConfigTrait::config()` has been deprecated. Instead you should used
  `setConfig()` and `getConfig()` methods.
- Routes can now use the `_host` option to restrict which hosts routes will match on.
- `Router::parse()`, `RouteCollection::parse()` and `Route::parse()` have all been deprecated. Instead you should use the `parseRequest()` method which has access to the entire request allowing more flexible routing to be created.
- Subcommands will inherit their description from the parent shell if they don't have a description explicitly set.
- `HtmlHelper` no longer emits `<![CDATA` blocks by default. If you use an XHTML document type, you may need to enable `<![CDATA` again using the `safe` option.
- `Collection::every()` now returns `true` for empty collections. This rectifies a mistake made in 3.2.
- `TranslateBehavior::translateField()` was added.

If there are no major issues reported, we will release 3.4.0 stable next week.

## Notable changes in 3.4.0

`Cake\Network\Response` has been updated to implement the required PSR-7 interfaces and deprecates a number of methods that overlap with the interface methods. It also adds immutable versions of all the helper methods that `Response` has offered in the past. Because the core response object now implements the PSR-7 interface, `Cake\Http\ResponseTransformer` has been deprecated and is no longer used.

`Cake\Http\ServerRequest` has had its remaining public properties deprecated.  All of the public properties on the request should now be accessed via methods:

``` php
$base = $this->request->base;
// Should now be
$base = $this->request->getAttribute('base');
```

In order to offer simpler interfaces that are more predictable, have simpler return types and better facilitate IDE auto-completion, several classes have had their combined get/set methods deprecated. The combined methods have been replaced with `getX`, `setX` style methods. The classes that have been updated in 3.4.0 thus far are:
- Cake\Console\ConsoleOptionParser
- Cake\Database\Connection
- Cake\Database\Driver
- Cake\Database\Expression\FunctionExpression
- Cake\Database\Expression\QueryExpression
- Cake\Database\Expression\ValuesExpression
- Cake\Database\Query
- Cake\Database\Schema\CachedCollection
- Cake\Database\Schema\TableSchema
- Cake\Database\TypeMap
- Cake\ORM\EagerLoadable
- Cake\ORM\Query
- Cake\ORM\Table
- Cake\Validation\Validator
- Cake\View\StringTemplateTrait
- Cake\View\ViewBuilder

In addition each of the association classes now offer a fluent interface for defining the various association options. These methods improve IDE autocompletion and make mistakes easier to find:

``` php
$this->belongsTo('Comments', [
    'foreignKey' => 'article_id',
    'finder' => 'active',
    'startegy' => 'subquery' // Contains a typo that can be hard to spot
]);

// Now becomes
$this->belongsTo('Comments')
    ->setForiegnKey('article_id')
    ->setFinder('active')
    ->setStrategy('subquery');
```

A full list of the changes in 3.4.0 can be found in the [3.4.0 migration guide](http://book.cakephp.org/3.next/en/appendices/3-4-migration-guide.html).

- `AssetFilter` now interacts properly with PSR7 based applications.
- Cookie decryption when using the PSR7 stack now works properly.
- Regressions around marshalling associated data have been fixed.
- All associations now marshall correctly when TranslateBehavior is enabled.
- BelongsToMany `_joinData` records with complex properties now hydrate  correctly again when loaded with find().
- `Request::is()` no longer caches results. This fixes an issue where  parameterized detectors would return cached results when parameters are  different.
- `CakeEmail::deliver()` correctly uses `default` as the default transport  configuration instead of 'fast'.
- `MiddlewareStack::insertAt()` behaves correctly when adding non-Closure  based middleware.
- Dispatcher filters are not doubly invoked when an application uses the PSR7  HTTP stack and dispatcher filters.
- `CrossSchemaTableExpression` and automatic cross database join prefixing  has been removed. This was a new feature in 3.3.0 that caused regressions for  a number of folks. Removing the problematic feature feels like a better  solution over trying to patch issues as they come up.
- Session cookie rotation works correctly, when setting custom cookies, and  using the PSR7 HTTP stack.

## Minor Enhancements
- `Cake\ORM\SaveOptionsBuilder` was added. This class provides a builder  interface for building option sets for save operations. By using a fluent  interface you can reduce the number of errors made.

You can use composer to upgrade to the new version of CakePHP::

```
php composer.phar require ""cakephp/cakephp:~3.3""
```

# Deprecations
- `Router::mapResources()` is deprecated. Use routing scopes and `$routes->resources()` instead.
- `Router::redirect()` is deprecated. Use routing scopes and `$routes->redirect()` instead.
- `Router::parseNamedParams()` is deprecated. Named parameter backwards compatibility will be removed in 4.0.0
- `Cake\Http\Client\Response` has had the following methods deprecated because they overlap with PSR7 interface methods:
  - `statusCode()` use `getStatusCode()` instead.
  - `encoding()` use `getEncoding()` instead.
  - `header()` use `getHeaderLine()` instead.
  - `cookie()` use `getCookie()` instead.
  - `version()` use `getProtocolVersion()` instead.
- Dispatcher Filters are now deprecated. Use the new HTTP middleware features.
- `RequestActionTrait` has been deprecated. Refactor your code to use view cells instead.
- `Cake\Utility\Crypto\Mcrypt` engine has been deprecated as the `mcrypt` extension is deprecated in PHP 7.1. Use the `openssl` driver instead. 

## What's new in 3.3.0?

The [migration guide](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-3-migration-guide.html) has a complete list of what's new in 3.3.0, and what has been deprecated. We recommend you give that page a read when upgrading. A short list of the new features in 3.3.0 is:
- PSR7 Middleware support has been added. This is an opt-in feature that allows you to leverage the increasing number of PSR7 middleware libraries from the broader PHP community in your CakePHP application.
- A new streamlined workflow for TranslateBehavior that makes creating forms for multiple translation values easier than before.
- `Cake\Network\Http\Client` has been moved to `Cake\Http\Client`. Its request and response objects now implement the `PSR7 interfaces <http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/>`__.
- Additional support has been added for mapping complex data types. This makes it easier to work with geo-spatial types, and data that cannot be represented by strings in SQL queries.
- A new `JsonType` was added. This new type lets you use the native JSON types available in MySQL and Postgres. In other database providers the `json` type will map to `TEXT` columns.
- When entities are converted into JSON, the associated objects are no longer converted to an array first using `toArray()`. Instead, the `jsonSerialize()` method will be invoked on all associated entities. This gives you more flexibility and control on which properties are exposed in JSON representations of your entities.
- You can now easily paginate multiple queries in a single controller action/view template.
- To help you better manage cached data from the CLI environment, a shell command has been added that exposes methods for clearing cached data.

3622973,2016-07-10T01:54:04Z,2016-07-10T02:04:45Z,CakePHP 3.3.0-beta released,"The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 3.3.0-beta. This is a beta release for the 3.3 release branch. 3.3 provides a number improvements both large and small. It also deprecates several features that will be removed in 4.0.0. We would appreciate any feedback you might have on the new features before their API definitions become stable. In particular for the new PSR7 related features, as we see PSR7 as playing a big part in CakePHP's future.

## Upgrading to the Beta

You can use composer to upgrade to the beta version of CakePHP 3.3.0:

```
php composer.phar require ""cakephp/cakephp:3.3.0-beta""
```

## Behavior Changes

In minor releases, we release changes that are API compatible, but represent minor variances in behavior that may effect your application:
- The default JSON encode format for Date and DateTime instances is now ISO-8601. This means that the timezone value contains a `:`.  For example `2015-11-06T00:00:00+03:00`
- `Controller::referer()` now consistently omits the application base path when generating application local URLs. Previously string URLs would have the base path prepended to them, while array URLs would not.

## Multiple Pagination Support Added

You can now paginate multiple queries in a single controller action/view template. By using the `scope` option you can use scoped query string parameters in pagination:

```
// In a controller action
$articles = $this->paginate($this->Articles, ['scope' => 'article']);
$tags = $this->paginate($this->Tags, ['scope' => 'tag']);
$this->set(compact('articles', 'tags'));
```

In your views, you can define the model being paginated to use scoped query string parameters:

```
// Create links for the paginated articles.
$this->Paginator->options(['defaultModel' => 'Articles']);

// Create links for the paginated tags.
$this->Paginator->options(['defaultModel' => 'Tags']);
```

## PSR7 Middleware Added

In tandem with the deprecation of Dispatcher Filters, support for PSR7 middleware has been added. Middleware is major piece of the new HTTP stack, and is an opt-in component of CakePHP 3.3.0. By using the new HTTP stack, you can take advantage of features like:
- Using middleware from plugins, and libraries outside of CakePHP.
- Leverage the same response object methods in both the responses you get from `Http\Client` and the responses your application generates.
- Be able to augment the response objects emitted by error handling and asset delivery.

See the [middleware documentation](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/controllers/middleware.html) for more information on how to use the new HTTP stack.

## Http Client is now PSR7 Compatible

`Cake\Network\Http\Client` has been moved to `Cake\Http\Client`. Its request and response objects now implement the [PSR7 interfaces](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).

## ORM Improvements
- Additional support has been added for mapping complex data types. This makes it easier to work with geo-spatial types, and data that cannot be represented by strings in SQL queries.
- A new `JsonType` was added. This new type lets you use the native JSON types available in MySQL and Postgres. In other database providers the `json` type will map to `TEXT` columns.
- `Association::unique()` was added. This method proxies the target table's `unique()` method, but ensures that association conditions are applied.
- `isUnique` rules now apply association conditions.
- When entities are converted into JSON, the associated objects are no longer converted to an array first using `toArray()`. Instead, the `jsonSerialize()` method will be invoked on all associated entities. This gives you more flexibility and control on which properties are exposed in JSON representations of your entities.
- `Table::newEntity()` and `Table::patchEntity()` will now raise an exception when an unknown association is in the 'associated' key.
- `RulesChecker::validCount()` was added. This new method allows to apply rules to the number of associated records an entity has.
- The `partialNullsPass` option was added to the `existsIn` rule. This option allows rules to pass when some columns are null.

# Cache Shell Added

To help you better manage cached data from the CLI environment, a shell command
has been added that exposes methods for clearing cached data:

```
// Clear one cache config
bin/cake cache clear <configname>

// Clear all cache configs
bin/cake cache clear_all
```

## Other Changes

There are many other great new things in 3.3.0. Refer to the [migration guide](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-3-migration-guide.html) for all the greatness 3.3.0 brings.

## Deprecations

3.3.0 will deprecate a number of features. Refer to the [deprecated features](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-3-migration-guide.html#deprecations) for more details. Deprecated features will not be removed until 4.0.0.

Unless there are major issues with the 3.3.0-beta release, we will have a release candidate and stable release packaged in the 4-5 weeks. The documentation for 3.3.0 is now available in the [book](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en).

fixes and bugfixes.

## Security Fixes

These releases fix a weakness in `Validation::uploadedFile()` where file inputs could be manipulated to accept existing files on the server. This could potentially lead to an attacker being able to access sensitive system files. If you are using `Validation::uploadedFile()` and not checking mime-types or ensuring that the file was in-fact an uploaded file, you should upgrade. We'd like to thank Kurita Takashi for reporting this issue.

- Queries generated by the marshaller now correctly alias primary key columns.  (@markstory)
- Complex conditions in BelongsToMany associations now work correctly.  (@markstory)

- `Http\Client` now supports `ssl_verify_peer_name` option correctly now.  (@curtisgibby)
- CakePHP can now be used from within a phar file. (@lorenzo)
- Bound parameters in sub-queries now propagate to their parent query.  (@markstory)

## Security Fixes

These releases fix a weakness in `Validation::uploadedFile()` where file inputs could be manipulated to accept existing files on the server. This could potentially lead to an attacker being able to access sensitive system files. If you are using `Validation::uploadedFile()` and not checking mime-types or ensuring that the file was in-fact an uploaded file, you should upgrade. We'd like to thank Kurita Takashi for reporting this issue.

## Bugfixes in 2.8.3
- Improved API docs. (@ravage84)
- Boolean `false` is now treated as `0` when creating selectboxes. This allows select widgets to be used for boolean columns. (@markstory)
- Optimized nested association loading. (@tharlinsmith)
- `ControllerTestCase::testAction()` now clears the request stack after each call. This fixes issues where multiple calls to testAction() could not be done in the same test method when using array URLs. (@markstory)

## Bugfixes

You can expect the following changes in 3.2.4. See the [changelog](http://cakephp.org/changelogs/3.2.4) for every commit.
- Table names are now quoted in SQLserver schema reflection when reflecting indexes. This allows table names in different schemas to be used. (@markstory)
- `Validation::date()`, `Validation::dateTime()` and `Validation::time()` now accept `DateTimeImmutable`. (@markstory)
- Warning related to PO file parsing when a message exists as both a context inclusive and context free message have been fixed. In this situation, the first message encountered will be used and the other will not be accessible.  (@markstory)
- Serialization errors when reading negative numbers from Redis have been fixed.  (@markstory)
- The ORM will now emit warnings when association properties shadow properties in a table. (@ADmad)
- Default string values now work correctly in Postgres. (@chinpei215)
- RelativeTimeFormatter now correctly formats 'about a month ago'/'in about a month' (@chinpei215)
- XML and JSON responses no longer contain stack traces. Including stack traces could cause fatal errors when unserializable objects were in the stack trace.  (@markstory)
- Routes don't recompile each time they are used within a single request.  (@Phillaf)
- Unlinking HasMany associations correctly prefixes conditions, which fixes issues when an association finder includes additional associations by default.  (@greew)
- Unlinking empty HasMany associations no longer emits warnings on null.  (@lorenzo)
- `UnaryExpression` now correctly calls traverse on child expressions. (@greew)
- Time formatting no longer emits errors when using Russian or other languages that have more than 2 plural forms. (@lorenzo)
- `Response::file()` no longer attempts to clear the output buffering. This allows test cases involving files to not be marked as 'risky' by PHPUnit.  (@lorenzo)

## Minor Enhancements
- Improved API docs (@btaens, @markstory, @antograssiot)
- `Response::getFile()` was added. This gives you a way to read the file out of a response, which is helpful in testing. (@markstory)
- `Association::className()` was added. This lets you read the className option out of an association. (@ifunk)
- `JsonConfig` now pretty prints dumped files (@markstory)
- Routes can now use the `multibytePattern` option to enable multi-byte sub patterns in routes. (@markstory)
- `UrlHelper::css()`, `UrlHelper::script()` and `UrlHelper::image()` were added. (@jadb, @ADmad)
- `MultipleCheckboxWidget` now handles grouped options. This makes it more consistent with Select boxes. (@markstory)
- `IntegrationTestCase::assertFileResponse` was added. This method makes it easier to assert file responses. (@lorenzo)

- DbAcl inherited permissions for '*' now take into account explicit allow/inherit in leaf nodes. (@markstory)
- `HttpSocket` now correctly parses empty headers. (@markstory)
- Negative numbers can now be read from RedisCacheEngine. (@markstory)

## Minor Features
- Postgres now supports a `uuid` type. This uses the native `uuid` type in Postgres. (@skie)
- `SecurityComponent::requireAuth()` is now deprecated. It was already removed from 3.x. This makes the deprecation in 2.x official. (@ravage84)
- `Security::randomBytes()` was added. This method replaces `Text::uuid()` as the seed value for CSRF token generation. The new method emits a warning if an insecure source of random data is used. This warning indicates that your CSRF tokens could be susceptible to timing attacks. (@markstory)

2567329,2016-02-07T01:59:33Z,2016-02-07T02:08:15Z,CakePHP 2.8.0 Released,"The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 2.8.0. This release is the first stable release for the 2.8 branch which adds several new features to the 2.x series.

## Deprecations
- The `action` option in `FormHelper::create()` has been deprecated, as it was in 3.x. Note that this now makes the `action` key of an array URL consistently respected for the generation of the DOM ID.  If you used the deprecated key you will want to compare the generated ID for forms before and after your upgrade.

## PHP7 Compatibility

CakePHP 2.8 is compatible with, and tested against PHP7.

## New Features
- When handling fatal errors, CakePHP will now adjust the memory limit by 4MB to ensure that the error can be logged correctly. You can disable this behavior by setting `Error.extraFatalErrorMemory` to `0` in your `Config/core.php`.
- `Cache::add()` has been added. This method lets you add data to a cache if the key did not already exist. This method will work atomically in Memcached, Memcache, APC and Redis. Other cache backends will do non-atomic operations.
- `CakeTime::listTimezones()` has been changed to accept array in the last argument. Valid values for the `$options` argument are: `group`, `abbr`, `before`, and `after`.
- A new option `no-locations` has been added to `Console/cake i18n`. When enabled, this option will disable the generation of location references in your POT files.
- `Hash::sort()` now supports case-insensitive sorting via the `ignoreCase` option.
- Magic finders now support custom finder types. For example if your model implements a `find('published')` finder, you can now use `findPublishedBy` and `findPublishedByAuthorId` functions through the magic method interface.
- The `Session.cacheLimiter` configuration option was added. This option lets you define the cache control headers used for the session cookie. The default is `must-revalidate`.

# 3.x Backports
- Shell Helpers have been backported from 3.x.
- `Validation::uploadedFile()` was backported from 3.x.
- `'url' => false` is now supported for `FormHelper::create()` to allow form tags to be created without HTML `action` attribute.

The documentation for 2.8.0 is already available in the [book](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en) and the [API](http://api.cakephp.org/2.8).

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests. Development will now begin on 2.9.0 with the target of releasing sometime in July of 2016.

2520635,2016-01-30T03:34:51Z,2016-01-30T03:42:41Z,CakePHP 3.2.0 released,"The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 3.2.0. This is the first stable release for the 3.2 branch. Going forward 3.1 will only receive security updates. 3.2 is a backwards compatible release with 3.1 and 3.0 and provides new features and performance improvements.

## Minimum PHP 5.5 Required

CakePHP 3.2 requires at least PHP 5.5.9. By adopting PHP 5.5 we can provide better Date and Time libraries and remove dependencies on password compatibility libraries.

## Deprecations

As we continue to improve CakePHP, certain features are deprecated as they are replaced with better solutions. Deprecated features will not be removed until 4.0:
- `Shell::error()` is deprecated because its name does not clearly indicate that it both outputs a message and stops execution. Use `Shell::abort()` instead.
- `Cake\Database\Expression\QueryExpression::type()` is deprecated. Use `tieWith()` instead.
- `Cake\Database\Type\DateTimeType::$dateTimeClass` is deprecated.  Use DateTimeType::useMutable() or DateTimeType::useImmutable() instead.
- `Cake\Database\Type\\DateType::$dateTimeClass` is deprecated.  Use
  `DateTimeType::useMutable()` or `DateType::useImmutable()` instead.
- `Cake\ORM\ResultSet::_calculateTypeMap()` is now unused and deprecated.
- `Cake\ORM\ResultSet::_castValues()` is now unused and deprecated.

## Disabling Deprecation Warnings

Upon upgrading you may encounter several deprecation warnings. These warnings are emitted by methods, options and functionality that will be removed in CakePHP 4.x, but will continue to exist throughout the lifetime of 3.x. While we recommend addressing deprecation issues as they are encountered, that is not always possible. If you'd like to defer fixing deprecation notices, you can disable them in your **config/app.php**:

``` php
    'Error' => [
        'errorLevel' => E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED,
    ]
```

The above error level will suppress deprecation warnings from CakePHP.

## Carbon Replaced with Chronos

The Carbon library has been replaced with [cakephp/chronos](https://github.com/cakephp/chronos). This new library is a fork of Carbon with no additional dependencies. It also offer a calendar date object, and immutable versions of both date and datetime objects.

## New Date Object

The `Date` class allows you to cleanly map `DATE` columns into PHP objects.  Date instances will always fix their time to `00:00:00 UTC`. By default the ORM creates instances of `Date` when mapping `DATE` columns now.

## New Immutable Date and Time Objects

The `FrozenTime`, and `FrozenDate` classes were added. These classes offer the same API as the `Time` object has. The frozen classes provide immutable variants of `Time` and `Date`.  By using immutable objects, you can prevent accidental mutations. Instead of in-place modifications, modifier methods return _new_ instances:

``` php
use Cake\I18n\FrozenTime;

$time = new FrozenTime('2016-01-01 12:23:32');
$newTime = $time->modify('+1 day');
```

In the above code `$time` and `$newTime` are different objects. The `$time` object retains its original value, while `$newTime` has the modified value. As of 3.2, the ORM can map date/datetime columns into immutable objects as well.

## CorsBuilder Added

In order to make setting headers related to Cross Origin Requests (CORS) easier, a new `CorsBuilder` has been added. This class lets you define CORS related headers with a fluent interface.

## RedirectRoute raises an exception on redirect

`Router::redirect()` now raises `Cake\Network\Routing\RedirectException` when a redirect condition is reached. This exception is caught by the routing filter and converted into a response. This replaces calls to `response->send()` and allows dispatcher filters to interact with redirect responses.

## ORM Improvements
- Containing the same association multiple times now works as expected, and the query builder functions are now stacked.
- Function expressions now correctly cast their results. This means that expressions like `$query->func()->current_date()` will return datetime instances.
- Field data that fails validation can now be accessed in entities via the `invalid()` method.
- Entity accessor method lookups are now cached and perform better.

## Improved Validator API

The Validator object has a number of new methods that make building validators less verbose. For example adding validation rules to a username field can now look like:

``` php
$validator->email('username')
    ->ascii('username')
    ->lengthBetween('username', [4, 8]);
```

## Console Improvements
- `Shell::info()`, `Shell::warn()` and `Shell::success()` were added.  These helper methods make using commonly used styling simpler.
- `Cake\Console\Exception\StopException` was added.
- `Shell::abort()` was added to replace `error()`.

## StopException Added

`Shell::_stop()` and `Shell::error()` no longer call `exit()`. Instead they raise `Cake\Console\Exception\StopException`. If your shells/tasks are catching `\Exception` where these methods would have been called, those catch blocks will need to be updated so they don't catch the `StopException`. By not calling `exit()` testing shells should be easier and require fewer mocks.  

## Helpers initialize()

Helpers can now implement an `initialize(array $config)` hook method like other class types.

## FormHelper

The `action` key for `FormHelper::create()` has been deprecated. You should use the `url` key directly.

## Fatal Error Memory Limit Handling

A new configuration option `Error.extraFatalErrorMemory` can be set to the number of megabytes to increase the memory limit by when a fatal error is encountered. This allows breathing room to complete logging or error handling.

Development on 3.3 will now start. The [Roadmap](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/wiki/3.3-Roadmap) for 3.3 is still incomplete, so if there is a feature or improvement you'd like to see reach out on IRC and github.  The documentation for 3.2.0 is currently available in the [book](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en) and the [API](http://api.cakephp.org/3.2).

This release is the first release candidate for the 3.2 branch which adds several new features to the 3.x series. We would appreciate any feedback you might have on the new features before their API definitions become stable.

## Minimum PHP 5.5 Required

CakePHP 3.2 requires at least PHP 5.5.10. By adopting PHP 5.5 we can provide better Date and Time libraries and remove dependencies on password compatibility libraries.

## Disabling Deprecation Warnings

Upon upgrading you may encounter several deprecation warnings. These warnings are emitted by methods, options and functionality that will be removed in CakePHP 4.x, but will continue to exist throughout the lifetime of 3.x. While we recommend addressing deprecation issues as they are encountered, that is not always possible. If you'd like to defer fixing deprecation notices, you can disable them in your **config/app.php**::

```
'Error' => [
    'errorLevel' => E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED,
]
```

The above error level will suppress deprecation warnings from CakePHP.

## Carbon Replaced with Chronos

The Carbon library has been replaced with [cakephp/chronos](https://github.com/cakephp/chronos). This new library is a fork of Carbon with no additional dependencies. It also offer a calendar date object, and immutable versions of both date and datetime objects.

## New Date Object

The `Date` class allows you to cleanly map `DATE` columns into PHP objects. Date instances will always fix their time to `00:00:00 UTC`. By default the ORM creates instances of `Date` when mapping `DATE` columns now.

## New Immutable Date and Time Objects

The `FrozenTime`, and `FrozenDate` classes were added. These classes offer the same API as the `Time` object has. The frozen classes provide immutable variants of `Time` and `Date`.  By using immutable objects, you can prevent accidental mutations. Instead of in-place modifications, modifier methods return _new_ instances::

```
use Cake\I18n\FrozenTime;

$time = new FrozenTime('2016-01-01 12:23:32');
$newTime = $time->modify('+1 day');
```

In the above code `$time` and `$newTime` are different objects. The `$time` object retains its original value, while `$newTime` has the modified value. As of 3.2, the ORM can map date/datetime columns into immutable objects as well.

## CorsBuilder Added

In order to make setting headers related to Cross Origin Requests (CORS) easier, a new `CorsBuilder` has been added. This class lets you define CORS related headers with a fluent interface.

## ORM Improvements
- Containing the same association multiple times now works as expected, and the   query builder functions are now stacked. 
- Function expressions now correctly cast their results. This means that   expressions like `$query->func()->current_date()` will return datetime   instances.

## Improved Validator API

The Validator object has a number of new methods that make building validators less verbose. For example adding validation rules to a username field can now look like::

```
$validator->email('username')
    ->ascii('username')
    ->lengthBetween('username', [4, 8]);
```

## Console Improvements
- `Shell::info()`, `Shell::warn()` and `Shell::success()` were added.   These helper methods make using commonly used styling simpler.
- `Cake\Console\Exception\StopException` was added.
- `Shell::abort()` was added to replace `error()`.

## StopException Added

`Shell::_stop()` and `Shell::error()` no longer call `exit()`. Instead they raise `Cake\Console\Exception\StopException`. If your shells/tasks are catching `\Exception` where these methods would have been called, those catch blocks will need to be updated so they don't catch the `StopException`. By not calling `exit()` testing shells should be easier and require fewer mocks.

## Helpers initialize()

Helpers can now implement an `initialize(array $config)` hook method like other class types.

## FormHelper

The `action` key for `FormHelper::create()` has been deprecated. You should use the `url` key directly.

# Fatal Error Memory Limit Handling

A new configuration option `Error.extraFatalErrorMemory` can be set to the number of megabytes to increase the memory limit by when a fatal error is encountered. This allows breathing room to complete logging or error handling.

## Deprecations

As we continue to improve CakePHP, certain features are deprecated as they are replaced with better solutions. Deprecated features will not be removed until 4.0:
- `Shell::error()` is deprecated because its name does not clearly indicate   that it both outputs a message and stops execution. Use `Shell::abort()`   instead.
- `Cake\Database\Expression\QueryExpression::type()` is deprecated. Use `tieWith()` instead.
- `Cake\Database\Type\DateTimeType::$dateTimeClass` is deprecated.  Use   DateTimeType::useMutable() or DateTimeType::useImmutable() instead.
- `Cake\Database\Type\DateType::$dateTimeClass` is deprecated.  Use   `DateTimeType::useMutable()` or `DateType::useImmutable()` instead.
- `Cake\ORM\ResultSet::_calculateTypeMap()` is now unused and deprecated.
- `Cake\ORM\ResultSet::_castValues()` is now unused and deprecated.

Unless there are major issues with the 3.2.0-RC1 release, we will have a stable release packaged in the next 4-5 weeks. The documentation for 3.2.0 is now available in the [book](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en) and the [API](http://api.cakephp.org/3.2).

## Bugfixes

You can expect the following changes in 3.1.5. See the [changelog](http://cakephp.org/changelogs/3.1.5) for every commit.
- `Collection::toArray()` now drops the keys when dealing with RecursiveIterator. This makes the collection features easier to reason about as they generally do what people have been expecting.
- Improved API documentation.
- `ResultSet::isEmpty()` no longer consumes records on buffered iterators that had not already been iterated.
- The ORM no longer emits invalid queries when eager loading associations using the subquery strategy, and using an ORDER BY clause. Fields used in ORDER BY clauses are also included in the selected fields.
- Error handling is now compatible with PHP7. This removes the last known compatibility error with PHP7.
- BelongsToMany associations use `bindingKey` correctly now.
- Integer marshalling correctly accepts negative values now.
- When executing Shell 'main' method the current command name is set to 'main'.
- spellcheck is now a standard attribute. Unlike most HTML5 attributes, spellcheck requires 'true' and 'false' values, which means it cannot be a minimized attribute.
- CSRF validation is applied to all HTTP methods that are not 'GET', 'OPTIONS' or 'HEAD'. This prevents invalid HTTP methods from bypassing CSRF validation.
- `RouterBuilder::resources()` correctly inflects the object id when using `'inflect' => 'dasherize'` and nested resources.
- `TimeHelper::format()` no longer shifts string datetimes to the supplied timezone before formatting.
- `Shell::createFile()` no longer converts `\n` to `\r\n` silently when running on windows.

## Minor Enhancements
- `RouteBuilder::addExtension()` was added. This method lets you incrementally add extensions instead of replacing the connected extensions.
- The options passed to `Table::save()`, and `HasMany`/`BelongsToMany` link/unlink/replace methods are being passed through to the internal `Table::save/delete()` calls.
- The `CsrfComponent` now supports an `httpOnly` option. Enabling this option makes the CSRF cookie inaccessible to client side scripting.

- Contained associations now add column typ data into queries. This means that you can use complex datatypes like `DateTime` objects in conditions for association columns.
- XHR requests with query strings that are converted into requestAction calls by `RequestHandlerComponent` now work as expected.
- `Hash::extract()` compatibility with ArrayAccess objects was improved.
- Case expressions in queries no longer mishandle '0'.
- `debug()` no longer elides 'schema' and 'prefix'.

- Rendering issues in the ProgressHelper have been fixed.
- `clone` on Query objects now creates a deep clone as one would expect.
- Corrected API documentation.

## Enhancements
- HasMany associations now support a 'replace' save mode. In this mode, existing associations not in the entity's current property will be removed. New records will also be inserted.
- IntegrationTestCase now provides `enableCsrfToken()` and `enableSecurityToken()` methods to make testing with CsrfComponent and SecurityComponent much simpler.
- The CSRF token post field is now removed from request data after being validated. This makes 'Post Redirect Get' workflows simpler as the CSRF token doesn't need to be manually removed.
- Network\Socket now supports all standard SSL context options via prefixing. e.g `ssl_verify_peer`. These options can also be configured in the SmtpTransport.
- Test Fixture constraint management has been greatly improved. You no longer need to carefully order fixtures to ensure constraints are applied correctly. Instead constraints are created after all tables and records have been created.
- When preparing datatypes for SQL statements, exceptions will now be raised on invalid values instead of silent failures.

# New in 3.1

## ORM Enhancements

A big part of 3.1 was making the ORM even more awesome than it already is.

Lazy Eager Loading

```

You can now Lazily Eager Load Associations. This feature allows you to conditionally load additional associations into a result set, entity or collection of entities:

    $articles = $this->Articles->find('popular')->all();

    // Later on after some logic has run.
    // We can load additional associations.
    $withAuthors = $this->Articles->loadInto($articles, ['Authors']);

Additional Filtering Methods
```

You may have already used `matching()` on the query object. In 3.1 you can
also use `notMatching()` to create a negated matching query:

```
// Find articles with no comments.
$query = $this->Articles->find('popular')
    ->notMatching('Comments');
```

You can use the `leftJoinWith()` and `innerJoinWith()` methods to join
associations without loading columns from those associations. This makes it easy
to do filtering on associations:

```
$query = $this->Articles->find()
    ->innerJoinWith('Authors')
    ->where(['Authors.promoted' => true]);
```

## Mailers

Mailers allow you to create reusable emails throughout your application. They can also be used to contain multiple email configurations in one location. This helps keep your code DRYer and keeps email configuration noise out of other areas in your application. See the [Mailer Documentation for more information](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/email.html#creating-reusable-emails).

## Additional Template Variables in Templates

You can now add additional template placeholders in your application templates, and then populate those placeholders when generating inputs:

```
// Add a template with the help placeholder.
$this->Form->templates([
    'inputContainer' => '<div class=""input {{type}}{{required}}"">
        {{content}} <span class=""help"">{{help}}</span></div>'
]);

// Generate an input and populate the help variable
echo $this->Form->input('password', [
    'templateVars' => ['help' => 'At least 8 characters long.']
]);
```

## Shell Helpers

Shell Helpers let you easily package up complex output generation code. Shell Helpers can be accessed and used from any shell or task:

```
// Output some data as a table.
$this->helper('table')->output($data);

// Get a helper from a plugin.
$this->helper('Plugin.HelperName')->output($data);
```

You can also get instances of helpers and call any public methods on them:

```
// Get and use the Progress Helper.
$progress = $this->helper('Progress');
$progress->increment(10);
$progress->draw();
```

CakePHP provides a Progress and Table helper that you can use to make your CLI tools look better.

## Refreshed Default Application Styles

The styling used in the application skeleton have been streamlined and offer improved rendering on smaller devices. In addition to cleaner visuals, bake templates have been updated to create cleaner markup as well.

![3-1-bake-screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24086/9978967/c4d6e640-5f1f-11e5-9f86-df3e5cd41675.png)

The above screenshot gives you a taste of what the new default styles look like.

## Important Changes From 3.0

While none of the following changes modify method signatures, the behaviour of specific methods is slightly different than in the past:
- `FlashComponent` now stacks Flash messages created with the `set()` or `__call()` methods. This means that the structure in the Session for stored Flash messages has changed.
- New configuration option `storage` has been added. It contains the storage class name that `AuthComponent` uses to store user record. By default `SessionStorage` is used.  If using a stateless authenticator you should configure `AuthComponent` to use `MemoryStorage` instead.
- You can now also configure `AuthComponent` to do the auth check before controller's `beforeFilter()` callback is run using the `checkAuthIn` configuration. This is particularly useful when using stateless authenticators.
- `RequestHandlerComponent` now switches the layout and template based on the parsed extension or `Accept-Type` header in the `beforeRender()` callback instead of `startup()` callback.
- The default mime-type used when sending requests has changed in Http\Client. Previously `multipart/form-data` would always be used. In 3.1, `multipart/form-data` is only used when file uploads are present. When there are no file uploads, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is used.

## Other Enhancements
- The default route class has been changed to `DashedRoute` in the `cakephp/app` repository. Your current code base is not affected by this, but it is recommended to use this route class from now on.
- The `breakpoint()` helper function has been added. This function provides a snippet of code that can be put into `eval()` to trigger an interactive console.
- `Shell::dispatchShell()` no longer outputs the welcome message from the dispatched shell.
- You can now set `_serialized` to `true` for `JsonView` and `XmlView` to serialize all view variables instead of explicitly specifying them.
- `Time::fromNow()` has been added. This method makes it easier to calculate differences from 'now'.
- `Time::i18nFormat()` now supports non-gregorian calendars when formatting dates.
- `Validation::latitude()`, and `Validation::longitude()` were added.
- `Validation::ascii()`, `Validation::utf8()`, and
  `Validation::isInteger()` were added.
- `Cache::add()` was ported from 2.x. This method allows you to atomically add data to a cache backend if the key did not already exist.
- `Time::listTimezones()` now supports options to display timezone abbreviations.
- `Hash::get()` now supports objects implementing ArrayAccess.
- `Hash::sort()` supports case-insensitive sorting through a new `ignoreCase` option.

## Deprecations

As we continue to improve CakePHP, certain features are deprecated as they are
replaced with better solutions. Deprecated features will not be removed until 4.0:
- The `SessionHelper` has been deprecated. You can use `$this->request->session()` directly.
- The following Controller properties are now deprecated:
  - layout
  - view
  - theme
  - autoLayout
  - viewPath
  - layoutPath
  
  Instead of setting these properties on your controllers, you should set them using the ViewBuilder.

The [3.1 migration guide](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-1-migration-guide.html) has a full list of all the changes in 3.1.0 and is recommended reading for those considering upgrading.

## Upgrading your Application

You can use `composer` to upgrade from 3.0 to 3.1::

```
php composer.phar require 'cakephp/cakephp:3.1.*'
php composer.phar require 'cakephp/debug_kit:3.2.*'
php composer.phar require 'cakephp/bake:1.1.*'
```

This will install the new core libraries, update bake and DebugKit. You should then address any deprecation warnings in your application, as deprecated features will be removed in the future. If you are using the default CSS provided with the application skeleton, you should also pull in the most recent CSS in cakephp/app as the default styling and bake templates have been refreshed.

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests.

This release is the first release candidate for the 3.1 branch which adds several new features to the 3.x series. We would appreciate any feedback you might have on the new features before their API definitions become stable.

## Changes Since 3.1.0-beta

There have been several changes to 3.1 through feedback on the beta releases. The following aspects have changed since the beta releases:
- `Controller::getView()` has been removed. In its place `viewBuilder()` has been added. This method and new builder class resolves the issues that were caused by creating view instances eagerly.
- Mailer instances now set their template names based on the action that was invoked.
- `View::viewPath()` is now `View::templatePath()`.
- `Auth.redirect` is no longer to referrer URL when accessing login action. Instead it is only set to a protected URL when trying to access it without authentication, before redirecting to login action.

## Additional Features
- `Validation::latitude()`, and `Validation::longitude()` were added.
- `Validation::ascii()`, `Validation::utf8()`, and `Validation::isInteger()` were added.
- `Cache::add()` was ported from 2.x. This method allows you to atomically add data to a cache backend if the key did not already exist.
- `Time::listTimezones()` now supports options to display timezone abbreviations.
- `Hash::get()` now supports objects implementing ArrayAccess.
- `Hash::sort()` supports case-insensitive sorting through a new `ignoreCase` option.

Unless there are major issues with the 3.1.0-RC release, we will have a stable release packaged in the 2-3 weeks.

We recommend that all users of CakePHP upgrade to one of these releases as soon as possible. CakePHP 3.x is unaffected by the prefix routing issue.

## Other Issues Fixed in 2.7.2
- Uses of self were replaced with static to improve ability to subclass core  classes.
- `HttpSocket` now allows `SNI_enabled` to be disabled.
- `HttpSocket` will continue to read data if it encounters a standalone '0'.
- `ObjectCollection``classes now consistently handle plugin prefixes in`attached()`,`unload()`, and`disable()`.
- Configure now bootstraps after the multibyte shims have been loaded. This solves dependency issue in environments without mbstring.
- Translation context is now correctly parsed out of mo files.
- EmailComponent no longer fatally errors when sending messages with a null  subject.

## Security Fixes

There are two issues that can impact the security of a CakePHP application:
- `Cake\ORM\Query::where()` would allow static methods to be invoked. This   could create unintentional side effects, or undesired query manipulation.
- `Validation::compare()` and `Validation::range()` would allow specifically  crafted data past certain criteria.

## Bugfixes

In addition to the security issues the following issues have been fixed on both branches:
- `Hash::insert()` and `Hash::remove()` now support attribute matchers at all depths.
- `Table::get()` supports a `finder` option that allows custom finders to be  combined with get().
- Terminal colours are enabled for Windows users using the ConEmu terminal  application.
- `Query::matching()` operations with no conditions no longer cause errors.
- `requestAction()` with array parameters includes all default routing  parameters.
- `View::prepend()` now supports a capturing mode like `start()`.
- Typos in alias names used in `contain()` now trigger exceptions instead of  generating incorrect result sets.
- `Http\Client` better supports complex multipart requests.
- `PaginatorHelper::numbers()` supports a modulus of 0 now.
- DateTime instances can be sorted by Collection now.

This release is the first release for the 3.1 branch whichadds several new features to the 3.x series. We would appreciate any feedback you might have on the new features before their API definitions become stable.

## ORM Enhancements

A big part of 3.1 was making the ORM even more awesome than it already is.

#### Lazy Eager Loading

You can now Lazily Eager Load Associations. This feature allows you to conditionally load additional associations into a result set, entity or collection of entities:

``` php
$articles = $this->Articles->find('popular')->all();

// Later on after some logic has run.
// We can load additional associations.
$withAuthors = $this->Articles->loadInto($articles, ['Authors']);
```

#### Additional Filtering Methods

You may have already used `matching()` on the query object. In 3.1 you can also use `notMatching()` to create a negated matching query:

``` php
// Find articles with no comments.
$query = $this->Articles->find('popular')
    ->notMatching('Comments');
```

You can use the `leftJoinWith()` and `innerJoinWith()` methods to join associations without loading columns from those associations. This makes it easy to do filtering on associations:

``` php
$query = $this->Articles->find()
    ->innerJoinWith('Authors')
    ->where(['Authors.promoted' => true]);
```

## Mailers

Mailers allow you to create reusable emails throughout your application. They can also be used to contain multiple email configurations in one location. This helps keep your code DRYer and keeps email configuration noise out of other areas in your application. See the [Mailer Documentation for more information](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/email.html#creating-reusable-emails).

## Additional Template Variables in Templates

You can now add additional template placeholders in your application templates, and then populate those placeholders when generating inputs:

``` php
// Add a template with the help placeholder.
$this->Form->templates([
    'inputContainer' => '<div class=""input {{type}}{{required}}"">
        {{content}} <span class=""help"">{{help}}</span></div>'
]);

// Generate an input and populate the help variable
echo $this->Form->input('password', [
    'templateVars' => ['help' => 'At least 8 characters long.']
]);
```

## Shell Helpers

Shell Helpers let you easily package up complex output generation code. Shell Helpers can be accessed and used from any shell or task:

``` php
// Output some data as a table.
$this->helper('table')->output($data);

// Get a helper from a plugin.
$this->helper('Plugin.HelperName')->output($data);
```

You can also get instances of helpers and call any public methods on them:

``` php
// Get and use the Progress Helper.
$progress = $this->helper('Progress');
$progress->increment(10);
$progress->draw();
```

CakePHP provides a Progress and Table helper that you can use to make your CLI tools look better.

## Important Changes From 3.0

While non of the following changes modified method signatures, the behaviour of specific methods is slightly different than in the past:
- `FlashComponent` now stacks Flash messages when set with the `set()` or `__call()` method. This means that the structure in the Session for stored Flash messages has changed.
- New config `storage` has been added. It contains the storage class name that `AuthComponent` uses to store user record. By default `SessionStorage` is used.  If using a stateless authenticator you should configure `AuthComponent` to use `MemoryStorage` instead.
- `RequestHandlerComponent` now switches the layout and template based on the parsed extension or `Accept-Type` header in the `beforeRender()`
  callback instead of `startup()`.
- The default mime type used when sending requests has changed in Http\Client. Previously `multipart/form-data` would always be used. In 3.1, `multipart/form-data` is only used when file uploads are present. When there are no file uploads, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is used instead.
- The following Controller properties are now deprecated:
  - layout
  - view
  - theme
  - autoLayout
  - viewPath
  - layoutPath
  
  Instead of setting these properties on your controllers, you should set them
  on the view using methods with the same names.

## Other Enhancements
- The default route class has been changed to `DashedRoute` in the `cakephp/app` repo. Your current code base is not affected by this, but it is recommended to use this route class from now on.
- The `breakpoint()` helper function has been added. This function provides a snippet of code that can be put into `eval()` to trigger an interactive
  console.
- `Shell::dispatchShell()` no longer outputs the welcome message from the dispatched shell.
- You can now set `_serialized` to `true` for `JsonView` and `XmlView` to serialize all view variables instead of explicitly specifying them.
- `Time::fromNow()` has been added. This method makes it easier to calculate differences from 'now'.
- `Time::i18nFormat()` now supports non-gregorian calendars when formatting dates.

## Deprecations

As we continue to improve CakePHP, certain features are deprecated as they are replaced with better solutions. Deprecated features will not be removed until 4.0:
- The `SessionHelper` has been deprecated. You can use `$this->request->session()` directly.

Unless there are major issues with the 3.1.0-beta release, we will have a release candidate and stable release packaged in the 4-5 weeks. The documentation for 3.1.0 is now available in the [book](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en) and the [API](http://api.cakephp.org/3.1).

## Bugfixes

You can expect the following changes in 3.0.9. See the [changelog](http://cakephp.org/changelogs/3.0.9) for every commit.
- Index and constraint reflection in MySQL now scopes to the current database.
- `.` is now allowed in ObjectRegistry keys. This allows cache configurations to have `.` in their names.
- Datetime validation now correctly handles meridian values.
- Improved API documentation.
- Pagination link generation is correct with custom routes.
- `Entity::extractOriginalChanged()` now returns properties that were initially null.
- Marshalling `_joinData` in belongsToMany associations with existing entities is now handled correctly.
- `Text::tokenize()` now works as expected when the separator is a multi-byte character.
- Folders generated by `i18n extract` have the correct permissions assigned.
- Entities are now marked as 'clean' after the afterSave event.
- The ORM does not emit UPDATE statements for hasMany and belongsToMany associations that have not actually changed.
- `Response::file()` now accepts files with `..` in the basename.

## Improvements

As part of the 3.0 patch releases we are experimenting with implementing smaller net new features. In 3.0.9 the following new features were added:
- Associations can now define a `bindingKey()` this column allows you to bind associations to non-primary key columns. This aims to remove the need to  define `foreignKey => false` in associations.
- Collections can now be serialized and unserialized with ease. This makes  caching collections easier.
- Exception attributes are no longer logged when debug=0.
- `Response::body()` accepts a callable that can echo content directly or  return the response body.
- `Email::configuredTransport()` was added to allow enumeration of the configured email transports.
- String templates accept `.` and `_` in variable names. This improves compatibility with arrays generated by `Hash::flatten()`
- Custom Type classes can define a baseType that maps to a simpler type. This makes it easier for FormHelper to generate inputs for custom types.
- `i18n extract` now supports a `--no-location` option. This option will omit the location comments for messages from the generated POT file.

The last 2.6 release will be 2.6.9, which will be released later this week.

2.7.0 should be a drop in replacement for your existing 2.5 or 2.6 libraries. In 2.7 the following new features are available.

## Deprecations
- The class `String` has been renamed to `CakeText`. This resolves some  conflicts around HHVM compatibility as well as PHP7. The  `String` class is still provided for compatibility reasons.
- `Validation::notEmpty()` has been renamed to `Validation::notBlank()`.  This aims to avoid confusion around the PHP `notEmpty()` function and that  the validation rule accepts `0` as valid input.
- `SessionComponent::setFlash()` has been deprecated. You should use  `FlashComponent` instead.
- `SessionHelper::flash()` has been deprecated. You should use  `FlashHelper` instead.

## Backported Features From 3.0
- Plugin shells that share a name with their plugin can now be called without  the plugin prefix. For example `Console/cake MyPlugin.my_plugin` can now  be called with `Console/cake my_plugin`.
- `Configure::consume()` has been added to read and delete from  Configure in a single step.
- `CakeSession::consume()` has been added to read and delete from  session in a single step.
- New setting `level` is now available in `TreeBehavior`. You can use it to  specify field name in which the depth of tree nodes will be stored.
- New method `TreeBehavior::getLevel()` has been added which fetches depth of  a node.
- `SessionComponent::consume()` has been added to read and delete  from session in a single step.
- `SessionHelper::consume()` has been added to read and delete from  session in a single step.
- `Shell::param()` has been added. This method allows you to read CLI options  without notice errors.
- The `text/plain` content type is no longer mapped to the 'csv' response type  by RequestHandlerComponent. This helps fix issues when applications used  jQuery and csv responses.

## Other Improvements
- SQL datasources will now cast `''` and `null` into `''` when columns are  not nullable and rows are being created or updated.
- Argument `$renew` has been added to `CakeSession::clear()` to allow  emptying the session without forcing a new id and renewing the session. It  defaults to `true`.
- CakeEmail will now use the 'default' config set when creating instances that  do not specify a configuration set to use. For example `$email = new  CakeEmail();` will now use the 'default' config set.
- `ControllerTestCase::testAction()` now supports an array as URL.

- Fix issue with overlapping irregular inflections. When irregular inflections  overlap we should choose the longest match, not the shortest.
- Fix regression in Inflector::camelize(). The input should not be lowercased  before camelizing, as this can cause inputs that were previously camelized to  create incorrect results.
- Fix Validation::multiple() regarding 0 value. Previously 0 could not be  a valid option.
- FormHelper::radio() now supports complex option definition. This makes it  easier to define custom attributes on each radio button.
- Element tags had trailing whitespace removed. If you have custom element tags  with HtmlHelper you might need to update your templates.
- Shells will now never print HTML errors. Previously if you used custom the  console error handlers you could end up with HTML in your terminal.
- SQL operators in Postgres are now less greedy when fields are quoted.

- Pagination now preserves query string arguments with `0` as their value.
- `Validation::multiple()` now correctly handles '0'.
- Previously it was impossible to use dot notation on two different calls to matching/contain when part of the string was shared (for example Articles.SpecialTags.Tags and Articles.SpecialTags.Authors).
- `TableRegistry::get()` now correctly merges pre-configured options.
- Table names in `UPDATE` queries are correctly quoted now.
- Fixtures now correctly reflect composite primary keys when generated.
- Both `[]` and `''` are now treated the same when saving belongsToMany associations. This fixes silent failures when '' was used.
- Numeric fields are cast to their string values when creating form security tokens. This resolves issues where integer values would cause validation failures.
- CsrfComponent now correctly sets the cookie expiry date.
- The list of available shell commands is now correct if there is an app Shell with the same name as a core one.
- Multicheckboxes generated with complex input types are now checked/disabled correctly.
- When updating belongsToMany links, association conditions are used. This fixes issues with polymorphic joint tables.

- AuthComponent no longer causes infinite redirects when an ajax request fails and `/` requires authentication. This was a regression in 3.0.7.

As part of the 3.0 patch releases we are experimenting with implementing smaller net new features. We want try delivering new features incrementally. In 3.0.8 the following new features were added:
- The fallback domain for translations can be disabled with
  `I18n::useFallback(false)`.
- PaginatorComponents' `sortWhitelist` option now allows `false` to disable
  sorting entirely.
- Components now have a `response` property set during initialization.
- `cake i18n extract` now generates missing directories.

2.7.0 should be a drop in replacement for your existing 2.5 or 2.6 libraries. In 2.7 the following new features are available.

## Deprecations
- The class `String` has been renamed to `CakeText`. This resolves some  conflicts around HHVM compatibility as well as possibly PHP7+. There is  a `String` class provided as well for compatibility reasons.
- `Validation::notEmpty()` has been renamed to `Validation::notBlank()`.  This aims to avoid confusion around the PHP `notEmpty()` function and that  the validation rule accepts `0` as valid input.
- `SessionComponent::setFlash()` has been deprecated. You should use  `FlashComponent` instead.
- `SessionHelper::flash()` has been deprecated. You should use  `FlashHelper` instead.

## Backported Features From 3.0
- Plugin shells that share a name with their plugin can now be called without  the plugin prefix. For example `Console/cake MyPlugin.my_plugin` can now  be called with `Console/cake my_plugin`.
- `Configure::consume()` has been added to read and delete from  Configure in a single step.
- `CakeSession::consume()` has been added to read and delete from  session in a single step.
- New setting `level` is now available in `TreeBehavior`. You can use it to  specify field name in which the depth of tree nodes will be stored.
- New method `TreeBehavior::getLevel()` has been added which fetches depth of  a node.
- `SessionComponent::consume()` has been added to read and delete  from session in a single step.
- `SessionHelper::consume()` has been added to read and delete from  session in a single step.

## Other Improvements
- SQL datasources will now cast `''` and `null` into `''` when columns are  not nullable and rows are being created or updated.
- Argument `$renew` has been added to `CakeSession::clear()` to allow  emptying the session without forcing a new id and renewing the session. It  defaults to `true`.
- CakeEmail will now use the 'default' config set when creating instances that  do not specify a configuration set to use. For example `$email = new  CakeEmail();` will now use the 'default' config set.
- `ControllerTestCase::testAction()` now supports an array as URL.

If there are no major issues reported in the next 3-4 weeks, a stable release of 2.7.0 will be released.

## Bug Fixes in 3.0.7
- Time validation rules now accept 12:15pm.
- Table names with .'s to access tables in other databases in MySQL, now  correctly generate foreignKeys using conventions.
- `Collection::sumOf()` uses an identity function by default.
- Overlapping irregular inflections are now handled correctly.
- IntegrationTestCase::assertTemplate() now works when a view renders one or more cells.
- Custom fields used in pagination will not be auto-prefixed. This was  a regression introduced in 3.0.6.
- Fixed incorrect `ORDER BY` clauses on SQLServer. Older versions of SQLServer  require that `ORDER BY` expressions not be constant expression.
- Where conditions for columns in belongsToMany junction tables are now properly  type cast to their statement representations.
- Parameter typehints in function expressions are now set correctly.
- `EventManager::off()` can now disable all events of a single type as documented.
- MySQL schema generation for unconventional tables has been improved.
- Radio button sets now always include the hidden field as long as the option is  enabled. This prevents blackholed requests when the current value is outside  of the radio input options.
- Identifier quoting in `ORDER BY` and `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` expressions  is now correct.
- TreeBehavior now aliases the fields used to sort.

## Improvements in 3.0.7
- AssetFilter now supports a `cacheTime` option to control the cache headers.
- RulesChecker features for the ORM were separated into a trait. This makes  rules easier to reuse in other datasources.
- `EventDispatcherInterface` was added. This lets you use `instanceof`  instead of `method_exists` when testing if an object supports events.
- A console output test stub class has been added to help making testing console  applications easier.
- `Collection::extract()` now supports the `{*}` wildcard when extracting  properties.
- Console commands and tasks now support the ability to overwrite all files,  removing the need to answer `y` to each file.
- All tests pass on PHP7.

## Security Fixes

Earlier this week we were notified that RequestHandlerComponent had a vulnerability that would allow well crafted requests to create a denial of service attack. RequestHandlerComponent leverages `Xml::build()` which allows
reading local files. We recommend that all applications using RequestHandlerComponent upgrade, or disable parsing XML payloads. To disable XML payload parsing you can do the following

``` php
// In a controller's beforeFilter
$this->RequestHandler->addInputType('xml', function() { return []; });
```

The above code will replace the built-in XML parsing with a no-op function. We'd like to thank Takeshi Terada for notifying us of this security issue using our [Security Issue Process](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/contributing/tickets.html#reporting-security-issues).

### Bugfixes

You can expect the following changes in 3.0.5. See the [changelog](http://cakephp.org/changelogs/3.0.5) for every commit.
- Filesystem libraries are now available as a standalone package through composer.
- QueryLogger correctly interpolates parameters when there are more than 10  placeholders.
- Datetime inputs correctly render seconds picker elements. Previously they did  not include 00.
- Marshalling belongsToMany `_joinData` was improved. The marshaller now  correctly handles a mix of new and existing entities.
- InstanceConfigTrait deletes nested data correctly now.
- SQLite fixtures now generate primary key columns correctly in all situations.
- Property caching in Entities was made less aggressive. The mutator caches are  now completely invalided when any property is changed.
- Association conditions are no longer used when marshalling existing  belongsToMany records.
- i18n shell creates separate po file entries for messages with differing  contexts.
- The `@` syntax for file uploads in Http\Client was deprecated. Instead you  should use resource handles. The `@` syntax is unsafe with user supplied  data and will be removed in a future version of CakePHP.
- Blob fields in SQLServer are now hexdecoded before being converted into  resource handles.
- FormHelper will not default datetime pickers to 'now' unless the input also  has the `default => true` option supplied. This was done to make it easier  to work with nullable datetime fields.
- QueryExpressions containing subqueries now correctly wrapped in parenthesis.

### Improvements

- `Validator::addNested()` and `Validator::addNestedMany()` were added.  These methods allow you to create validators for nested array properties.
- `Collection::unwrap()` was added.
- `Folder::copy()` now supports a non-recursive mode.
- `Collection::zip()` and `Collection::zipWith()` were added.
- The `__debugInfo()` method was implemented in Form and Validator objects. This  improves DebugKit and `debug()` output.

### Security Fixes

There are two issues that can impact the security of a CakePHP application:
- CsrfComponent fails to invalidate requests that are missing both the CSRF  token, and CSRF post data.
- When marshalling request data, empty entities could by bypass validation  methods with carefully created JSON payloads. RulesChecker validations would  not be bypassed by these empty entities.

We'd like to thank 'Hayato Araki' for contacting us through our [security issue](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/contributing/tickets.html#reporting-security-issues) process about the CsrfComponent issue. We recommend that all users of CakePHP upgrade to 3.0.4 as soon as possible.

### Bugfixes

In addition to the security issues the following defects have been fixed:
- Cascading deletes on associations with custom aliases should no longer fail.
- XmlView now supports `_xmlOptions`. This matches the behavior of JsonView.
- `EntityTrait::extractOriginal()` now behaves consistently with  `extract()`. Both methods now include all named properties, instead of just  the unchanged properties. A new method `extractOriginalChanged()` can be  used to extract only the original values of changed attributes.
- Query string parameters are now correctly supported in  `IntegrationTestCase`.
- `Collection::isEmpty()` and `Cake\ORM\Query::isEmpty()` was added.
- Forms can now be created without the action attribute.
- Accessing entity data is now more efficient. Entities will  cache the result of custom accessors, and invalidate the cache when  properties are changed or removed.

1077640,2015-03-22T16:42:46Z,2015-03-22T17:00:59Z,CakePHP 3.0.0 Released,"CakePHP 3.0.0 Released

The CakePHP core team is thrilled to announce the release of CakePHP 3.0.0. This is the first API stable release for the 3.0 branch. This release is a backwards incompatible release with previous CakePHP versions. The new minimum requirements for CakePHP are:
- PHP 5.4.16 or greater.
- mbstring extension
- intl extension

Some of the key features in CakePHP 3.0 are outlined in the following sections.

# Key Features

## A New ORM

The largest and most exciting change in CakePHP 3.0, is the new ORM. While the Model layer in CakePHP has served the community very well for the past 8 years, we felt there was a big opportunity to learn from the tools other frameworks provide and create a flexible and powerful ORM for CakePHP. We are very proud of the results. The [ORM migration guide](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/orm-migration.html) gives an overview of the new ORM, and how it differs from the old one.

Some of the key features of the new ORM are:
- Use of the [Datamapper Pattern](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/orm.html#models).
- Support for different [eager loading strategies](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/orm/associations.html#hasmany-associations).
- Improved [query building with a fluent interface](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/orm/query-builder.html).
- Embedded support for data post-processing with a [full featured collections library](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/collections.html).
- Support for composite primary keys.
- Ability to both return plain arrays or objects as results.
- [Custom data types](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/orm/database-basics.html#adding-custom-types) logic for casting complex types from, and to, the database.

## Faster and More Flexible Routing

Reverse routing has almost consistent time complexity now. In previous releases reverse routing performance decreased as the number of routes increased. Thanks to named routes and some additional optimizations, routing performance will not degrade even with large numbers of routes.

With the usage of routing scopes, routes can also be parsed and dispatched even faster that in previous releases of CakePHP. You can learn more about the new Router in the [Routing section of the manual](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/development/routing.html).

## Improved Migrations

A more powerful [migrations](https://github.com/cakephp/migrations/) plugin based on [phinx](https://phinx.org/) allows you to easily create and deploy migrations for your application.

## Better Internationalization

The I18n subsystem was completely rewritten to take advantage of the _intl_ PHP extension. This allows CakePHP to offer:
- [Feature-rich translation messages](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/internationalization-and-localization.html#using-variables-in-translation-messages).
- [A locale-aware Time Library](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/views/helpers/time.html).
- [A locale-aware Number Library](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/views/helpers/number.html).

## Improved Debugging Toolbar

DebugKit has been rebuilt for 3.0 and offers more features than ever before with less overhead to your application. DebugKit is installed by default in the new application skeleton.

![DebugKit History Panel](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/_images/history-panel-use.gif).

## Composer Usage

CakePHP, the Application skeleton and several components ([bake](https://github.com/cakephp/bake), [acl](https://github.com/cakephp/acl), [migrations](https://github.com/cakephp/migrations) and [DebugKit](https://github.com/cakephp/debug_kit) are now installed with composer. We recommend using composer for installing CakePHP as it greatly simplifies maintaining the dependencies for your application.

## Standalone libraries

A number of CakePHP libraries have been split out into standalone libraries. Each of these libraries can be used outside of CakePHP applications, or in a 2.x application where you want to start leveraging some of the new features in 3.0.

## View Cells

View cells are small classes that offer controller-like functionality but can be used directly in the view to pull data from any source and render certain template. [Read more about View Cells](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/views/cells.html).

# Getting started

On top of the framework changes, we've created a new repository for the application skeleton[3]. You can install this and the development preview of CakePHP using composer[4]. After downloading and installing composer you can use:

```
$ php composer.phar create-project cakephp/app
```

This will generate a new application, so you can start experimenting with CakePHP 3.0.

# Learn More With the Documentation

Once you have an application started, you can [read the quickstart guide](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/quickstart.html) or [migration guide](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-0-migration-guide.html) to learn more about all the changes and new abilities in CakePHP 3.0.

# Community Plugins

Even though CakePHP 3.0 is young, it already counts on a big community behind it. A big list of plugins has been created for this new version and some of the favorite plugins that are used for version 2 have already been upgraded. You can check the [list of CakePHP 3 community plugins](https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/awesome-cakephp). To get an overview of what is available and what still needs to be upgraded to the new version.

This new release of CakePHP has been a few years in the making and we're very thankful for all the help we've received. From documentation edits, to pull requests and bug reports, we've been impressed with the level of community involvement starting from before the first development preview.

- The postgres driver can now convert text fields into integer fields through SchemaShell.
- Files with .. in their name can now be downloaded through CakeResponse.
- LC_TIME messages are ignored when extracting messages via the I18nShell. Previously, incompatible po files were extracted for LC_TIME messages.
- Fence post errors were fixed in CakeEmail when sending messages with lines equal to 999 bytes.
- Words with WWW in the middle are no longer autolinked by TextHelper.
- PaginatorComponent now handles order conditions like Model::find() does.
- Maxlength attributes are no longer generated by FormHelper for decimal fields. In 2.6.2 maxlength was corrected, however, the fix added in 2.6.2 made it impossible to use the full length of decimal columns.
- The limit and maxLimit settings for PaginatorComponent are now independent.
- Model's whitelist is no longer empty in afterSave.
- Class names in Scaffold errors are now correct.

931448,2015-02-09T01:58:52Z,2015-02-09T02:08:05Z,CakePHP 3.0.0-RC2 released,"The  CakePHP core team is excited to announce the release of CakePHP 3.0.0-RC2. Our plan is that this will be the final 3.0.0 release  candidate and in ~6 weeks time 3.0.0 stable will be released. Since  3.0.0-RC1, we've been hard at work incorporating community feedback,  fixing many issues and improving the documentation.

# Upgrading From an Earlier 3.0.0 release

When upgrading from an earlier 3.0.0 release there are a few important changes you'll need to make.

## Plugin Installation

The use and role of the CakePHP Plugin installer has changed and requires the following updates to your app's composer.json file:

```
""require"": {
    ""cakephp/plugin-installer"": ""*"",
    ""cakephp/bake"": ""dev-master""
},
""scripts"": {
    ""post-autoload-dump"": ""Cake\\Composer\\Installer\\PluginInstaller::postAutoloadDump""
}
```

These  additions will ensure that your plugins continue to install correctly.  Plugins installed with composer will now be installed under `/vendor`.  This change was done to make the separation between external and in-app  plugins clearer. Having both in the same directory was confusing for a  number of users.

## String renamed to Text

In  preparation for PHP7 and HHVM, the String class was renamed to  `Cake\Utility\Text`. The old class name continues to work but will be  removed in a future 3.x release.

## Configuration File Changes

Configuration  files loaded through `Configure::load()` previously required the  extension. The extension being present made switching configuration file  formats hard. For RC2, you must remove the extensions. So  `Configure::read('app.php')` is now `Configure::read('app')`.
PHP  based configuration files should now return their data instead of  setting the `$config` variable. The `$config` variable is now deprecated  and will be removed in a future 3.x release.

## ORM Callback Consistency

The  various ORM callbacks had somewhat inconsistent types used for the  `$options` parameter. All callbacks will now receive an `ArrayObject`  for the `$options` parameter. Query::formatResults() no longer gets the  query as an argument either. If you need access to the query from a  result formatter, use a closure.

## EventManager::detach() and EventManager::attach() are deprecated

These  methods have been replaced with `on()` and `off()`. These new methods  use an interface much like jQuery's methods. `attach()` and `detach()`  are now deprecated and will be removed in a future 3.x release.
We'd like to welcome Jad Bitar (jadb),  Walther Lalk (dakota) and Anthony Grassiot (antograssiot) to the core team. Each of them has helped make 3.0.0 what it is today.

For more details on all the changes in 3.0.0, you should consult the [migration guide](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-0-migration-guide.html). In closing, we'd like to thank all of the people that have helped so far with the 3.0 release.

- Improved web test runner. All URL options now have links in the interface.
- Session directories are now created when debug is enabled.
- Text columns in SQLServer no longer contain length when reflected. The length value was not useful and was causing FormHelper to misbehave.
- AssetDispatcher no longer sets the Content-Length header as it was incorrect when assets included PHP code.
- URL autolinking has been improved.
- Criterion is now correctly inflected.
- Time strings are now correct when mbstring is not installed.
- The exception emitted when headers were sent has been removed. This exception was causing more problems than it was solving, including infinite loops on fatal error pages.
- Radio buttons that are only partially disabled are now added to the list of secured fields.
- MySQL now correctly quotes SET column values.

820491,2015-01-02T19:00:12Z,2015-01-02T19:09:28Z,CakePHP 3.0.0-RC1,"The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the first release candidate for [CakePHP 3.0.0](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/releases/3.0.0-rc1).
It's been an intense time since our last beta release.  We have been busy polishing most of the rough edges that we could find with the help of the community.

This polishing sprint meant a few breaking API breaking changes from beta3, specifically around the validation subsystem, due to many shortcomings found in the previous implementation.

Below the list of new features and changes that made it into 3.0.0-rc1:

### Revamped Validation

The validation process was split into two stages. The first stage is a user-facing type of validation and has not changed since the last release except for where and when it is performed.

In previous versions you would do

``` php
$article = $this->Articles->newEntity($this->request->data);
$this->Articles->save($article, ['validate' => 'myCustomValidatorName']);
```

But now, user-facing validation is performed when creating the entity and not when saving it. This requires you to pass the validation option to either `newEntity` or `patchEntity` methods:

``` php
$article = $this->Articles->newEntity($this->request->data, [
    'validate' => 'myCustomValidatorName'
]);
$this->Articles->save($article);
```

It is important to notice that fields that fail validation will _not_ be copied into the resulting entity.

The second validation step, that we have called ""application rules"", is done when saving or deleting an entity. The rules checking step is meant to check application integrity, such as uniqueness of a column, arity or foreignKey constraints:

``` php
// In UsersTable.php

public function buildRules(RulesChecker $rules) {
    $rules->add($rules->isUnique('email'));
    return $rules;
}
```

Application rules can also be used to enforce business logic constraints such as state machines, and workflow states.

The `validate()` and `validateMany()` methods have been removed from the `Table` class.

You can read more about the application rules system in the [rules checker documentation](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/orm/saving-data.html#applying-application-rules).

### New Error Pages

The error pages containing the exception stack traces have been redesigned to be easier to read and spot what caused the error originally. The new look was inspired by the [Rails' better errors plugin](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3fa6840d5e20236b4f768d6ed4b42421ba7c2f21/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f367a42474141622e706e67)

### New Bake Plugin

The `cake bake` command is now a plugin. This will help us evolve its code at a higher pace and introduce new code generators and configuration options.

One important change concerning bake is that it now uses CakePHP's `View` system to render the templates. This means that it is possible to attach listeners to the `Bake.beforeRender` and `Bake.afterRender` events to modify bake's output.

Additionally, the templating syntax has changed to make them more readable. If you had your own bake templates in the past, they will need to be updated to use the new syntax which uses erb style tags. To get the `Bake` plugin run:

```
composer require cakephp/bake=dev-master --dev
```

And load it in your application `bootstrap_cli.php` file:

`Plugin::load('Bake');`

### Table-less Forms

Due to popular request, there is now a `Form` object that is capable of defining a schema and validating form data without the use of ORM tables or entities:

``` php
public function add()
{
        $contact = new ContactForm();
        if ($this->request->is('post')) {
            if ($contact->execute($this->request->data)) {
                $this->Flash->success('We will get back to you soon.');
                return $this->redirect(['action' => 'add']);
            }
            $this->Flash->error('There was a problem submitting your form.');
        }
        $this->set('contact', $contact);
}
```

You can read more about them here http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/form.html

### Adopted PSR-2

We have recently adopted the [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) coding style standard for CakePHP and all the official plugins. You can read more about the reasoning in [this blog post](http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/jameswatts/2014/12/16/cakephp_3_to_fully_adopt_psr-2)

### ORM Related Improvements
- Added `Query::firstOrFail()`
- Allowing to change the joinType in `TranslateBehavior`
- Implemented `Table::addAssociations()` to add multiple associations at once
- Support for `IS NOT` operator
- It is now possible to call `matching()` and `contain()` for the same association alias.

805748,2014-12-23T16:26:27Z,2014-12-23T16:28:50Z,CakePHP 2.6.0 Released,"The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 2.6.0. There have been a few changes to 2.6.0 since the RC1 release:
- AuthComponent now fires the `Auth.afterIdentify` event after users are logged in.
- HtmlHelper::script() and HtmlHelper::css() no longer share a single asset list for the once option.
- Postgres driver supports sslmode.
- The test suite can now use PHPUnit's phar file.
- The RLIKE operator is now supported by the MySQL driver.
- API documentation improvements
- PaginatorHelper now merges options used for active links with options used for disabled links.

## New Feature Highlight
- `stackTrace()` has been added as a convenience wrapper function for `Debugger::trace()`.
  It directly echos just as `debug()` does. But only if debug level is on.
- `ConsoleOptionParser::removeSubcommand()` was added.
- `Shell::overwrite()` has been added to allow generating progress bars or to avoid outputting
  too many lines by replacing text that has been already outputted to the screen.
- When using AclBehavior, The model's `parentNode()` method now gets the type
  (Aro, Aco) passed as first argument: `$model->parentNode($type)`.
- Schema migrations with MySQL now support an `after` key when adding
  a column. This key allows you to specify which column the new one should be
  added after.
- `Model::save()` had the `atomic` option back-ported from 3.0.
- `CakeRequest::param()` can now read values using :ref:`hash-path-syntax`
  like `data()`.
- `CakeRequest:setInput()` was added.
- `HttpSocket::head()` was added.
- You can now use the `protocol` option to override the specific protocol to
  use when making a request.
- `CakeTime::timeAgoInWords()` now supports `strftime()` compatible absolute
  date formats. This helps make localizing formatted times easier.
- `CakeTime::timeAgoInWords()` now supports a  `relativeStringFuture` option.
  This option is a printf compatible string for outputting future relative time
  date formats. This helps make localizing formatted times easier.
- `Hash::get()` now raises an exception when the path argument is invalid.
- `Hash::nest()` now raises an exception when the nesting operation results in
  no data.
- `HtmlHelper::css()` had the `once` option added. It works the same
  as the `once` option for `HtmlHelper::script()`. The default value is
  `false` to maintain backwards compatibility.
- The `maxlength` attribute will now also be applied to textareas, when the corresponding
  DB field is of type varchar, as per HTML specs.
- New i18n functions have been added. The new functions allow you to include
  message context which allows you disambiguate possibly confusing message
  strings. For example 'read' can mean multiple things in English depending on
  the context. The new `__x`, `__xn`, `__dx`, `__dxn`, `__dxc`, `__dxcn`, and
  `__xc` functions provide access to the new features.
- AuthComponent now triggers the `Auth.afterIdentify` event after successfully
  identifying a user.
- `Model::afterFind()` now always uses a consistent format for afterFind().
  When `$primary` is false, the results will always be located under
  `$data[0]['ModelName']`. You can set the `$this->useConsistentAfterFind = false` to
  restore the original behaviour if your application relies on the old behavior.
- Configure value `I18n.preferApp` can now be used to control the order of translations. If set to true it will prefer the app translations over any plugins' ones.

## Deprecations

In addition to new features, a few features have been deprecated, and will be removed in CakePHP 3.0.0
- `Validation::between` has been deprecated, you should use
  `Validation::lengthBetween` instead.
- `Validation::ssn` has been deprecated and may be provided as standalone/plugin solution.
- The `$confirmMessage` argument of `HtmlHelper::link()` has been
  deprecated. You should instead use key `confirm` in `$options` to specify
  the message.
- The `$confirmMessage` argument of `FormHelper::postLink()` has been
  deprecated. You should instead use key `confirm` in `$options` to specify
  the message.

## The Future of 2.x

With 2.6.0 released, the development branch for 2.7.0 has been created. This branch will be released in 5-6 months and will be another 2.x API compatible release. While the core team doesn't have any large improvements planned for 2.7, there will be some efforts to backport useful features from 3.0 to help you migrate more easily.

A huge thanks to all involved in terms of both contributions through commits, tickets, documentation edits, and those whom have otherwise contributed to the framework. Without you CakePHP wouldn't be possible.

- RequestHandler::startup() failures no longer prevent error pages from rendering. This could happen when custom input parsers were used.
- Fixture baking will now ignore unconventional tables instead of stopping.
- Importing schema from MySQL tables using timestamp columns now works better.

With the release of 2.6.0 complete, this will be the last release of 2.5.x barring any security related issues.

708862,2014-11-17T02:31:29Z,2014-11-17T02:38:14Z,CakePHP 3.0.0-beta3 released,"The CakePHP core team is excited to announce the release of CakePHP 3.0.0-beta3. While we had originally planned on only doing 2 beta releases, we're not entirely satisfied with the current ORM validation workflow, and want to do some additional work there. The new plan is to have at least two RC releases after beta3. The RC releases will be API frozen and no new features or breaking changes will be added.

Since 3.0.0-beta2, we've been hard at work incorporating community feedback, and completing the remaining changes that will break compatibility in a significant way.

# Breaking Changes since 3.0.0-beta2
- Bake templates now use a templating mechanism that involves a pre-parsing steps of the templates. This was done to improve the readability and ease of creating new bake templates. This also means that any custom templates that you may have will need to be updated. 
- The default replacement for `Inflector::slug()` is now `-` instead of `_`.
- `LOG_ERROR` and `TESTS` constants were unused and have been removed.
- `Controller::$actions` was removed and replaced with `Controller::isAction()`. The new method makes it easier to customize which methods your controllers consider to be routable actions.
- `Component::initialize()` is now a post-constructor hook like all other initialize methods.
- Component has a new `beforeFilter()` event listener that is fired _before_ a controllers' `beforeFilter` method is.
- `CakeSession::read()` returns null in all failure scenarios now.
- Controller actions invoked with `requestAction()` must return a Response object now. All other return values will trigger an error.
- Database configuration no longer accepts the `'login'` key. You _must_ use `'username'`. This was changed to resolve inconsistencies across the framework.
- Checkbox and radio inputs are now nested inside their attached label elements. This was done to improve compatibility with a few popular CSS libraries. If you have customized the templates FormHelper uses, you may need to update your templates.
- `Cake\View\Error\MissingViewException` is now `Cake\View\Error\MissingTemplateException` in order to allow `MissingView` to be used for missing view classes.
- Authentication objects that had implemented `logout()` need to be updated to use the new `Auth.logout` event.
- The `App.www_root` configuration value has been renamed to `App.wwwRoot` for consistency reasons.

# New features since 3.0.0-beta2
- `Cake\Cache\EngineFileEngine` now generates directories when debug is off.
- There are several new standalone libraries extracted from CakePHP. The `Cache`, `Log`, `Utility` packages are now installable separately with composer.
- The `pj()` (print json) helper method has been added as a convenience when working in the interactive console or test cases.
- The `Model.initialize` event has been added. This event is fired right after a table's initialize hook has completed, allowing plugins or other listeners to interact with table objects.
- Database connections, cache engines, loggers and email transports can now be configured with a Datasource Name (DSN) using the `url` key. This makes it easier to define configuration in environment variables which is a recommended approach by many Platform as a service providers.
- `Component::initialize()` and `View::initialize()` were added.
- Arbitrary meta tags can be created with `HtmlHelper::meta()`.
- Exceptions are now raised when custom view class cannot be found.
- Request data marshaled into entities is not forcibly cast now. This makes validating entity data a bit easier as entity data more closely represents the original request data.
- The query expression builder now has a `between()` method for generating `BETWEEN` clauses.
- `Cake\ORM\Behavior::initialize()` was added.
- Stack traces are now displayed on fatal errors if xdebug is installed.
- `Request::is()` now caches results in memory.
- AuthComponent has two new events. `Auth.afterIdentify` is fired after a user is identified or logged in. `Auth.logout` is fired when `AuthComponent::logout()` is called.
- SessionComponent is deprecated. Instead you should be using `$this->request->session()` instead.
- Each hasher in the `FallbackHasher` class can have separate options now.

For more details on all the changes in 3.0.0, you can consult the [migration guide](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-0-migration-guide.html). In closing, we'd like to thank all of the people that have helped so far with the 3.0 release. We've made great progress and without your help we wouldn't be here today.

A list of the changes you can expect in 2.5.6 are:
- CakeSession::read() returns null on all failure cases.
- Model::isUnique() now works as validator for multiple fields.
- CakeTestCase::getMockForModel() now injects the test datasource for all connection names.
- Digest Auth now handles `&`, `?` in digest auth data.
- FormHelper no longer generates a hidden input for disabled mulitple checkbox inputs.
- Folder::create() now handles relative paths.
- Stack traces now output more context on exceptions.
- Fatal errors now include stack traces if xdebug is enabled.
- Virtual fields no longer incorrectly replace `IN` clauses.

## Changes in 2.6.0-RC

In addition to the changes in 2.5.6, 2.6.0-RC contains the following changes:
- `Hash::merge()` and `Hash::expand()` are now more performant.
- `TranslateBehavior` properly handles the atomic flag.
- Redis Engine now includes a default prefix based on your application directory. 
- MySQL schema reflection includes comment support now.
- `CakeRoute::__set_state` was added. This helps make it easier to cache routes with `var_export`.
- `CakeResponse::file()` accepts ranges even when the download option is set to `false`.
- `AuthComponent` now has a `userFields` option which allows you to limit which fields are loaded into the session.
- `PaginatorHelper::meta()` has been added. This method helps you easily generate meta tags containing pagination information.

If there are no blocking issues found in the RC release we expect to have a stable 2.6.0 release ready in 3 or 4 weeks.

- Fixed a situation where Hash::remove() would remove data incorrectly.
- UUID columns are now reflected properly by postgres.
- CakeEmail::reset() now resets the email pattern.
- Hash::expand() and Hash::merge() are now much faster.

## New features in 2.6

Like all the other 2.x releases, 2.6.0 will be backwards compatible with previous versions of CakePHP 2.x, and include a number of new enhancements and improvements. Here is what you can expect in 2.6.0:
- `stackTrace()` has been added as a convenience wrapper function for `Debugger::trace()`.
  It directly echos just as `debug()` does. But only if debug level is on.
- `ConsoleOptionParser::removeSubcommand()` was added.
- `Shell::overwrite()` has been added to allow generating progress bars or to avoid outputting
  too many lines by replacing text that has been already outputted to the screen.
- When using AclBehavior, The model's `parentNode()` method now gets the type (Aro, Aco) passed as first argument: `$model->parentNode($type)`.
- Schema migrations with MySQL now support an `after` key when adding
  a column. This key allows you to specify which column the new one should be
  added after.
- `Model::save()` had the `atomic` option back-ported from 3.0.
- `CakeRequest::param()` can now read values using :ref:`hash-path-syntax`
  like `data()`.
- `CakeRequest:setInput()` was added.
- `HttpSocket::head()` was added.
- You can now use the `protocol` option to override the specific protocol to
  use when making a request.
- `CakeTime::timeAgoInWords()` now supports `strftime()` compatible absolute
  date formats. This helps make localizing formatted times easier.
- `CakeTime::timeAgoInWords()` now supports a  `relativeStringFuture` option.
  This option is a printf compatible string for outputting future relative time
  date formats. This helps make localizing formatted times easier.
- `Hash::get()` now raises an exception when the path argument is invalid.
- `Hash::nest()` now raises an exception when the nesting operation results in
  no data.
- `HtmlHelper::css()` had the `once` option added. It works the same
  as the `once` option for `HtmlHelper::script()`. The default value is
  `false` to maintain backwards compatibility.
- The `maxlength` attribute will now also be applied to textareas, when the corresponding
  DB field is of type varchar, as per HTML specs.
- New i18n functions have been added. The new functions allow you to include message context which allows you disambiguate possibly confusing message strings. For example 'read' can mean multiple things in English depending on the context. The new `__x`, `__xn`, `__dx`, `__dxn`, `__dxc`, `__dxcn`, and `__xc` functions provide access to the new features.

A long standing issue in the Model class has been fixed. Because it may be construed as API changes, there is a flag to restore the original behaviour.
- `Model::afterFind()` now always uses a consistent format for afterFind(). When `$primary` is false, the results will always be located under `$data[0]['ModelName']`. You can set the `useConsistentAfterFind` property to false on your models to restore the original behaviour.

In addition to new features, a few features have been deprecated, and will be removed in CakePHP 3.0.0
- `Validation::between` has been deprecated, you should use
  `Validation::lengthBetween` instead.
- `Validation::ssn` has been deprecated and may be provided as standalone/plugin solution.
- The `$confirmMessage` argument of `HtmlHelper::link()` has been
  deprecated. You should instead use key `confirm` in `$options` to specify
  the message.
- The `$confirmMessage` argument of `FormHelper::postLink()` has been
  deprecated. You should instead use key `confirm` in `$options` to specify
  the message.

If the beta release doesn't have any major issues reported, you can expect an release candidate in ~1 month, with a stable release shortly afterwards.

588185,2014-09-28T13:32:51Z,2014-09-28T13:41:55Z,CakePHP 3.0.0-beta2 released,"The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the second beta release for [CakePHP 3.0.0](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/releases/3.0.0-beta2).
It's been a month since our first beta release, and we are excited by the big welcome the community has given to the new version. All the positive feedback and help has been a great motivation for the core team to work harder on improving the developer experience for 3.0.

This will be the last beta release for 3.0, this means that the API is already stabilizing and we're mostly focusing on polishing the current features, performance optimizations, documentation and quickly solving any issues reported in Github.

We've had a very busy month implementing a few missing features we had in our roadmap and upgrading some of the popular plugins for CakePHP.

Below the list of new features and changes that made it into 3.0.0-beta2:

### DebugKit

Debugging CakePHP 3.0 applications is even better. The new DebugKit is easier to install, faster and looks gorgeous.

DebugKit is a application toolbar that collects useful statistics about your code such as time and memory, executed queries, log messages and view variables. To install Debugkit just use

```
composer require cakephp/debug_kit ""3.0.*-dev""
```

And add this line to your bootstrap.php file:

``` php
Plugin::load('DebugKit', ['bootstrap' => true]);
```

If you install a new application using the [app skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/app), DebugKit will be automatically installed for you.

### Database Migrations

[Migrations](https://github.com/cakephp/migrations) is now an official CakePHP plugin. It wraps the excellent [Phinx](http://phinx.org/) library into a CakePHP shell to avoid repeating configuration strings and add some of the cake experience. A database migration generated by this plugin would look like:

``` php
<?php
use Phinx\Migration\AbstractMigration;
class CreateUsersTable extends AbstractMigration {
    /**
     * Change.
     */
    public function change() {
        // create the table
        $table = $this->table('users');
        $table->addColumn('id', 'integer')
            ->addColumn('username', 'string')
            ->addColumn('password', 'string')
            ->addColumn('created', 'datetime')
            ->create();
    }
```

Migrations are reversible. This means that with the same code you can create or rollback the changes done to the database schema.

To install the Migrations plugins run:

```
composer require cakephp/migrations ""dev-master""
```

And add this line to your bootstrap.php file:

``` php
Plugin::load('Migrations');
```

### New Logger interface

CakePHP has adopted the PSR-3 recommendation for loggers. Now all log engines implement the `Prs\Log\LoggerInterface` interface. This means that the entire logging system can easily be replaced by other implementations, such as the popular [Monolog library](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog).

### Integration Tests and Data Integrity

Testing controllers has always been problematic. While `ControllerTestCase` solved some of the problems, we identified this class as a source of problems and confusion among our users. We decided to implement the new `IntegrationTestCase` class as a way totest all aspects of an HTTP request in your application without much mocking being involved. This should help you improve code quality and ensure that your application and routes are working as expected.

We also made the fixtures system better, allowing developers to define and work with foreign key constraints in their database. The fixtures system will now correctly load all data and enable constraints right before your test code is executed.

## New Bake templates

With the date for a stable release getting closer and closer we decided to give a new look to default baked applications. Hopefully the new look will feel fresher, more modern, and easier to work with.

### Separate packages

We've seen an increasing interest in using the new ORM outside the framework or within older CakePHP applications. One of our goals since the start has been making this possible. We have already begun the work to split the framework into various standalone components that can be reused and installed with composer. While the ORM has not yet been extracted into its own repository, most of the necessary pre-requisites are complete. As a product of this work, we have already extracted several components out of the main code base:
- [Collections](https://github.com/cakephp/collection): Provides a set of tools to manipulate arrays or Traversable objects in an efficient and elegant way.
- [Validation](https://github.com/cakephp/validation): The excellent and flexible validation library can now be used in any project!
- [Utility](https://github.com/cakephp/utility): Provides the Hash,  Inflector, String and Xml classes.
- [Event](https://github.com/cakephp/event): Our Signal-Slot (or Observer Pattern) implementation.
- [Core](https://github.com/cakephp/core): The CakePHP core, containing the Configuration and Plugin management classes.

It is important to note that the these repositories are read-only, development will continue in the main CakePHP repository and code will be synchronized regularly to these splits. Please open any ticket or pull request directly in the [main github repository](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

### ORM Related Improvements
- Added `Query::autoFields()`. This controls whether the fields for the main table are automatically selected.
- Ability to pass finder options to custom finders from the paginator by using the `finderOptions` key.
- It is now possible to get the default column values out of the database using the `Schema\Table::defaultValue()`.
- Added `accessibleFields` as an option key for `newEntity()` and `patchEntity()`. This will allow finer grain control for mass-assignment.
- TranslateBehavior automatically finds translations based on the current application locale.
- `Table::findOrCreate()` was added.
- Ability to override the join type for an association using `contain()`

### Plugin Shells

Shells in plugins can now be called without prefixing with the plugin name. For example for a `do_stuff` shell living in the `Tools` plugin, you can execute:

```
bin/cake do_stuff
```

### Other improvements
- New `uploadedFile` validation rule.
- Made String::uuid() 3 times faster.
- Better exception reporting on fatal errors.

510175,2014-08-23T09:25:45Z,2014-08-23T09:39:37Z,CakePHP 3.0.0-beta1 released,"The CakePHP core team is excited to announce the first beta release of CakePHP 3.0.0. In the weeks since 3.0.0-alpha2, we've been hard at work incorporating community feedback on the new release, and completing the remaining changes that will break compatibility in a significant way.

# Breaking Changes since 3.0.0-alpha2

Since the release of 3.0.0-alpha2 there have been several changes that will break compatibility with existing applications.

### I18n has been re-implemented

Built on top of `ext/intl` and `Aura/Intl` the new localization subsystem offers more powerful replacement syntax, and retains a backwards compatible sprintf() based formatter. Consult the [new i18n documentation](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/internationalization-and-localization.html) for more information. The `L10n` class has been removed.

### NumberHelper uses intl now

The `Number` library and `NumberHelper` now use intl internally for formatting currencies and values. This makes NumberHelper completely aware of the application's current locale. The `addFormat()` method has been removed.

### Directory layout changes

More changes to the directory layout of a CakePHP application have been made:
- `src/Config` is now `/config`.
- `src/bootstrap.php` is now `/config/bootstrap.php`.
- Log files are now in a top level directory by default. Having them mixed in with other actually temporary data sometimes resulted in people accidentally deleting their log files.
- Bake templates should now be put in `src/Template/Bake`.

### Vendor Prefixed Plugins Have Changed

Plugins that use vendor prefixes e.g: (`AcmeCorp\Users`) are no longer renamed. Instead of using `Users.User`, you must now use `AcmeCorp/Users.User`.
Additionally the vendor prefix will be used as folder name in the plugins folder, so the plugin will be installed in `plugins/AcmeCorp/Users` folder.

### Methods removed
- Many of the infrequently used methods defined in `basics.php` have been removed. Functions like `config()` no longer exist.
- Validation::ssn() has been removed.
- Helper::webroot(), Helper::assetUrl(), Helper::assetTimestamp() have been moved to a UrlHelper. This allows you to easily replace the URL building features in each of your helpers. You will need to add `Url` to the `$helpers` list in your helpers.
- App::objects() has been removed.

We hope to minimize the impact of breaking changes in future beta and release candidate releases.

# New features in 3.0.0-beta1
- Improved error pages for plugins.
- Numerous bugs have been fixed in the ORM and across the framework.
- Cookie paths are now set to the application's base directory by default.
- Query objects can be json serialized now.
- Shell::param() was added.
- Added a new `collection()` global shorthand function to convert arrays to collections.
- Many API documentation blocks and book sections have been improved.
- Support for `CASE` statements has been added to the ORM.
- Multiple optimizations for performance.

For more details on all the changes in 3.0.0, you can consult the [migration guide](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-0-migration-guide.html). In closing, we'd like to thank all of the people that have helped so far with the 3.0 release. We've made great progress and without your help we wouldn't be here today.

CakePHP 3.0.0-alpha2 is the second alpha release for CakePHP 3.0.0. In the month since 3.0.0-alpha1 a few new features have been merged, and many issues have been fixed.

## New Features in 3.0.0-alpha2

### Router Refactor and Builder Based APIs.

The Router class has been re-factored internally and new methods have been added to allow your routes file to stay DRYer than ever before. In addition to improved methods, the performance of parsing incoming URLs has been greatly improved. Router is stricter about missing routes, and will notify you (via an exception) when a URL cannot be parsed or matched with the connected routes.

The default routes provided by CakePHP have been removed. While helpful in the prototyping stages, these routes created issues with duplicate content and were often not used in larger applications. In their place, a smaller subset of routes is provided to help with the prototype stage of application development. If you have an existing application using 3.0, you will need to update your [routes.php](https://github.com/cakephp/app/blob/master/config/routes.php) file.

### CacheHelper Removed

CacheHelper has been removed from CakePHP. The core team feels that the functionality this helper provided is best handled by standalone servers like [Varnish](http://varnish-cache.org). While we explored building a ESI based replacement for CacheHelper, there were a number of edge cases that would have complicated the implementation.

### ORM Improvements
- Empty associations in BelongsTo and HasOne associations no longer hydrate an empty entity. Instead the association property will be `null`.
- Options for all the various ORM operations are now consistent.
- You can specify a white list of fields when marshaling data out of the request and into entities.
- It is now easier to implement custom column types with the `_initializeSchema` table hook method.
- Query::newExpr() now accepts a SQL expression.
- Conditions with nullable values are easier to build `'field IS' => $val` will generate correct SQL when `$val` is not `NULL`.
- Conditions with `IN` clauses work better with empty data.

### Other Changes
- HtmlHelper and FormHelper had their `$confirmMessage` arguments removed and replaced with `confirm` options.
- Improved errors for Cells.
- Prefixed controllers can now use prefixed layouts which will be checked automatically.
- Cookies are now read and decrypted lazily.
- The `ssl` routing option is now `_ssl`.
- The `[method]` routing option is now `_method`.
- Header based route matching has been removed. It was very infrequently used.
- Router::resourceMap() has been removed. New options for Router::mapResources() replace the need to have this method.
- Bcrypt hashing has been removed from `Security::hash()`

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 2.5.3 and CakePHP 1.3.20. CakePHP 2.5.3 is a bugfix release for the 2.5.x release branch. 1.3.20 is a bugfix release for 1.3.x. The 1.3.20 release contains an important fix to address a potential race condition in Model::save() that can cause data loss when records are deleted during concurrent updates. The same fix is included in 2.5.3.

A short list of the changes you can expect in 2.5.3 are:
- TextHelper::autoLinkEmail() now links email addresses adjacent to HTML elements.
- 'research' is now pluralized by Inflector properly now.
- 'stadium' is now pluralized by Inflector properly now.
- The schema included for the ACL tables now includes indexes to help improve performance.
- APCEngine cache is now compatible with APCu.
- App::pluginPath() is deprecated. You should use Plugin::path() instead.
- API doc blocks have been improved in many classes.
- Email validation rules in CakeEmail have been relaxed. Both email addresses with UTF-8 characters and IDN domain names are generally deliverable but were failing `filter_var()`.
- CakeResponse::sharable() now sets the public max-age header.
- Model::getDataSource() now correctly switches the schemaName property. This fixes a regression introduced in 2.4.8.
- Validation::inList() no longer accepts hexadecimal values for numeric checks.
- Multi use CSRF tokens now have their expiration updated on each request.
- h() now performs better.
- Missing fixture errors have been improved.

394990,2014-06-25T20:14:44Z,2014-06-25T20:18:38Z,CakePHP 3.0.0-alpha1 released,"The CakePHP core team proudly announces the first alpha release of CakePHP 3.0.0. In the months between 3.0.0-dev3 and this release, we've been working really hard at getting more of the remaining parts implemented, and incorporating all the great feedback we've gotten from the community so far.

There are still a few larger features to be completed before we go to a beta release, most importantly:
- Updated i18n and L10n features.
- A replacement for CacheHelper based on Edge Side Includes.
- A new routing API for simpler and faster route declaration.

The alpha releases will focus on getting these key features completed. After which, we'll start beta releases focusing on polishing up any rough or confusing features, improving error messages/help and porting over plugins produced by the core team.

We've been truly humbled by the fantastic feedback and support we've received from the community in the last month. We've had numerous bug reports, pull requests and documentation edits that have helped improve 3.0 overall.

This release also comes with complete documentation for the new features and changes, make sure you check out the new CakePHP 3.0 book to read about them in detail.

Below is the list of new features and changes that made it into 3.0.0-alpha1:

### Reworked Dispatcher Filters

Dispatcher filters have been reworked and expanded to include some of the previously 'magic' features of CakePHP. Filters are now registered as instances instead of through configuration data making it simple to do dependency injection.

Dispatcher filters also include a way to restrict when they are applied to any given request.

### New Session Object

Session management has always been a static class in CakePHP which has proven to be problematic in a number of ways. For CakePHP 3.0, you can access the session from the request object `$this->request->session()`.

This change also makes the session easier to test, and allows CakePHP to use PHPUnit 4.x

### FlashHelper and FlashComponent

Flash messages play an important part in modern web applications. While CakePHP has always had rudimentary flash messaging support, CakePHP 3.0 gives developers even more tools to create and render multiple kinds of messages in a simple way. To make this happen a separate component and helper were created. We'd like to thank jadb and bcrowe for making this code happen.

### CookieComponent

CookieComponent has only been able to manage one cookie namespace at a time in the past. While it offered powerful tools for creating encrypted cookies, those tools were hard to use consistently and correctly. The redesigned CookieComponent makes it much easier to separate the configuration of cookie namespaces and the handling of cookie data.

### Passwords Default to Bcrypt

Using bcrypt for passwords is a current best-practice. To help steer developers in the right direction, we've made bcrypt the default password hashing system in CakePHP, and provided an easy to use FallbackHasher that will allow you to incrementally update your password hashes from older hashing algorithms.

### Themes and Plugins Merged

For CakePHP 3.0.0, we wanted to make themes more powerful and more robust. As we looked at ways of improving themes, we realized that what we really wanted were plugins. To that end, you can now use any plugin as a theme. This makes packaging and re-distributing themes easy as they are simply plugins do and
can include helpers and cells.

### App and Plugins share a standard suggested directory layout

To make your experience developing as consistent as possible, we've updated both the application skeleton and plugin skeletons to use the same directory structure. This will help make working with plugins feel just like you're working in a small modular application.

### ORM Improvements

Several API changes made their way into the new ORM. Now it is simpler to specify deep associations for saving operations and we have changed a couple conventions to reduce the learning curve and confusion among new adopters.

### Better Performance

We've taken an initial performance review over the new features in 3.0, and spent some time removing obvious bottlenecks. We're happy to announce that we succeeded at making the bootstrap process and several parts of the helpers template generation faster.

Additionally, we've identified a way to make the routing process several times faster. We'll be implementing these new ideas for the following beta release.

- TextHelper::tail() was restored.
- FormHelper security tokens only use the path and query parts of a URL to generate hashes. This fixes problems when absolute URL's were used to create forms.
- Missing component error pages have correct paths now.
- Compatibility with PHP5.6 was improved.

2.5.1 contains the following changes:
- Loading data from models and their associations with multiple datasources works properly now. This fixes a regression added in 2.5.0-beta.
- FormHelper::postLink() had a backwards incompatible signature change in 2.5.0-dev. This method is now backwards compatible.

Going forward, 2.4 will only receive security releases. 2.5.1 is a bugfix release for the 2.5 release branch. A short list of the changes you can expect in 2.4.10 is:
- Controller::referer() behaves correctly when local URLs are generated.
- TextHelper::tail() was restored.
- FormHelper security tokens only use the path and query parts of a URL to generate hashes. This fixes problems when absolute URL's were used to create forms.
- Missing component error pages have correct paths now.
- Compatibility with PHP5.6 was improved.

2.5.1 contains the following changes:
- Loading data from models and their associations with multiple datasources works properly now. This fixes a regression added in 2.5.0-beta.
- FormHelper::postLink() had a backwards incompatible signature change in 2.5.0-dev. This method is now backwards compatible.
- CakeEmail now uses the correct mimetype for emails that contain text & html but no attachments. Previously, `multipart/mixed` was used which caused some clients to incorrectly handle email messages.

### New feature highlights

#### Cache::remember()

This method allows you to implement read-through cache operations. For the passed cached key, it will first look for any cached data that is still valid. If not found, a callback method will be executed and its return value stored under the cache key.

You will find this useful for reducing the amount of repetitive code around checking for cache misses.

#### Improved Memcached support

A new Cache engine has been added to provide support for the php extension ext/memcached, which is the faster and better supported extension for utilizing this popular key-value database. In introducing this new adapter, we have deprecated the old Memcache engine and plan for its removal in 3.0.

#### CompletionShell

For shell environments that support command completion such as bash and zsh, we have provided a cake shell that will help you get command and options completion for your cake shells by hitting the tab key. If you have ever wondered what shells are available, or what options they can take, this might be for you. Make sure to check the documentation for more information on how to set this up.

#### Security::encrypt() and AES encrypted cookies

If for any reason you are storing data in cookies that should not be changed by the user, you can now use AES encrypted cookies. This utilizes the new AES-256 encryption offered by the Security class to prevent various classes of attacks, such as cookie tampering.

#### Consistent priorities in global and local events

One limitation in previous CakePHP versions was that listeners attached to the global EventManager would always be called before any other local listeners, despite the priorities. CakePHP 2.5 unifies the priority queue between global and local event listeners. With a single unified set of priorities, you can implement more complex and complete aspect oriented programs.

CakePHP 2.5.0 is now marked as stable. 2.5.x is an API compatible upgrade for the 2.x release series. Make sure you read the [migration guide](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/appendices/2-5-migration-guide.html) as there are a few deprecations you may want to account for. Development has already started on 2.6.0, which will be another API compatible release for the 2.x release series.

A huge thanks to all involved in terms of both contributions through commits, tickets, documentation edits, and those whom have otherwise contributed to the framework. As an entirely community powered project CakePHP relies on your contributions to continue.

305802,2014-05-06T13:45:19Z,2014-05-06T13:59:40Z,CakePHP 3.0.0-dev3 released,"The CakePHP core team proudly announces the third development preview of [CakePHP 3.0.0](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/releases/3.0.0-dev3). In the couple months between 3.0.0-dev2 and this release, we've been working really hard at getting the remaining big parts of the new features we wanted to introduce into the framework.

We have decided to not do a future 3.0.0-dev4 release as everything that was planned for it was already completed. This means that the next release will be 'alpha' and the team will focus mostly on polishing the current features, documentation and porting some of the 2.x plugins. We're really happy with the progress we have made and the pace at which 3.0 is going.

Additionally the team has spent plenty of time incorporating all the community feedback into the new ORM and we're humbled by the amount of people putting some of their time into making it even more comprehensive and easy to use.

This release also comes with full documenation for the new features and changes, make sure you check out the new [CakePHP 3.0 book](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/index.html) To read about them in detail. Below the list of new features and changes that made it into 3.0.0-dev3:

### Console improvements
- New ConsoleIO class added. It is a convenience class containing common method for input/output in shells.
- Console methods will receive passed arguments as function parameters, much like controller actions.
- Adding subcommands for Tasks is now required.
- Possibility to alias any shell command, for example instead of `Console/cake bake model` you could do `Console/cake b model`.

### View Cells

View cells are small classes that offer controller-like functionality but can be used directly in the view to pull data from any source and render certain template. [Read more about View Cells](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/views/cells.html)

### New Time Library

The Time class was completely re-implemented to internally use [Carbon](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon). Whatever the Carbon library and `DateTime` can do, the new Time lib can too. This means that the method in `Time` are no longer static, you need and instance of the object to get access to its methods.

In addition to the new Time class being added, it has been integrated with the ORM, meaning that any timestamp/datetime columns in your entities will be able to leverage the power Cake\Utility\Time provides.

Lastly, the Time lib uses the `intl` php extension to provide reliable locale-aware date formatting which is several times superior to the support that we could offer in the 2.x series.

[Read more about Time](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-utility-libraries/time.html)

### Bake

Bake is finally working again in CakePHP 3.0, but it also brings a nice number of great new features:
- Bake is now pluggable! You can create your own bake tasks and they will be automatically discovered. This means that you can now implement your own `Console/cake bake super_table`
- Ability to bake shells, cells, components, behaviors and more

Additionally we added some other changes:
- Microsoft SQL Server support was added to the new ORM
- TreeBehavior was re-implemented and offers feature parity with its previous version form 2.x
- Both Behaviors and Components have now a `config()` method, configuration using public properties was removed
- Multiple bugfixes in the ORM
- `Collection::nest()` and `Collection::listNested()` were added for dealing with hirarchical data
- `Validator::notEmpty()` was added as a complement to `Validator::allowEmpty()`
- Moved exception files to their corresponding namespaces
- Simplified View objects construction, they are not dependent on controllers anymore
- `Request::isMobile` now uses an external library to correctly match the ever-growing number of mobile devices

### Community plugins

Some have been also very busy catching up with the changes introduced daily in the 3.0 branch. We'd like to mention the [CRUD plugin](http://blog.friendsofcake.org/2014/05/03/crud-v4-crud-view-and-search-cake-3-0.html) which contains a dynamic scaffolding and automatic Admin generator. It may be a great way of getting on into CakePHP 3.0 the fast way.

Dereuromark's [Tools plugin](https://github.com/dereuromark/tools/tree/cake3) seems to be having some interesting activity with some good behaviors ready to use in CakePHP 3.0.

## Up next

Our next release will be marked as alpha and we are going to focus on the following:
- Make the session object live inside the Request object. It will not be static anymore
- Implementing the new middleware layer
- Themes implemented as plugins
- CookieComponent reworked.
- Overhaul i18n to use intl and add support for i18n engines

We'd like to thank everyone who has contributed thoughts, code, documentation or feedback to 3.0 so far. It looks like it is going to be the single most important and feature rich release when it is marked stable!

These releases contain security fixes and are recommended for all CakePHP developers using SecurityComponent. A short list of changes you can expect in 2.4.8 are:
- SQLServer now properly appends the schema name when describing tables.
- Hash::extract() can now match boolean attributes.
- fclose() errors when using shells should no longer happen.
- CakeResponse::file() now throws an exception when paths contain '..'.
- ShellDispatcher now casts argv to an array. This fixes issues when cake console was invoked from a non-cli SAPI.
- TextHelper::autoLink() now correctly links urls with subdomains containing '_'.
- SecurityComponent form tampering hashes now include the URL including the query string as a hash input.

A short list of changes you can expect in 1.3.18 are:
- Model conditions containing `:` or `?` are now handled correctly. This fixes issues around using casting in conditions
- SecurityComponent form tampering hashes now include the URL path as a hash input.

As previously mentioned, a security issue related to the SecurityComponent was fixed. These releases are recommended upgrades for anyone using SecurityComponent. Prior to these relases, forms secured by SecurityComponent could be submitted to any action and handled without error. If applications use multiple POST forms to manipulate the same models, they could be vulnerable to mass assignment issues. Thanks to Kurita Takashi for notifying the CakePHP team of this issue, and suggesting a fix.

A huge thanks to all involved in terms of both contributions through commits, tickets, documentation edits, and those whom have otherwise contributed to the framework. Without you there would be no CakePHP.

221376,2014-03-12T21:12:39Z,2014-03-12T23:01:10Z,CakePHP 3.0.0 dev preview 2 released,"The CakePHP core team is excited to announce the second development preview of CakePHP 3.0.0[1]. In the few months since 3.0.0-dev1, we've been hard at work incorporating community feedback on the ORM, and building out some of the functionality that was missing in the first development preview.

### New features in 3.0.0-dev2
- CakePHP has adopted the PSR-4 autoloader standard. If you are updating, make sure you update composer as well using `composer self-update`.
- The directory structure of both CakePHP and the App skeleton has been simplified a bit thanks to PSR-4.
- The AclComponent has been removed - It will be returning as a plugin.
- The TestShell, and webrunner have been removed in favor of only supporting phpunit from the CLI, and VisualPHPUnit.
- View templates have been moved from View/ to Template/. This was done so the View/ directory would only contain view classes and helpers.
- The HtmlHelper, FormHelper, and SessionHelper use string templates consistently.
- ID attributes are now always generated with `-` instead of CamelCase. This was done to standardize on one convention for CSS selectors.
- API documentation and the cookbook have had many new sections and improvements.
- Scaffold has been removed. Dynamic scaffolding is now available through the CRUD plugin[2] which is already compatible with 3.0.
- The UpgradeShell has been moved into a separate plugin.
- Better debugging output for some complex objects like Entities, Tables and Queries. Also added a special method to control what data is outputed for objects when using the debug() function
- Added Collection::insert()

#### FormHelper

FormHelper has been re-built from the ground up. It features a new extensible widget system. Form widgets allow you to build self contained input widgets. This makes it easy to define complex widgets like the datetime widget in application or plugin code. Once created, widgets can be combined with other FormHelper features like `input()`.

FormHelper also works with the new ORM now. You can create forms for individual entities, or collections of entities:

```
// Create a form for a single entity & its associations
echo $this->Form->create($article);

// Create a form for multiple entities & their associations.
echo $this->Form->create($articles);
```

FormHelper also features a pluggable context system that allows you to integrate FormHelper with any ORM you may wish to use.

#### TranslateBehavior

TranslateBehavior has been re-built from the ground up. It features the long awaited ability to translate _all_ models including associations from a find(). The new `TranslateTrait` makes dealing with multiple translations in your entities simple as well.

#### ORM improvements

We've continued to build out capabilities in the ORM. Some notable improvements in dev2 were:
- Composite primary key support - The ORM now supports composite primary keys in all associations.
- The Model.beforefind event is now triggered for all associations in the same query.
- Eager loading is now separate from the Query class. This makes implementing custom eager loading much easier.
- Model/Repository was renamed to Model/Table. Several people found 'Repository' to be a confusing and alien term.
- Interfaces have been extracted to reduce the reliance on concrete implementations.
- The formatResults() method has been added to provide many of the features that afterFind() used to do.
- Query::counter() was added to provide support for complex count logic. This makes it easier to override the count in the PaginatorComponent.
- Table::patchEntity() was added, it enables you to merge requet form data into an existing entity and its associations.

### Up next

Our next release will be yet another development preview. In the dev3 release we are going to focus on updating:
- Bake and all the related tasks need to be updated to work with the new ORM.
- Update the i18n extract task to extract validation messages from Table objects
- Add support for SQLServer. With the database layer reasonably stable adding SQLServer will help developers on windows.

For more details on all the changes in 3.0.0, you can consult the migration guide[2]. I'd like to thank everyone who has contributed thoughts, code, documentation or feedback to 3.0 so far. It's going to be a major milestone for the project, and we're just getting started with making it the best version of CakePHP ever.

- Generated DOM ids for radios and checkboxes should now be collision free when using non-alphanumeric values.
- The postgres driver now quotes schema names. This solves issues with legacy schemas using special characters.
- Translate behavior now correctly handles translated values of '0'.
- Controller baking now provides better feedback when no controllers are generated.
- Datetime inputs will not select year 0 when the selected value is '0000-00-00'. This improves compatibility with MySQL.
- Schema creation with the connection parameter now works as expected.
- URLs are no longer double URL decoded. This fixes lost data when named parameters or path segments contain values that look like URL encoded data.
- Model::updateCounterCache() no longer triggers a notice error when $this->data is empty.

138245,2014-01-05T21:37:10Z,2014-01-05T21:54:26Z,CakePHP 3.0.0 dev preview 1 released,"The CakePHP core team is very excited to announce the first development preview of CakePHP 3.0[1]. The team has been hard at work for the while, and we're very excited and pleased with the progress we've made so far. Our goal with development preview releases like this is to gather early feedback about the changes coming in CakePHP 3.0. While a number of things will be changing in CakePHP 3.0, our focus for this release has been the ORM.

The Model layer in CakePHP has served the community very well for the past 8 years, but it has started to show its age. One of the goals of CakePHP 3.0 is to replace the ageing ORM with a more modern object-orientated implementation. This development preview has the underpinnings of the new ORM. The ORM has many of the features/methods you can expect in future 3.0 release, albeit with a few rough spots.

CakePHP 3.0 represents a significant break in backwards compatibility. One of the largest the project has ever had. We're trying to modify existing methods and classes only where it's required. However, modernizing the ORM has caused a significant ripple effect to other parts of the framework. You can expect fairly significant changes in everything that touches the ORM/Models as we've started over and built what we will become a great ORM.

## Still a preview

We'd like to remind you that this is a development preview release. Many features are incomplete or missing. For example, the `TreeBehavior` and `TranslateBehavior` do not yet have 3.x versions. This release is **not** intended for production use, and should be considered alpha software. We are hoping that by releasing preview releases we can get feedback from you - the community - about CakePHP 3.0. The following features are known to be incomplete or broken. We will not be accepting any bug reports on these features at this time:
- `Console/cake bake` does not work at this time.
- FormHelper does not work with the new ORM yet.
- SchemaShell has been removed.
- Scaffold has been removed.
- Many behaviors have been removed or are not working.
- AclComponent is not working with DbAcl.

In addition to incomplete subsystems, many subsystems have had breaking API changes made to them. We recommend you checkout the migration guide[2] for more detail on which methods/classes have been changed.

### Other improvements

In addition to the ORM we've improved other parts of the framework. A short list of improvements you an expect are:
- Reverse routing has almost consistent time complexity now. In previous releases reverse routing performance decreased as the number of routes increased. Thanks to named routes and some additional optimizations routing performance should stay more consistent even with large numbers of routes.
- Routing prefixes now map to controllers in sub-namespaces and not prefixed methods.
- New HTTP client. The HttpSocket class has been entirely re-written. It is now simpler, more performant and easier to use.
- Simplified configuration. While CakePHP does not have much configuration required. The configuration it does have is now much simpler and more transparent than ever before.
- Community standards adopted. CakePHP is leveraging PSR-0, PSR-1 and composer support.
- Streamlined events system. The events system is now simpler and more efficient than ever before.

## Getting started

On top of the framework changes, we've created a new repository for the application skeleton[3]. You can install this and the development preview of CakePHP using composer[4]. After downloading and installing composer you can use:

```
$ php composer.phar create-project -s dev cakephp/app
```

This will generate a new application, so you can start experimenting with CakePHP 3.0.

## Documentation online

While this is a preview release, we have been busy building documentation alongside the code changes. The in-development book[5] and API[6] are already online. They will be receiving frequent updates as more documentation and examples are written.

## Getting involved

If you're as excited about CakePHP 3.0 as we are, there are many ways you can get involved. You could help with the open issues in github[7], or provide your thoughts on any of the open RFC/Enhancement tickets. Both of these help us design and build the best framework we can. If you're reading through the documentation and notice an error, please let us know, either by opening an issue or sending a pull request.

I'd like to thank everyone who has contributed thoughts, code, documentation or feedback to 3.0 so far. It's going to be a major milestone for the project, and we're just getting started with making it the best version of CakePHP ever.

### Security disclosure

In 2.3.8 a security issue in AssetDispatcher was fixed. In the spirit of being open and transparent a more detailed description of the issue is being provided. By carefully crafting a URL the AssetDispatcher would allow arbitrary file access. A successful attack required at least one theme or plugin to be in use. An example url would look like:

```
http://example.com/DebugKit/%2e.//%2e.//%2e.//%2e.//%2e.//%2e.//%2e.//%2e.//%2e.//%2e.//%2e.//%2e.//%2e./etc/passwd
```

AssetDispatcher incorrectly checked for directory traversal before decoding the URL. We'd like to thank Takeshi Terada of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc for notifying us of the issue.

## CakePHP 2.4.0

CakePHP 2.4.0 is now marked as stable. It is a new version in the 2.x series that is API compatible with other releases in the 2.x series. Make sure you read the migration guide [2] before upgrading as there are a few changes you may need to make.

A quick overview of the changes in 2.4 are:
- The constants IMAGES_URL, JS_URL, CSS_URL have been deprecated and replaced with config variables App.imageBaseUrl, App.jsBaseUrl, App.cssBaseUrl respectively. Each of the deprecated constants will be removed in 3.0.
- The CAKEPHP_SHELL constant has been deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.
- Sanitize class has been deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.
- FileLogs can now have a max size and simple rotation configured.
- Logging now support syslog out of the box.
- A number of locales have been renamed.
- JSONP support has been added to the JsonView
- You can disable updating counterCache values with the `counterCache` option when saving models.
- Password hashing has been extracted into a set of PasswordHasher classes. These classes make changing out password hashing strategies for the various authentication adapters simple.
- Stateless authentication has been improved.

For a full list of the changes and improvements you should review the 2.4 Migration guide [2].

### Changes to 2.4.0 since 2.4.0-RC2
- confirm handlers are now correctly encoded.
- Helpers are now loaded during View construction. This ensures that helpers are always available.
- View blocks can now operate on any object that can be converted to a string.

## CakePHP 2.3.10

2.3.10 marks the end of normal bug fix releases for 2.3.x. Security fixes will continue to be released for 2.3.x until 2.6.0. The following is a short list of issues fixed and changes you can find in 2.3.10
- Configuration values are now merged between Emails and their transports.
- CakeTime::timeAgoInWords() now uses 'about X ago' when the time delta is lower than accuracy.
- DbAcl now uses INNER joins instead of LEFT joins. This yields improved performance with some database vendors.
- CakeEmail::template() can now disable the layout as documented.
- Number formatting in locales that use ',' for a decimal separator is now correct.
- RedirectRoute now honors the 'persist' parameter correctly.
- Constants are now conditionally defined in ShellDispatcher.
- session.auto_start is no longer set as it never worked and triggers errors in PHP 5.5.
- Sqlite now generates schema correctly when BIGINT columns are used as a primary key.
- FileCache now removes special characters that would cause issues on windows systems.
- i18n shell now correctly extracts categories other than LC_MESSAGES.

Development continues to progress on 3.0 with pull requests being frequently opened. Work has also begun on 2.5, another API compatible release in the 2.x line of releases. A huge thanks to all involved in terms of both contributions through commits, tickets, documentation edits, and those whom have otherwise contributed to the framework. Without you there would be no CakePHP. Download a packaged release [3].

4219,2013-07-05T02:07:25Z,2013-07-05T02:12:17Z,CakePHP 2.4.0-beta,"The 2.4.0-beta release contains several new features that improve CakePHP's performance, security and ease of use. When done, this new version is intended to be a replacement for the 2.3.x branch. A [migration guide is provided in the book](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/appendices/2-4-migration-guide.html) and we encourage you to read it if you are upgrading from an older version.

The current list of the new features & changes you can expect in 2.4.0:

## Console
- Logged notice messages will now be colourized in terminals that support colours.

### SchemaShell
- `cake schema generate` now supports the `--exclude` parameter.

### BakeShell
- `cake bake model` now supports baking `$behaviors`. Finding `lft`, `rght` and `parent_id` fields in your table it will add the Tree behavior, for example. You can also extend the ModelTask to support your own behaviors to be recognized.

### FixtureTask
- `cake bake fixture` now supports a `--schema` parameter to allow baking all fixtures with noninteractive ""all"" while using schema import.

### Object
- `Object::log()` had the `$scope` parameter added.

## Components

### AuthComponent
- AuthComponent now supports proper stateless mode when using `Basic` or `Digest` authenticators. Starting of session can be prevented by setting `AuthComponent::$sessionKey` to false. Also now when using only `Basic` or `Digest` you are no longer redirected to login page. For more info check the `AuthComponent` page.
- Property `AuthComponent::$authError` can be set to boolean `false` to suppress flash message from being displayed.

### PasswordHasher
- Authenticating objects now use new password hasher objects for password hash generation and checking.

## Models
- `Model::save()`, `Model::saveField()`, `Model::saveAll()`,
  `Model::saveAssociated()`, `Model::saveMany()` now take a new `counterCache` option. You can set it to false to avoid updating counter cache values for the particular save operation.
- `Model::clear()` was added.

## Datasource
- Mysql, Postgres, and SQLserver now support a 'settings' array in the connection definition. This key => value pair will be issued as `SET` commands when the connection is created.

## View

### JsonView
- JSONP support has been added to :php:class:`JsonView`.

### HtmlHelper
- The API for `HtmlHelper::css()` has been changed.
- New option `escapeTitle` added to `HtmlHelper::link()` to control escaping of only link title and not attributes.

### TextHelper
- `TextHelper::autoParagraph()` has been added. It allows to automatically convert text into HTML paragraphs.

### PaginatorHelper
- `PaginatorHelper::param()` has been added.

## Network

### CakeRequest
- `CakeRequest::param()` has been added.
- `CakeRequest::is()` has been modified to support an array of types and will return true if the request matches any type.
- `CakeRequest::isAll()` has been added to check that a request matches all the given types.

### CakeEmail
- Logged email messages now have the scope of `email` by default. If you are not seeing email contents in your logs, be sure to add the `email` scope to your logging configuration.

### HttpSocket
- `HttpSocket::patch()` has been added.

## L10n
- `ell` is now the default locale for Greek as specified by ISO 639-3 and `gre` its alias.
  The locale folders have to be adjusted accordingly (from `/Locale/gre/` to `/Locale/ell/`).
- `fas` is now the default locale for Farsi as specified by ISO 639-3 and `per` its alias.
  The locale folders have to be adjusted accordingly (from `/Locale/per/` to `/Locale/fas/`).
- `sme` is now the default locale for Sami as specified by ISO 639-3 and `smi` its alias.
  The locale folders have to be adjusted accordingly (from `/Locale/smi/` to `/Locale/sme/`).
- `mkd` replaces `mk` as default locale for Macedonian as specified by ISO 639-3.
  The corresponding locale folders have to be adjusted, as well.
- Catalog code `in` has been dropped in favor of `id` (Indonesian),
  `e` has been dropped in favor of `el` (Greek),
  `n` has been dropped in favor of `nl` (Dutch),
  `p` has been dropped in favor of `pl` (Polish),
  `sz` has been dropped in favor of `se` (Sami).
- Kazakh has been added with `kaz` as locale and `kk` as catalog code.
- Kalaallisut has been added with `kal` as locale and `kl` as catalog code.

## Logging
- Log engines do not need the suffix `Log` anymore in their setup configuration. So for the FileLog engine it suffices to define `'engine' => 'File'` now. This unifies the way engines are named in configuration (see Cache engines for example). Note: If you have a Log engine like `DatabaseLogger` that does not follow the convention of using the  `Log` suffix, you will have to adjust your class name to `DatabaseLog`. You should also avoid class names like `SomeLogLog` which include the suffix twice at the end.

### FileLog
- Two new config options `size` and `rotate` have been added for `FileLog` engine.

### SyslogLog
- The new logging engine `SyslogLog` was added to stream messages to syslog.

## Utility
- `pr` no longer outputs HTML when running in cli mode.

### Validation
- `Validation::date()` now supports the `y` and `ym` formats.
- The country code of `Validation::phone()` for Canada has been changed from `can` to `ca` to unify the country codes for validation methods according to ISO 3166 (two letter codes).

### CakeNumber
- The currencies `AUD`, `CAD` and `JPY` have been added.
- The symbols for `GBP` and `EUR` are now UTF-8. If you upgrade a non-UTF-8 application, make sure that you update the static `$_currencies` attribute with the appropriate HTML entity symbols (`&#163;` and `&#8364;`) before you use those currencies.

### CakeTime
- `CakeTime::isPast()` and `CakeTime::isFuture()` were added.

### Xml
- New option `pretty` has been added to `Xml::fromArray()` to return nicely formatted Xml.

## Error

### ErrorHandler
- New configuration option `skipLog` has been added, to allow skipping certain Exception types to be logged. `Configure::write('Exception.skipLog', array('NotFoundException', 'ForbiddenException'));` will skip logging these exceptions and the ones extending them when `'Exception.log'` config is `true`

## Routing

### Router
- `Router::baseUrl()` was added. This method replaces `FULL_BASE_URL`. Which is now deprecated.

The API docs and cookbook have been updated to reflect the changes and updates for 2.4.0.

4216,2013-07-05T02:05:00Z,2013-07-05T02:09:58Z,CakePHP 2.3.7,"2.3.7 is a bugfix release for the 2.3 branch, while 2.4.0-beta is the first release of the 2.4 branch. A short list of the changes you can expect in 2.3.7 are:
- Cached views now contain their Content-Type header. It is recommended that you flush your view caches when upgrading.
- Return-Path is now excluded on emails delivered via SMTP.
- The automatic created & modified times when saving records are now consistent. There used to be an edge case where they could differ by one second.
- Undocumented, untested features around the IIS_SERVER constant have been removed.
- FormHelper::dateTime() now selects the correct year when creating an input which has a maxYear earlier than the current year.
- Email views now calculate the boundary later in the rendering process fixing issues where View callbacks could append inline images or attachments, resulting in incorrect boundary markers.
- AuthComponent now correctly generates redirect URL's when the application base path matches the controller name.
- Errors generated from requests containing 'index.php' now render correctly.
- Classnames containing '..' are now rejected.

There was a security fix in this release that fixes an issue where controllers outside of the application could be loaded under certain conditions. This is an important upgrade for applications that accept uploaded PHP files where user data is used to determine the final file name. In these situations it would be possible for an attacker to upload a PHP file and remotely execute code. A big thanks to Adrian Ulrich for contacting us about the issue, and providing steps to reproduce it.

In the previous release for 1.3.16 a mistake was made when creating the 1.3.16 tag. An important fix was missed from the packaged release. We recommend that all applications using 1.3 upgrade to 1.3.17 immediately safeguard against the SQL injection issue that 1.3.16 was intended to fix.

## How did this happen?

When creating the package for 1.3.16, a git clone was not correctly updated before generating the new tag. To prevent this issue in the future, we'll be updating the automated build script used to package CakePHP to always update the local clone. This should prevent similar errors in the future.
