_Note: These release notes include all changes since 3.6.1, including the changes that were first published in 3.7.0.beta1._

### Deprecations:
- The `set :scm, ...` mechanism is now deprecated in favor of a new SCM plugin system. See the [UPGRADING-3.7](UPGRADING-3.7.md) document for details

### Potentially breaking changes:
- The `:git_strategy`, `:hg_strategy`, and `:svn_strategy` settings have been removed with no replacement. If you have been using these to customize Capistrano's SCM behavior, you will need to rewrite your customization using the [new plugin system](http://capistranorb.com/documentation/advanced-features/custom-scm/)
- `remote_file` feature has been removed and is no longer available to use @SaiVardhan

### New features:
- The `tar` used by the Git SCM now honors the SSHKit command map, allowing an alternative tar binary to be used (e.g. gtar) #1787 (@caius)
- Add support for custom on-filters [#1776](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/issues/1776)

### Fixes:
- Fix test suite to work with Mocha 1.2.0 (@caius)
- Fix bug where host_filter and role_filter were overly greedy [#1766](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/issues/1766) (@cseeger-epages)
- Fix the removal of old releases `deploy:cleanup`. Logic is changed because of unreliable modification times on folders. Removal of directories is now decided by sorting on folder names (name is generated from current datetime format YmdHis). Cleanup is skipped, and a warning is given when a folder name is in a different format

**You'll notice a big cosmetic change in this release: the default logging
format has been changed to
[Airbrussh](https://github.com/mattbrictson/airbrussh).** For more details on
what Airbrussh does
and how to configure it, visit the
[Airbrussh README](https://github.com/mattbrictson/airbrussh#readme).
- To opt out of the new format, simply add `set :format, :pretty` to switch to
  the old default of Capistrano 3.4.0 and earlier.
- If you are already an Airbrussh user, note that the default configuration has
  changed, and the syntax for configuring Airbrussh has changed as well.
  [This simple upgrade guide](https://github.com/mattbrictson/airbrussh/blob/master/UPGRADING-CAP-3.5.md)
  will walk you through it.

### Potentially breaking changes:
- Drop support for Ruby 1.9.3 (Capistrano does no longer work with 1.9.3)
- Git version 1.6.3 or greater is now required
- Remove 'vendor/bundle' from default :linked_dirs (@ojab)
- Old versions of SSHKit (before 1.9.0) are no longer supported
- SHA1 hash of current git revision written to REVISION file is no longer abbreviated
- Ensure task invocation within after hooks is namespace aware, which may require
  you to change how your `after` hooks are declared in some cases; see
  [#1652](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/issues/1652) for an example
  and how to correct it (@thickpaddy)
- Validation of the `:application` variable forbids special characters such as slash,
  this may be a breaking change in case that you rely on using a `/` in your application
  name to deploy from a sub directory.

### New features:
- Added a `doctor` task that outputs helpful troubleshooting information. Try it like this: `cap production doctor`. (@mattbrictson)
- Added a `dry_run?` helper method

- Allow after() to refer to tasks that have not been loaded yet (@jcoglan)
- Allow use ""all"" as string for server filtering (@theist)
- Print a warning and abort if ""load:defaults"" is erroneously invoked after
  capistrano is already loaded, e.g. when a plugin is loaded in `deploy.rb`
  instead of `Capfile`. (@mattbrictson)
- Added option to set specific revision when using Subversion as SCM (@marcovtwout)
- Deduplicate list of linked directories
- Integration with Harrow.io (See http://capistranorb.com/documentation/harrow/) when running `cap install`
- Added validate method to DSL to allow validation of certain values (@Kriechi)
  - validate values before assignment inside of `set(:key, value)`
  - should raise a `Capistrano::ValidationError` if invalid
- Added default validation for Capistrano-specific variables (@Kriechi)

### Fixes:
- Capistrano is now fully-compatible with Rake 11.0. (@mattbrictson)
- Fix filtering behaviour when using literal hostnames in on() block (@townsen)
- Allow dot in :application name (@marcovtwout)
