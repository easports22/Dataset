> The most greatest update on Medoo history. This version included a lot of significant improvements that obviously increasing the performance and flexibility. We also redesign our official website, providing better useful content for documentation.

### Prepared statement ready
Medoo is now using prepared statement for inside query execution. This will increase the query performance and also prevent SQL injection.

### Add supported for data type declaration
```php
$data = $database->select(""post"", [
	""[>]account"" => [""user_id""]
], [
	""post.post_id"",
 
	""profile"" => [
		""account.age [Int]"",
		""account.is_locked [Bool]"",
		""account.userData [JSON]""
	]
], [
	""LIMIT"" => [0, 2]
]);
 
echo json_encode($data);

// Output data
[
	{
		post_id: ""1"",
		profile: {
			age: 20,
			is_locked: true,
			userData: [""foo"", ""bar"", ""tim""]
		}
	},
	{
		post_id: ""2"",
		profile: {
			age: 25,
			is_locked: false,
			userData: [""mydata1"", ""mydata2""]
		}
	}
]
```

### Add supported for LOBs and resources data type for insert() and update()
```php
class Foo {
	var $bar = ""cat"";
 
	public function __wakeup()
	{
		$this->bar = ""dog"";
	}
}
 
$object_data = new Foo();
 
$fp = fopen($_FILES[ ""file"" ][ ""tmp_name"" ], ""rb"");
 
$database->insert(""account"", [
	// String value
	""user_name"" => ""foo"",
 
	// Integer value
	""age"" => 25,
 
	// Boolean value
	""is_locked"" => true,
	
	// Array value
	""lang"" => [""en"", ""fr"", ""jp"", ""cn""],
 
	// Array value encoded as JSON
	""lang [JSON]"" => [""en"", ""fr"", ""jp"", ""cn""],
 
	// Object value
	""object_data"" => $object_data,
 
	// Large Objects (LOBs)
	""image"" => $fp
]);
```

### Logging option
We added a logging option for initialization. Logging feature will be disabled for better performance and less memory consumption.

```php
$database = new Medoo([
	""database_type"" => ""mysql"",
	""database_name"" => ""name"",
	""server"" => ""localhost"",
	""username"" => ""your_username"",
	""password"" => ""your_password"",
 
	// Enable logging
	""logging"" => true,
]);
```

### New query() API, supports prepared statement
```php
$data = $database->query(
	""SELECT * FROM account WHERE user_name = :user_name AND age = :age"", [
		"":user_name"" => ""John Smite"",
		"":age"" => 20
	]
)->fetchAll();
```

### Additional changes
- Supports JSON decode
- Supports multiple GROUP by
- Improve MATCH full-text search
- Improve data mapping performance
- Improve all regex matching
- Improve MSSQL and Oracle database support

### Upgrading Medoo 1.2 to Medoo 1.4
There is only one change required
```php
// From
$database->insert(""account"", [
	""user_name"" => ""foo"",
	""email"" => ""foo@bar.com"",
	""age"" => 25,
	""(JSON) lang"" => [""en"", ""fr"", ""jp"", ""cn""]
]);

// To
$database->insert(""account"", [
	""user_name"" => ""foo"",
	""email"" => ""foo@bar.com"",
	""age"" => 25,
	""lang [JSON]"" => [""en"", ""fr"", ""jp"", ""cn""]
