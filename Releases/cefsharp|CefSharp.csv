**Notes**
- `Chromium` has removed support for `Windows XP`, `Windows Vista`, `Windows Server 2003` and `Windows Server 2008`.
  https://chrome.googleblog.com/2015/11/updates-to-chrome-platform-support.html
- Due to licensing issues default builds do not support proprietary codecs like `H264` and `MP3`, sites like `Netflix/Twitter/Instagram` won't play video/audio. See #1479 for more info.
- `CEF` has switched from using breakpad to crashpad for error reporting see https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/CrashReporting.md for details
- As part of this release new sections have been added to the [General Usage Guide](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/wiki/General-Usage)
- This release was funded using [Bounty Source](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/42381776-funding-request-release-57-0-0) A big thank you to all those who contributed!
- This project now uses `GitLink` for better debugging, see #1680
- The `chrome_elf.dll` is now **required**, it's used for crashpad (crash reporting). 
- Minimal designer support has been added to the `WPF` and `WinForms` projects (Thanks go to @merceyz)
- `Scheme` handlers can now be registered as `secure`, newly added feature to `CEF`

**Known Issues**
- `WinForms` when running on `Windows 10 Anniversary` pressing certain key combinations freezes the browser see #1822 The issue has been reported `upstream`, there are workarounds listed in #1822
- `WPF/OffScreen` PDF Scrolling isn't working properly with the mouse wheel see #1916 for details, needs to be fixed in CEF. Use the `WinForms` version hosted in `WPF` as a workaround for now.
- See https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aknown-issue for other known issues

**Breaking Changes**
- `CefSharp` requires at least `.Net 4.5.2` (Last version to support `.Net 4.0` is `49`)
- Removed ` IBrowserSettings.CaretBrowsing ` (CEF API changed)
- Removed ` WindowOpenDisposition.SuppressOpen` (CEF API changed)
- Removed `Plugin` class and replace with WebPluginInfo` (Was duplication in `CefSharp API`)

**Known Issues**

- Upgraded to [CEF 3.1547.1412](http://www.magpcss.net/cef_downloads), which provides Chromium 29 support as well as support for x64. [@plundberg]

- #209: Support for `ExecuteScriptAsync()` and `EvaluateScript()` in the WPF WebView, making it possible to support more trivial JS integration scenarios. [@plundberg]
