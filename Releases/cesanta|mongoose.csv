## STM32 support added

Mongoose 6.6 can be built and run on STM32 microcontrollers. Check out the new example [here](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/tree/master/examples/STM32F4_CC3100) for an MQTT Client for STM32. The example runs through how to build an MQTT client for STM32 with TI CC3100 WIFI as network module.

## PIC32 support added

We’ve also added PIC32 support to Mongoose. And just as for STM32, we have a new example [here](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/tree/master/examples/PIC32/) for you to follow here. It runs through how an MQTT Client is intended for running on PIC32 (MX series with TI CC3100 as a network module).

## TI CC3200 support improved

We have improved the already support TI CC3200. Here, the TI Compiler on docker image was updated to version 5.8.2. 

## New API introductions

We want to make Mongoose as simple as possible to use. Check out the new API we’ve added in 6.6: 
- `mg_http_send_redirect` -  sends a redirect response 
- `mg_http_serve_file` - serves a specific file with a given MIME type and optional extra headers.
- `MG_F_ENABLE_BROADCAST` - new flag, allows to send broadcast messages
- `MG_EV_SSI_CALL_CTX` - new event, the variant of MG_EV_SSI_CALL with context of the SSI call being processed in addition to the tag argument.

## New Examples

We mentioned the STM32 an PIC32 examples already, but they are not all! Check out these additional examples to help you get started with your embedded project: 
- [DLL/SO building example](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/tree/master/examples/dll) 
- [Simple SSL Web Server: shows how to build a http server with SSL support](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/tree/master/examples/simplest_web_server_ssl)
- [A cookie auth and session management example](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/tree/master/examples/cookie_auth) 
- [Multicast server demo](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/tree/master/examples/mcast_udp_server) 

## Bugfixes

We always improve bugs along the way between releases. If you come across anything, let us know in our forum. 
- Use gethostbyname to resolve `hocalhost` if resolving via /etc/hosts failed. (especially useful for Windows users)
- Fixed a lot of errors and warning in MSVC compilation
- Fixed bug in multithreaded mode support:
  - Copy flags for accepted connection
  - Use user timeout in multithreading polling
- Smaller bug fixes

## Documentation

We want you to be able to find all the answers you need in our documentation. That’s why we try to improve it as best we can. So you’ll see that we have more clear and structured documentation available as well as explanations for each example added directly in our documentation section.

- WebDAV support improvements. With a just a couple of lines of code your web server is ready to serve WebDAV and can be mounted as a network drive in very different clients, like Finder on MacOS, Explorer on Windows and Nemo, Nautilus (and others) on Linux. Just add `dav_document_root` to initialization parameters and your are ready to go. See [simplest_web_server example](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/blob/master/examples/simplest_web_server/simplest_web_server.c).
- Timer support. Mongoose 6.2 introduces new event - `MG_EV_TIMER`. With event and new API function `mg_set_timer` things like connection timeout (and a lot of another timeout-related features) can be easily implemented. Call `mg_set_timer(my_connection, time(NULL) + N)` and my_connection will receive MG_EV_TIMER once N seconds is elapsed. Sub-second precision is also supported, and the `mg_time` function which returns current time as a fraction floating point value has been added.
  See [API documentation](https://www.cesanta.com/developer/mongoose#_mg_set_timer) for more details.

Other changes:
- `MG_EV_CLOSE` is now always delivered before connection is destroyed. This should simplify cleanup.
- New API function: `mg_url_decode` to decode URL-encoded string.
- g++ and Microsoft Visual Studio support was improved

    non-blocking, asynchronous, one thread for all.
- API modification for server creation and response creation. That allowed
   keep-alive support for dynamic requests, boosting the embedded performance
   to 100+ thousands requests per second on a single core
   (as measured on my development MacBook laptop)
- Unified handling of POST requests and Websocket requests by putting a
  payload into `conn->content`, `conn->content_len` attributes.
  That simplified user code and eliminated the need of `mg_read()`,
  since mongoose buffers all data prior to calling the callback
- Keep-alive support is the default
- Dropped SSI support and throttling support
- Several configuraition parameters are gone:
  -  `cgi_environment` (replaced with MONGOOSE_CGI),
  -  `protect_uri` (not useful)

  -   `put_delete_auth_file` (renamed to dav_auth_file)
  -   `authentication_domain` (renamed to auth_domain)
- Due to the async, non-blocking nature of the core, few restrictions

    the presence of non-ASCII chars in document root, CGI script name,
    or directory name might have broken Mongoose as stand-alone
    or as Windows service. Now Mongoose works with non-ASCII paths properly.
    Internally, Mongoose uses UTF8 encoding. When making WinAPI calls,
    mongoose converts UTF8 strings to wide chars and calls UNICODE API.
- Enhanced authorization API by providing `mg_set_auth_handler()` and
    `mg_authorize_digest()`
- Removed `mg_add_uri_handler()`, added `mg_set_request_handler()`.
    There is only oneURI handler that handles all requests, just like in 4.x.
    The reason for this change is to provide an ability to catch all URIs,
    and at the same time signal Mongoose to continue handling specific URIs.
- Added `mg_parse_multipart()` API for file uploads.
    Note that the restriction on uploading huge files still exists,
    and will be eliminated in the next release.
- Allowing mongoose to bind to port 0, in which case it'll bind to any
    random unused port.
- Moved `idle_timeout_ms` run-time option to compile-time flag
- Added asynchronous HTTP client, not documented yet. Documentation and
    examples are coming in the next couple of weeks. Async Websocket client
    is scheduled for the next release. See usage examples at `unit_test.c`

1842500,2015-09-21T14:29:28Z,2015-09-21T10:01:40Z,Mongoose 6.0,"# Overview

This is a major release of Mongoose. It brings new capabilities, making Mongoose a multi-protocol network library rather then only HTTP/Websocket. That means more flexible and rich API. New Mongoose API is not backward-compatible with pre-6.0 versions.

# What's New
- Support for plain TCP, plain UDP
- Support for Websocket client 
- JSON-RPC client, JSON-RPC server
- MQTT client, MQTT broker
- CoAP client, CoAP server
- DNS client, DNS server, async DNS resolver
- SSL layer improvements, including modern cryptography support
- New API

# Architecture notes

Pre-6.0 Mongoose was hiding the implementation from the user. Like, internal connection structures, sockets, etc. Mongoose 6.0 opens everything to the user. This has it's pro and cons. The decision to open the guts of the library is to provide power users to take full control over the IO engine. Basic use cases are well covered by the example that are provided in abundance.

# Mongoose Editions

Mongoose is available in three editions to suit your integration needs: 
- Mongoose Lite:        Cross platform integration, SSL/TLS, HTTP support 
- Mongoose:         Mongoose Lite + HTTP CGI, HTTP SSI, HTTP Digest Auth, WebSocket support 
- Mongoose Premium: Mongoose + Plain TCP, UDP, JSON-RPC, MQTT, DNS, CoAP support
