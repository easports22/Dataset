7495846,2017-09-10T17:31:25Z,2017-09-10T17:31:51Z,Version 2.7.0,"**Version 2.7** brings better stability, and powerful new features to Chart.js. The bubble chart options are now completely [scriptable](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.7.0/general/options.html#scriptable-options). This means that you can pass a function to a bubble chart dataset property and have the function be called as needed. This simplifies array properties, and allows quick and easy rendering changes based on data values. Check out the [sample](http://www.chartjs.org/samples/2.7.0/scriptable/bubble.html) for details. If these options prove useful, they can be extended to other chart types in the future.

Building off the time scale rewrite in version 2.6, the time scale now supports options for configuring how [labels generate ticks](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.7.0/axes/cartesian/time.html#ticks-source), how [interpolation between the points is handled](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.7.0/axes/cartesian/time.html#scale-distribution) and the [scale boundary strategy](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.7.0/axes/cartesian/time.html#scale-bounds). Users can now configure ticks to be generated for each label, or be determined automatically from the data limits. Users can also change how ticks are distributed along the axis] to make non-linear time axes. Check out the [sample](http://www.chartjs.org/samples/2.7.0/scales/time/financial.html) for details.

It's now possible to create [advanced area chart](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.6.0/charts/area.html) thanks to a new `filler` plugin: stacked area charts can now fill to another dataset in a configurable manner. Check out the [samples](http://www.chartjs.org/samples/2.6.0/) to see the all the new options.

The time scale internals have been rewritten, improving performance by reducing the number of operations on each tick value. These changes also fixed a number of time scale related issues that users have been experiencing.

Our new documentation has been rewritten using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) and reorganized into smaller topics to improve clarity and allow topics to be more intuitively found.

5400579,2017-02-08T20:25:55Z,2017-02-08T20:26:15Z,Version 2.5.0,"**Version 2.5** brings some exciting new features to Chart.js. Now, configuration options can be updated at runtime (with some exceptions) just by changing the `chart.config.options` object and calling `chart.update()`.  

[More powerful plugins](https://chartjs.gitbooks.io/proposals/content/Plugins.html) that can be added to an individual chart (instead of globally), but also [disabled on a per chart basis](https://chartjs.gitbooks.io/proposals/content/Plugins.html#disable-plugins). This gives you fine grained control over when plugins interact with your charts. The plugins were changed to support cancelling actions by returning `false` from any `before*` plugin calls.

Two new extensions have been added: `beforeEvent` and `afterEvent`, respectively called before and after the chart responds to an input event such as a `mousemove` or a `click`. The plugin is passed a wrapped version of the event, that implements [`IEvent`](https://chartjs.gitbooks.io/proposals/content/Platform.html#event-management).

## Breaking Changes
- #3570 Removed unused `Chart.helpers.cancelAnimFrame` method. 
- #3669 `onHover` callback now has 3 parameters. The 2nd parameter is the event that triggered the hover. This was done for consistency with the `onClick` callback.

## Deprecations
- #3819 `IPlugin.afterScaleUpdate`: use `IPlugin.afterLayout` hook instead.
- #3819 Extending `Chart.PlugingBase` is not anymore required and is strongly discouraged, instead create/register plugins using plain JavaScript objects (see this [example](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/7205ff5e2aa4515bae0c62bb9d8355745837270e/src/core/core.legend.js#L505)).

4517834,2016-11-12T17:57:35Z,2016-11-12T17:58:30Z,Version 2.4.0,"This version focuses on improving the interactivity of Chart.js. We have new and improved modes for interacting with the graph. For instance, you can now highlight the nearest item easily. It is also easy to define your own tooltip modes with a few simple functions. See all the new modes in the [docs](/docs/01-Chart-Configuration.md#interaction-modes). Data animations when adding and removing data have been improved: points now animate in cleanly by default.

## Breaking Changes
- #3356 The default aspect ratio is now correctly applied, meaning that polar, doughnut and radar charts are now rendered with an aspect ratio of 1 (square). The old behavior can be obtained by globally changing the default `aspectRatio` for each chart type (e.g. `Chart.defaults.doughnut.aspectRatio = 2`).

Starting with v2.2.0-rc.1 Chart.js uses a new build system. We no longer include the checked in files (dist folder) in the repository. When a tagged release is made, a build will occur and will be published on NPM automatically. A huge thanks to @simonbrunel for getting this set up and working. 

This change means that installing via bower needs to use the [bower npm resolver](https://github.com/mjeanroy/bower-npm-resolver). Detailed instructions can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/docs/00-Getting-Started.md#bower)

* Plugins can now return `false` to cancel actions. Currently only the `beforeDatasetsUpdate` plugin call supports this.
* Added a config callback `onResize` that runs when the chart resizes.
* The on canvas legend can now be placed on the left or the right. Simply add `position: 'right'` to the legend config to make this happen. The [Horizontal Bar sample](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/samples/bar-horizontal.html) includes this.

Improved support for Asynchronous Module Definition and Common JS was added. Documentation for version 2 is available at http://nnnick.github.io/Chart.js/docs-v2/

## Breaking API Changes

`scale.ticks.minRotation` was removed as it was not used.

## Features

### Legend and Title Block

Chart titles can now be added. An on canvas legend is enabled by default. Clicking or tapping on an item in the legend will toggle the visibility of the appropriate item in the chart.

### UMD Build

Added a build step to add UMD headers via [gulp-umd](https://github.com/eduardolundgren/gulp-umd). These headers support AMD loaders such as requireJS, CommonJS modules, and falling back to the global context.

_Beta is as close as we've been to a stable release of some of the coolest new features Chart.js has seen in years._

**New Features since v2.0.0-alpha4:**
- New Bubble chart and controller
- Tooltip callbacks. Instead of a confusing templating language, we found a simpler approach to easily layout and customize your tooltips.  Every tooltip callback (beforeTitle, title, afterTitle, etc..) accepts a string or an array.  If an array is used, it will produce multiple lines.  Tooltips now come with a lot more options for visual customization as well.
- Datasets can now be hidden by simply setting a `hidden: true` property and calling `chart.update()`
- You can now use separate hover and tooltip modes (eg. showing a tooltip for an entire label, but have one point from that label be clickable and accept visual changes).
- Travis CI now runs unit-tests.  So yes, all new PR's must pass unit-tests to be merged! Yay!
- Time Scale now supports `to` and `from` time properties to limit the min and max of the scale shown.
- All scales now support scatter-style data eg. `data: [{x: Date(), y: 10} , {x: Date(), y: 15}]` in which case the `labels` array is optional.
- Scale label rotation is now smarter.
- Charts now accurately handle `null, undefined, or NaN` values in a predicable way (they don't get displayed and your chart won't die ;)
- Controllers 
- Bug fixes and stability improvements

- A new core scale class and a hook-able scale lifecycle provides a base for our built in scales, and make it 100x easier to build your own scales.
- Scales are no longer responsible for element-specific functionality, and simply extend the base scale class.  This makes some of them only a couple of lines long!
- Time Scale! Just include moment.js before Chart.js and gain access to the very powerful time scale.  It's automagic right out of the box, works with any time/date format (Date, String, Moment), and comes with powerful options for customization.
- Better support for Log scale and mixing scale types.
- Scale labels are now built-in
- Responsive module has been completely redesigned to handle any use case.  Dimensions are reliable, won't change on their own, and yes, you can finally hide your charts in tabs, popups, or anything that was previously barred by the now debunked display:none issue.
- Adding/removing and changing data is now simple as push, pop, shift.  No need to use a fussy api, just alter the data in your config, and hit update.  Magic!
- Reduced 2.0 build size to 122kb (minified)
- Updated Documentation for Getting Started and Scales
- ~ 56% Unit Test Coverage

- [x] **Core Controller** - Every chart is now intelligently controlled by `core.controller`. By eliminating chart type constructors, and standardizing the chart api, this controller allows for new and powerful ways of extending chart.js!
- [x] **Dataset Style Controllers** - Every dataset is and can be controlled by separate controllers. So yes, hybrid charts are possible now.  And writing extensions is easier than ever.  Need a new dataset style? Write a new controller! Need a new type of element? Write it!
- [x] **Config Driven Charts** - You can now change pretty much anything in the chart config, call `.update()` and your chart will change!  This opens up new possibilities for theme building!
- [x] **Improved Events** - New event hooks like onHover and onClick do the hard work for you.  They pass you the good stuff without even having to locate via event.
- [x] **Improved Responsiveness** - Smoother, faster, and even animated (if you prefer it that way)! 
- [x] **Nested Pie Charts**
- [x] **Radar Chart Bezier Lines**
- [x] **Better Scales**

Building off of v1.1's animation refactor, chart scales have been completely rewritten by @etimberg.  @tannerlinsley has added many needed enhancements to existing chart types, and chart configurations are now more powerful than ever.
- Animate all things!  (Almost everything is animatable now, including color changes).
- You have more control over axis declarations and even have multiple axes on a single chart. For details, including screenshots, please see https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/pull/1132
- 10-100x speed improvements - by batching animation frames and eliminating extraneous data copies, everything runs faster, smoother and with less CPU
- New core chart type - scatter plot that allows arbitrary placement of data points.
- Chart configs, options, and data are now bound to the chart.  No more traversing the chart object to update anything.  Just update the options you originally passed to your new Chart and call `.update()` on your chart instance!
- Easier API and access to custom overrides.  metaData and metaDataset properties now house all of the Chart.js goodness and a simple custom property can override any color, border, etc. with ease.  Just call `.update()`!
- Plenty more that won't fit here.  Feedback is greatly appreciated and PR's welcomed.  Thanks!
