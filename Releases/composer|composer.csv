- Break: The `update` command now has --dev enabled by default. --no-dev can be used to update without dev requirements, but it will create an incomplete lock file and is discouraged
- Break: Removed support for lock files created before 2012-09-15 due to their outdated unusable format

- Added `preferred-install` config option to always enable --prefer-source or --prefer-dist

- Added wildcard support in the update whitelist, e.g. to update all packages of a vendor do `composer update vendor/*`
- Added `archive` command to archive the current directory or a given package
- Added `run-script` command to manually trigger scripts
- Added `proprietary` as valid license identifier for non-free code

- Added a `lib-ICU` platform package
- Added a new official package type `project` for project-bootstrapping packages
- Added zip/dist local cache to speed up repetitive installations
- Added `post-autoload-dump` script event
- Added `Event::getDevMode` to let script handlers know if dev requirements are being installed
- Added `discard-changes` config option to control the default behavior when updating ""dirty"" dependencies
- Added `use-include-path` config option to make the autoloader look for files in the include path too

- Added support for svn repositories containing packages in a deeper path (see package-path option)
- Added an `artifact` repository to scan a directory containing zipped packages

- Added --no-progress to `install` and `update` to hide the progress indicators
- Added --available (-a) flag to the `show` command to display only available packages

- Added --optimize-autoloader (-o) flag to optimize the autoloader from the `install` and `update` commands
- Added -vv and -vvv flags to get more verbose output, can be useful to debug some issues
