* No longer listen for netlink messages. This improves flannel performance at high scale (especially on heavily loaded systems) and minimizes the possibility for dropped traffic when the flannel deamon is stopped (e.g. during upgrades).
* Fully compatible with previous versions of flannel to allow for easy upgrade
* Adds support for new ""direct routing"" mode where packets are only VXLAN encapsulated if there isn't a directly connected route to the destination host.

It also adds a retry mechanism to the `--ip-masq` feature to ensure that `iptables` rules are correct.

There are a number of other important bug fixes and improvements. See the complete list below.

- aws-vpc backend: now supports role based auth in addition to env vars. Thank you, Greg Poirier.
- fixed problem of flannel failing to work with interfaces that have peer addresses defined.
- turn on etcd client logging. This will produce a lot of output but better than no output as it now.

- Switched over to using master branch of go-etcd

943904,2015-02-12T01:02:09Z,2015-02-12T01:51:42Z,Better IP Masq support and host-gw backend added,"1. --ip-masq now works for all backends. Previously it was only
   working properly for UDP backend.
2. Addition of new ""host-gw"" backend -- thank you, Angus Lees. This
   new backend avoids encapsulation and uses the host's interface as a
   gateway. As a subnet is added or removed, each flannel daemon will
   manipulate the host's routing table to reflect the change. As an
   example, if a host that has an IP 192.168.1.5 adds a flannel subnet
   10.1.8.0/24, the following route would be added to each host:
   10.1.8.0/24 via 192.168.1.5 dev eth0
