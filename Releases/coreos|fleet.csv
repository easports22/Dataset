- #786: fleet now supports global units
- #794: the API now serves its discovery document
- #814: the API now supports query parameters when retrieving units

## Changes
- #621: the `X-` and `X-Condition` prefixes of certain unit options are now deprecated and should be removed from unit files
- #802: fleet no longer depends on glog and instead uses its own simplified log package
- #807: the `fleet` binary is now called `fleetd`. Users may need to adjust their init scripts appropriately.
- #809: the documentation was significantly reworked, with many examples updated and similar documents combined
- #810: resource reservation options are no longer parsed in unit files. These were never actually considered by fleet, so this is a no-op
- #868: the `TMACHINE` field in `fleetctl` output has been renamed to `TARGET`. The old name will still function but is deprecated; users should migrate to TARGET

## Bugs Fixed
- #793: units with invalid names no longer cause issues with state publishing
- #855: the schema ID for unit delete operations in the API is fixed
- #861: when detecting the local IP address, fleetd only considers global unicast addresses
- #862: the API returns clearer errors when invalid units are submitted

This caused a lot of unnecessary stress on etcd and was not able to quickly schedule units into the cluster. This mechanism was replaced with a monolithic scheduler running in a single engine. Each engine master-elects this responsibility to provide quick failover in the event of a single machine going down.

We made a great amount of progress on fleet’s HTTP API. Its current resource layout will likely be what is released as the official API.

The relationship between unit state and the underlying fleet agents has been modified to allow multiple agents to report state under the same unit name. This change not only helps communicate what is actually happening in the cluster at any given time, but paves the way for global units (https://github.com/coreos/fleet/issues/681). This did have some consequences for fleetctl - the `state` and `dstate` fields moved from `list-units` to `list-unit-files`.

Unit signing has been removed. The related flags and commands no longer function.

### Upgrade Notes

While fleet is still under heavy development it is not reasonable to expect a seamless rolling upgrade of a fleet cluster. Do not expect a cluster to be usable with mixed versions of fleet, and do not expect old versions of fleetctl to work after the cluster has been upgraded.

An upgrade from v0.2 to v0.3 will not result in the loss of existing units, but any units that were active pre-upgrade may need to be be restarted post-upgrade. Using the new fleetctl binary, you can run `fleetctl start --no-block` on your units before beginning the upgrade to automatically transition them to a `launched` state once the upgrade is complete.
