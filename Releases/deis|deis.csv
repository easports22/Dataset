It is a Long Term Support (LTS) release, which means we will continue to patch bugs and accept pull requests, however any new features should be applied to [Deis Workflow](https://deis.com/), the successor to Deis.

Deis v1.13.0 bumps CoreOS to 899.13.0, updates the system's containers to Alpine 3.3, removes the scheduler technology previews, bumps the Heroku buildpacks to the latest stable versions, adds a healthcheck url `/healthz` to the controller, and allows logspout to re-discover the logger when it jumps to another control plane node.

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, please read the [""Upgrading Deis""](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## v1.13.0 Summary

### New Features
- **deis-client** responds to `deis version`, `deis -v`, `deis --version` and `deis help version`
- **deis-controller** now has a health check view at `/healthz`
- There are graceful shutdown scripts for Ceph and Ceph-less nodes. See more [here](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/add_remove_host/)
- **deis-controller** returns a 409 when cancelling a user account that has applications

### Improvements
- **deis-router** now makes `vhost_traffic_status_zone` configurable
- **deis-logspout** now continuously re-discovers the logger's connection information, should it be re-scheduled onto another host
- **deis-controller** prevents overlapping `config:set` operations
- **deis-client** only deletes `~/.deis/client.json` if you're cancelling your own account
- **deis-controller** fixed a bug where single quotes could not be used in an environment variable
- **deis-builder** can be used from within a proxied environment
- **deis-database** exits if it is unable to check for existing backups in Ceph
- Linode's provisioning script now allows for cluster expansion

### Under the Hood
- **deis-controller** removed all the scheduler technology previews, including Kubernetes, Swarm and Mesos
  - If you want to test Deis on Kubernetes, please try out the [Deis Workflow Beta](https://github.com/deis/controller/)!
- CoreOS was updated to [899.13.0](https://coreos.com/releases/#899.13.0)
- **deis-controller** bumped docker-py to [1.7.2](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/blob/master/docs/change_log.md#172)
- Most components upgraded their Docker base image to [Alpine 3.3](http://www.alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.3.0-released.html)
- All Heroku buildpacks were updated to their current release versions

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

**NOTE:** Docker Hub will disable access for `docker` versions 1.5 and earlier [on December 7, 2015](http://blog.docker.com/2015/10/docker-hub-deprecation-1-5/). Releases of Deis prior to v1.12.0 relied on `docker` 1.5.0 and will experience problems after that date. As a result, all users are encouraged to provision a new v1.12.0 cluster which does not rely on a specific `docker` version.

Join the fun: new contributors to Deis can get [free DigitalOcean credits](http://deis.io/code-for-credit-digitalocean/)!

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, please read the [""Upgrading Deis""](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.12.0 Summary

### New Features
- **deis-controller** uses the host's Docker engine for app config, no longer requiring Docker 1.5.0
- `deis pull` now works with images built by Docker 1.6.2 and later
- `deisctl list-machines` shows details of the nodes in your cluster
- **deis-logger** has new drains that are more performant and resilient
- **deis-builder** makes `$SOURCE_VERSION` available to buildpacks for Heroku compatibility
- **deis-controller** disables swap usage when a memory limit is set
- **deis-registry** logs more information during its startup process

### Improvements

### Under the Hood
- **deis-builder** uses Docker 1.8.3 internally for future compatibility
- Deis CI systems use Docker 1.8.3 for building and testing
- Heroku-compatible buildpacks were updated to current release versions
- `deisctl` revised its `fleet` API code to v0.10.2

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.11.0 Summary

### New Features
- **deis-logger** is [rewritten](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/4502) for stability and extensibility
- [**deis-registry**](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/registry_settings/#settings-used-by-registry) allows IAM role authentication for S3
- `deis apps:transfer` lets a user hand off ownership of an app to another user
- **deis-builder** checks out submodules in custom buildpacks as needed
- **deis-router** on AWS has improved [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)-aware ELB healthchecks
- **deis-router** can enforce [whitelisting of IP addresses](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/security_considerations/#ip-whitelist) for apps or for **deis-controller**
- New AWS clusters prevent CloudFormation from replacing instances on AMI changes
- `$DEISCTL_TUNNEL` is automatically discovered on vagrant provisioning
- **deis-controller** can write app event logs via logspout

### Improvements
- Scripts in contrib/ support [`rigger`](https://github.com/deis/rigger), the new deployment tool for Deis
- **deis-controller** healthchecks properly ignore non-web processes
- Graceful upgrades fixed several issues found in the wild
- Documentation is more detailed about Azure provisioning and when `deisctl` is needed
- Docs have an architecture diagram and detail about the [**deis-router** mesh](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/understanding_deis/architecture/#router-mesh)
- Docs give an example of backing **deis-registry** with OpenStack [Swift](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/running-deis-without-ceph/#configure-registry)
- `deis config:set` handles multi-line environment variables
- The `deis` client suggests help if `deis create` fails on the git remote
- `deis` correctly displays unexpected non-JSON error messages and malformed logs
- `deis` prints all error messages to stderr
- The `route53-wildcard` contrib script handles its `--zone` argument correctly
- `deis register` returns a better error if registration is disabled
- `deisctl status` is listed in the main help message
- **deis-controller** more thoroughly validates config keys
- contrib/ firewall scripts check that `etcd` is running

### Under the Hood
- [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) is updated to 766.4.0, the current stable channel version
- New clusters use CoreOS' default [`etcd2`](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) and [`flannel`](https://github.com/coreos/flannel) services
- Azure provisioning uses new [ARM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/#) templates
- DigitalOcean provisioning uses [terraform](https://terraform.io/)
- The optional **deis-cache** component is removed, but **deis-registry** still uses it if it is present in an upgraded cluster
- The `shellcheck` script linter tool was updated to 0.4.1

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's Next

### Docker v2 Registry

The Deis registry must be [upgraded to the new v2 API](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/3814) to ensure forward-compatibility with Docker.  This has a number of added benefits including performance and trust. Great progress has been made in detaching **deis-controller** from depending on a specific Docker version and in reimplementing `deis pull` to work with any standard registry container. Work remains to migrate existing v1 registry data to v2.

### Rigger

[Rigger](https://github.com/deis/rigger) is a new tool designed to make it easier to provision and test Deis clusters.  With `rigger`, you can stand up and test a Deis cluster on any provider with just a handful of simple commands.  The Deis core team is already using `rigger` internally, but we are looking for feedback.  Please provide your thoughts and requirements on the [design document](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/4345).

- `deis` respects the `--limit=` flag for commands which list results
- Automated provision and upgrade acceptance tests now live under `tests/bin/accept`

### Improvements
- Various fixes to AWS, Azure, bare metal, Linode, and OpenStack provisioning
- Optional swarm scheduler components aren't built by default now; use `make -C swarm/ build`
- NewRelic contrib docs updated now that container CPU and memory usage are available
- **deis-logger** logs a unique id for each app name, helping Kubernetes scheduler usage
- **deis-logger** now allows underscores in container names
- **deis-logspout** fixes a potential deadlock when attaching to containers
- Integration tests fail if `deis` prints any warning
- Collaborators on apps can no longer manage others' permissions without being admins
- Users can revoke their own app access, and some permissions checks were fixed
- `deisctl install` and similar commands group k8s, mesos, and swarm components logically
- `deisctl dock` and `deisctl ssh` show help and handle arguments more consistently

### Under the Hood
- All components and clients are built with Go 1.5, which speeds garbage collection and enables concurrent execution
- nginx is updated to 1.9.4
- deis-store components are updated to [Ceph 0.94.3](http://ceph.com/docs/hammer/release-notes/)

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's Next

### Docker Engine Upgrade

Due to critical bugs in recent Docker engines related to parallel layer pulls and v1/v2 registry compatibility, we've been forced to pin Deis clusters to Docker 1.5.0.  We now believe these issues have been resolved and are eager to move to the newer version of Docker that ships with the latest CoreOS stable release.

### Docker v2 Registry

The Deis registry must be [upgraded to the new v2 API](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/3814) to ensure forward-compatibility with Docker.  This has a number of added benefits including performance and trust.  However, this will be a tricky migration given the v1 registry data we currently store, as well as the `deis pull` hooks in our fork of the Docker registry.

### Rigger

[Rigger](https://github.com/deis/rigger) is a new tool designed to make it easier to provision and test Deis clusters.  With `rigger`, you can stand up and test a Deis cluster on any provider with just a handful of simple commands.  The Deis core team is already using `rigger` internally, but we are looking for feedback.  Please provide your thoughts and requirements on the [design document](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/4345).

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, please read the [""Upgrading Deis""](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.9.0 Summary

### New Features
- [Kubernetes scheduler](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#k8s-scheduler) tech preview!
- [Mesos with Marathon scheduler](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#mesos-scheduler) tech preview!
- `deis config:set HEALTHCHECK_URL=/` enables liveness and readiness app [health checks](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/using_deis/config-application/#custom-health-checks)
- Tools for a [graceful upgrade](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/#graceful-upgrade) to future versions of Deis are in place
- `deisctl dock` opens a shell or runs commands on a running container
- `deisctl ssh` can also run commands directly on a node
- `deisctl install` can specify the router mesh size (default is 3)
- A faster, more portable `deis` CLI written [in Go](https://github.com/deis/deis/tree/master/client-go) is ready for your testing and feedback!
- `make commit-hook` installs a helper to warn about git [commit style](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/contributing/standards/#commit-style)

### Improvements
- `deisctl` exits with an error if `stop` or `start` fails
- deis-controller enforces correct types for CPU, mem, and tags config
- deis-controller allows non-superusers to manage their keys
- deis-controller ignores setting gunicorn workers < 1
- deis-database backs up the DB on unit stop
- deis-logger uses only one `Ticker` for time-related operations
- deis-publisher displays the HTTP error on connection failure
- deis-router builds the set-misc module for nginx `set_random`
- Makefiles install go tools from golang.org, not code.google.com

### Under the Hood
- Shell scripts throughout the project are validated with [shellcheck](http://www.shellcheck.net/)
- The [`flannel`](https://github.com/coreos/flannel) overlay network is active on newly provisioned clusters
- [`etcd`](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/tag/v2.1.1) v2.1.1 runs in a container on newly provisioned clusters
- Updated vendored [`fleet`](https://github.com/coreos/fleet/) code for `deisctl` to 0.9.2
- Updated vendored [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) code for tests to 1.5.0
- deis-router verifies the downloaded [nginx](http://nginx.org/) archive

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's Next

### Builder in Go

The deis-builder component consists of a variety of shell scripts and binary tools which has proved difficult to maintain over time. Rewriting the builder as a set of Go packages will make it easier to test, improve, and extend this core component.

This work is nearly completed. See [PR 4010](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/4010) for more detail.

### Deis CLI in Go

The `deis` CLI is a one-file python app that has served the project well, but its PyInstaller-based binary packaging is inefficient, and it sometimes runs into incompatibilities with specific platforms. Rewriting the `deis` CLI as a Go binary has already proved to be faster and more portable.

This work is nearly completed. See [PR 4015](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/4015) for more detail.

### TTY Broker

Today Deis cannot provide bi-directional streams needed for log tailing and interactive batch processes. By having the Controller drive a TTY Broker component, Deis can securely open WebSockets through the routing mesh.

See [TTY Broker](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/#tty-broker) at the [Deis Roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) for more detail.

### Teams / Fine-Grained Permissions

Deis uses a simple permissions model currently, involving only two roles: admin and user. Features such as sharing applications, modifying certs, and changing config could be implemented with more specific permissions.

Work is underway on gathering community feedback and implementing teams and more refined permissions. See [issue 4150](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/4150) and [issue 4173](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/4173) for details.

## Community Shout-Outs

The Deis project would like to extend our profound gratitude to 2015 interns Joshua Anderson (@Joshua-Anderson) and Keerthan Mala (@kmala). Joshua attacked the controller, client, and project infrastructure and made myriad improvements while rewriting our world in Go. Keerthan applied his domain expertise and owned Kubernetes (k8s), giving Deis a scheduler for the future. We have all enjoyed working with Joshua and Keerthan more than we can say, and the Deis project is much richer because of them. Thank you!

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.8.0 Summary

### New Features

- deis-router uses new nginx `reuseport` [socket sharding](https://www.nginx.com/blog/socket-sharding-nginx-release-1-9-1/)
- Deis can be provisioned [on Linode](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/installing_deis/linode/), thanks to community support!
- `deisctl ssh <component>` opens a shell directly to the node running the specified Deis component
- deis-router features security configuration for [DHE ciphersuites](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/3872), [SSL ciphers](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/3873), and [HSTS](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/3866)
- `deis auth:regenerate` creates a new authentication token
- deis-controller will properly roll back a release if some containers weren't created

### Improvements
- Source code for `deisctl` is substantially refactored, with beefier, parallelized test coverage
- Numerous enhancements to API reference documentation and generated code docs
- Fixed ""invalid tar magic"" error when pushing without a Procfile
- Fixed JSON decoding errors in test suite due to premature SSH close
- deis-builder generates SSH keys on boot when needed
- Doc updates to upgrade procedure, EC2 PROXY protocol, and cluster sizing for etcd
- Contrib README.md mentions new community tools for monitoring and backup/restore
- Added Engine Yard provisioning and Deis Pro to docs
- `deisctl` won't hang forever waiting for a missing service
- deis-builder only builds slugrunner/slugbuilder if they're missing
- Amazon EC2 m4 instance types are now supported in provisioning
- DigitalOcean support added a couple of eligible regions
- `DEIS_DRINK_OF_CHOICE=slurm` won't break integration tests now
- deis-registry will SIGHUP its processes correctly on restart
- deis-builder won't log `etcdctl watch` output periodically
- integration tests will retry `docker push` on Docker Hub errors

### Under the Hood
- deis-router updated nginx to [1.9.2](http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES)
- deis-registry incorporates some upstream fixes to the ""classic"" V1 registry
- deis-database updated wal-e to 0.8.1

- Several components updated to confd 0.10.0

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's Next

### Configurable Healthchecks

To enable publishing of new app releases with zero downtime, Deis needs a more strict, configurable HTTP healthcheck facility. Substantial progress has been made, but more coding and testing remains. Look forward to true zero-downtime deploys in the next release!

### TTY Broker

Today Deis cannot provide bi-directional streams needed for log tailing and interactive batch processes. By having the Controller drive a TTY Broker component, Deis can securely open WebSockets through the routing mesh.

See [TTY Broker](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/#tty-broker) at the [Deis Roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) for more detail.

### Scheduling and Orchestration

Today Deis uses Fleet for scheduling. Unfortunately, Fleet does not support resource-based scheduling, which results in poor cluster utilization at scale.

Fortunately, Deis is composable and can easily hot-swap orchestration APIs. Because the most promising container orchestration solutions are under heavy development, the Deis project is focused on releasing ""technology previews"".

These technology previews will help the community try different orchestration solutions easily, report their findings and help guide the future direction of Deis.

See [Scheduling and Orchestration](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/#scheduling-and-orchestration) at the [Deis Roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) for more detail.

### Etcd 2

A CP database like `etcd` is central to Deis, which requires a distributed lock service and key/value store. As problems with etcd directly impact platform stability, Deis must move to the more stable etcd2.

See [Etcd 2](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/#etcd-2) at the [Deis Roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) for more detail.

The Deis project is excited to announce [v1.7.0](https://github.com/deis/deis/releases/tag/v1.7.0), featuring automatic host removal, smaller Docker images, and fixes for platform hardening. The leading open source PaaS is now yours to steer: read the Deis [Open Roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) and participate in [release planning](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/planning/#release-planning-meetings)!

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, please read the [""Upgrading Deis""](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.7.0 Summary

### New Features
- Deis has adopted an [Open Roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) and planning process
- Most components use [`alpine:3.1`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) as a base, making Docker images smaller
- Optional scripts allow for [automatic host removal](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/add_remove_host/#automatic-host-removal)
- All Heroku-compatible buildpacks were updated to recent versions
- Deis [example apps](https://github.com/deis?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=example-) have been updated to current languages and frameworks
- Randomly-generated app names won't collide with existing ones, and the vocabulary is expanded
- `deisctl config rm` removes an existing deis configuration key
- deis-controller can be customized to appear [at a subdomain](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/controller_settings/#settings-used-by-controller) other than `deis.`
- `deis auth:passwd` accepts a `--username` flag to allow an admin to update a user's password
- deis-publisher can be profiled with Go's `pprof` package
- EC2 provisioning supports custom volume sizes
- deis-publisher exposes its config as flags
- deis-controller doesn't use deprecated HTTP X- headers
- Azure clusters automatically create a new discovery URL during provisioning

### Improvements
- deis-builder removes the `git` repo and related Docker images after `deis destroy`
- deis-router won't keep hashing on an empty string
- some `etcd` errors which were hidden are now properly raised at component start
- `deis logs -n` won't raise an IOError when piped to `head`
- `deis builds:create` requires an explicit Docker image tag
- EC2 clusters use an EBS volume to store `etcd` data
- docker.service now depends on its mount to exist before starting
- better documentation for Deis [backup/restore](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/backing_up_data/) and for [CoreOS upgrades](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/#upgrading-coreos)
- `deisctl list` no longer lists an app named `deis-demo`, for example
- [deis-swarm](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#swarm-scheduler) unit files are now fetched with `deisctl refresh-units`
- [`deis config:push` and `config:pull`](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/using_deis/config-application/#configure-the-application) validate the `.env` file syntax

### Under the Hood
- updated CoreOS to [647.2.0]()
- `deis` honors requests' environment variables such as `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`
- Ceph uses a lower, more appropriate number of placement groups
- deis-logger won't query `etcd` for every log line
- deis-database runs backups in the background
- deis-builder was reorganized around Docker image best practices
- deis-controller's [`webEnabled` key](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/controller_settings/#settings-used-by-controller) uses a safer numeric default of `0`
- custom clock sync logic in `user-data` was unneeded and was removed
- `$PORT` logic was unused and removed from fleet
- deis-builder silenced some benign `pipefail` errors on boot
- deis-router returns a 404 for a non-existent app

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's Next

### Pluggable Storage Subsystem

Deis uses Ceph to provide a highly-available storage subsystem for stateful control plane components. While Ceph is the right default storage subsystem, it is tricky to operate and can result in control plane instability. Ceph should be optional, especially for users on AWS with direct access to services like S3.

See [Pluggable Storage Subsystem](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/#pluggable-storage-subsystem) at the [Deis Roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) for more detail.

### TTY Broker

Today Deis cannot provide bi-directional streams needed for log tailing and interactive batch processes. By having the :ref:`Controller` drive a TTY Broker component, Deis can securely open WebSockets through the routing mesh.

See [TTY Broker](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/#tty-broker) at the [Deis Roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) for more detail.

### Scheduling and Orchestration

Today Deis uses Fleet for scheduling. Unfortunately, Fleet does not support resource-based scheduling, which results in poor cluster utilization at scale.

Fortunately, Deis is composable and can easily hot-swap orchestration APIs. Because the most promising container orchestration solutions are under heavy development, the Deis project is focused on releasing ""technology previews"".

These technology previews will help the community try different orchestration solutions easily, report their findings and help guide the future direction of Deis.

See [Scheduling and Orchestration](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/#scheduling-and-orchestration) at the [Deis Roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) for more detail.

Deis is now supported by [Engine Yard](http://deis.io/deis-meet-engine-yard/)!

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, please read the [""Upgrading Deis""](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.6.0 Summary

### New Features
- Docker [Swarm](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#swarm-scheduler) is available for preview as an alternative to [Fleet](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#fleet-scheduler) for scheduling application units
- EC2 provisioning supports the [Proxy Protocol](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/enable-proxy-protocol.html), allowing WebSocket support for apps through an Elastic Load Balancer
- SSL certificates in SAN format are now supported
- `deis users:list` allows an admin to see all registered Deis users
- `deis ps:restart` stops and starts all containers, all those of a process type,
  or a single container
- `deis config:push` allows a `--path` argument to the `.env` file
- `deis logs` accepts `-n` to limit the number of lines displayed
- user registration can be `enabled`, `disabled`, or set to `adminOnly`
- logging level in router can be customized
- the number of worker processes in controller can be scaled

### Improvements
- `deis register` checks for a valid controller URL before continuing
- logger exposes its config as feature flags, and is more extensible
- Azure provisioning creates a load-balanced HTTPS endpoint
- EC2 provisioning shows a countdown timer and reports any CloudFormation errors
- `git push` errors are handled and reported more reliably
- `deis keys:add` uses SSH fingerprints to determine uniqueness
- registry determines S3 bucket name dynamically from `etcd`
- moved route53-wildcard.py script to contrib/ec2 to help with DNS setup
- `make -C controller/ postgres` creates a DB container for running unit tests

### Under the Hood
- bumped CoreOS to 633.1.0
- updated Ceph to ""Hammer"" release
- bumped `confd` to v0.9.0 in all components
- builder now uses the official `heroku/cedar:14` image
- router updated to nginx 1.9 for stream module TCP support
- added new C4 instance types to EC2 provisioning
- added sfo1 and ams2 data centers to DigitalOcean provisioning

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's Next

### New Container Schedulers

Application containers require a resource-aware scheduler to improve cluster efficiency at scale and to alleviate issues with [cluster balancing after the loss of a node](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2920). In addition to the [Swarm](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/3612) technology preview in this release, prototyping is underway with [Kubernetes](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2744) and [Mesos](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/3538).

Deis will default to using [fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet) for both control plane and data plane scheduling for the foreseeable future.

### Improved Test Infrastructure

We need to speed up test suites and increase test coverage to include operational aspects such as upgrades and HA. Hard work behind the scenes and invaluable community support are steadily improving the Deis test infrastructure.

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, please read the [""Upgrading Deis""](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.5.0 Summary

### New Features
- you can now [attach SSL certificates](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/reference/domain-ssl/) to your applications!

- a [platform-wide log drain](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/platform_logging/#application-log-drain) has been added
- [multiple profile support](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/3367) has been added to the client
- LDAP support has been added to the controller
- `xip.io` domains are now allowed with `deis domains:add`

### Improvements
- our test infrastructure now deploys on EC2, providing test functionality to EC2 changes

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's Next

### Improved Test Infrastructure

We need to speed up test suites, eliminate the PR build queue, and increase test coverage to include operational aspects such as upgrades and HA. Hard work behind the scenes and invaluable community support are steadily improving the Deis test infrastructure.

### New Container Scheduler

Application containers require a resource-aware scheduler to improve cluster efficiency at scale and to alleviate issues with [cluster balancing after the loss of a node](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2920). Prototyping is well underway with [Swarm](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/3134) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2744).

Deis will continue to support [fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet) for both control plane and data plane scheduling for the foreseeable future.

### Application SSL Support

Thanks to community discussion and effort, work on application SSL support has begun. What remains is an agreement on [the formal specification](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/2911) following Heroku and an updated implementation. Once merged, users will be able to install custom private keys and SSL certificates to expose HTTPS applications using the Deis router.

### Improved Test Infrastructure

We need to speed up test suites, eliminate the PR build queue, and increase test coverage to include operational aspects such as upgrades and HA. Hard work behind the scenes and invaluable community support are steadily improving the Deis test infrastructure.

### New Container Scheduler

Application containers require a resource-aware scheduler to improve cluster efficiency at scale and to alleviate issues with [cluster balancing after the loss of a node](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2920). Prototyping is well underway with [Swarm](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/3134) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2744).

Deis will continue to support [fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet) for both control plane and data plane scheduling for the foreseeable future.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.3.0 Summary

### New Features
- The optional `deis-store-admin` service helps with Ceph troubleshooting
- [builder](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/builder) disallows simultaneous `git push` on one app
- [builder](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/builder) runs application builds as a non-root user
- [controller](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/controller) REST views are updated and simplified

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's Next

### Application SSL Support

Thanks to community discussion and the efforts of @jparkerCAA in [pull request 2570](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/2570), application SSL support should land in Deis soon. What remains is an agreement on [the formal specification](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/2911) following Heroku and an updated implementation. Once merged, users will be able to install custom private keys and SSL certificates to expose HTTPS applications using the Deis router.

### Improved Test Infrastructure

We are in the process of planning another round of improvements to our test infrastructure.  The goals are to speed our test suites, eliminate the build queue and increase coverage to include operational aspects like upgrades and HA.

### New Container Scheduler

We are evaluating a new, resource-aware scheduler for application containers in the data plane to improve cluster efficiency at scale and to alleviate issues with [cluster balancing after the loss of a node](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2920). Prototyping is ongoing with Mesos, Kubernetes, and Docker Swarm.

Deis will continue to support Fleet for both control plane and data plane scheduling for the foreseeable future.

771796,2014-12-10T16:23:07Z,2014-12-10T16:05:23Z,Deis v1.1 - CoreOS Stable Channel,"The Deis project is fired up to announce [v1.1.0](https://github.com/deis/deis/releases/tag/v1.1.0), the first update in our new [monthly release cycle](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/contributing/schedule/). The CoreOS stable channel is now used to provision Deis.  Process type management has been improved for all Docker, Procfile and Docker-plus-Procfile workflows.

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, read the [""Upgrading Deis""](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.1.0 Summary

### New Features
- Deis now follows CoreOS' [Stable channel](https://coreos.com/releases/) for updates
- Process type management has been significantly improved!
  - See [Process Types and the Procfile](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/using_deis/process-types/) for more information
- `deisctl` respects the `--ssh-timeout` option flag
- Integration test suite uploads more verbose logs to S3 for future reference
- Nginx routers have a NAXSI firewall installed, but disabled by default
  - See [Customizing router](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/router_settings/) to enable the firewall
- `deis` CLI checks against the API version instead of the platform version
- `registry` is now scalable. Try `deisctl scale registry=3` for added redundancy!

### Under the Hood
- [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) updated to v494.4.0
- [wal-e](https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e) updated to [dbf9783](https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e/commits/dbf9783)
- [controller](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/controller) API bumped to v1.1.0
- [controller](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/controller) updated docker-py to v0.6.0
- [builder](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/builder) has begun initial refactoring to a pure Go component
- [registry](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/registry) updated to v0.9.0

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's Next

### Application SSL Support

Thanks to the efforts of @jparkerCAA [per-application SSL support](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/2570) should land in Deis very soon.  Once merged, users will be able to install custom private keys and SSL certificates to expose HTTPS applications using the Deis router.

### Improved Test Infrastructure

We are in the process of planning another round of improvements to our test infrastructure.  The goals are to speed our test suites, eliminate the build queue and increase coverage to include operational aspects like upgrades and HA.

### Mesos Integration

We have an alpha version of Deis + Mesos running.  We are polishing it with help from our friends at [Mesosphere](http://mesosphere.io/) and hope to announce a production-ready version soon.  If you are interested in helping test Deis on Mesos, please find us in IRC!

If you are upgrading to v1.0.2 of Deis, we strongly recommend you first stop Deis with `deisctl stop platform`. [Upgrade CoreOS](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/#upgrading-coreos) to 509.1.0 on each node in the cluster, one at a time. Then add a configuration file on each node at `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/50-insecure-registry.conf`:

``` conf
[Service]
Environment=""DOCKER_OPTS=--insecure-registry 10.0.0.0/8 --insecure-registry 172.16.0.0/12 --insecure-registry 192.168.0.0/16""
```

and restart the docker daemon so that Docker will be able to communicate with **deis-registry**.

## Known Issues

### Docker 1.3.1

Starting in Docker 1.3.1, TLS is now required for all registry communication (public or private).  While we are proponents of this in principle, the way it was rolled out has caused a range of issues for anyone using a private registry -- including Deis.  We are working hard to address this issue, but for now Deis only works with Docker 1.3.0.

### Logs on Upgrade

When upgrading from earlier Deis releases to v1.0+, it is possible to lose platform log data due to upgrading of Ceph components.  We are exploring workarounds, but for now we recommend following our [backup and restore process](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/backing_up_data/) to ensure you do not lose log data on upgrade.  This will not be a problem with future upgrades.

## Future Plans

### Interactive Admin Commands

Although `deis run` executes individual admin commands inside containers, Deis doesn't yet support long-running interactions, such as `deis run bash`. Once this infrastructure is in place, Deis can implement log tailing and other real-time features.

### Service Gateway

Deis must make it simple for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc.) and to allow developers to attach those services to applications. This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices. You can review the initial implementation and follow progress [on this GitHub issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/231).

With [CephFS](http://ceph.com/docs/master/cephfs/) and our [v1 REST API](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/reference/api-v1/) in place, we are now in a feature freeze. We will only enhance documentation and fix bugs until our first stable release in November.

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, read the [""Upgrading Deis""](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 0.15.0 Summary

### New Features
- **store-metadata** and **store-volume** expose a distributed filesystem powered by CephFS
- **controller** and **logger** share data over CephFS for high availability
- CORS headers were added to the v1 Deis REST API
- `deis passwd` allows changing the password for an account
- **routers** are published to the `/deis/router/hosts` etcd key
- Added a CoreOS debug log generator

### Under the Hood
- **controller** updated to Django 1.6.8 bugfix release
- **controller** updated to Django REST Framework 2.4.3
- **builder** switched to a pre-receive hook allowing for re-push on failed deploys
- **builder** properly compresses tarballs
- **store** and **router** image sizes continue to shrink
- `git` ignores local changes to contrib/coreos/user-data
- `make discovery-url` copies from contrib/coreos/user-data.example
- functional tests updated to use [Docker 1.3.0](https://www.docker.com/) code

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Special thanks--once again!--this release to @alebdf for (among other things) his tireless work to shrink Deis image sizes and to rewrite our container init scripts in Go.

The Deis community continues to grow, and Deis wouldn't be here without you! If we slighted your contribution to this release, please let us know so we can update.

## What's Next?

### API Documentation

With this release candidate, Deis has frozen its v1 API. Token authentication is behind us. All our endpoints are now prefixed with `/v1`. We added CORS support and an endpoint for changing passwords. What remains is improved API documentation.

### Production Ready

Deis is being used in production at companies of all sizes. We are committed to delivering our first stable release in the next few weeks. What remains is a comprehensive documentation update with a focus on how to operate Deis in production.

## Future Plans

### Interactive Admin Commands

Although `deis run` executes individual admin commands inside containers, Deis doesn't yet support long-running interactions, such as `deis run bash`. Once this infrastructure is in place, Deis can implement log tailing and other real-time features.

### Service Gateway

Deis must make it simple for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc.) and to allow developers to attach those services to applications. This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices. You can review the initial implementation and follow progress on
[this GitHub issue](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/231).

Special thanks this release to @alebdf for (among other things) his tireless work to shrink Deis image sizes and help rewriting our container init scripts in Go.

The Deis community continues to grow, and Deis wouldn't be here without you! If we slighted your contribution to this release, please let us know so we can update.

## Known Issues

### Database Provisioning

We have identified a condition where `store-gateway` will fail to start due to hung Ceph OSDs.  This causes the database to hang while starting.  The problem can manifest during platform provisioning with `deisctl start platform`.  As we research the right long-term solution, the workaround for now is to `deisctl restart store-daemon`.

### Log Data Availability

While the critical components in the Deis control plane are now highly available, we have not yet addressed availability of our **logger** component, used to store aggregated logs.  We are waiting for Ceph to support [volume mounts from within containers](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2041).  Once this lands, we can store aggregated logs in Ceph and allow _all_ control plane components to float across the cluster for complete platform HA.

## What's Next?

### API Freeze

We are close to announcing our v1 API freeze.  Token authentication is behind us.  All our endpoints are now prefixed with `/v1`.   Before we freeze it, we'd like to add [CORS Support](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/2202) and then update a handful of minor endpoints.  Once the freeze is announced, we will begin work on comprehensive API documentation.

### Production Ready

Deis is being used in production at companies of all sizes.  We are committed to delivering our first stable release in the next few weeks.  Once **logger** HA is behind us, we will focus on a comprehensive documentation update with a focus on how to operate Deis in production.

## Future Plans

### Interactive Admin Commands

Although `deis run` executes individual admin commands inside containers, Deis doesn't yet support long-running interactions, such as `deis run bash`. Once this infrastructure is in place, Deis can implement log tailing and other real-time features.

## Known Issues

### Problems with etcd leader failure

During the course of simulating cluster failures and testing platform HA, we came across a serious bug in etcd.  If the current etcd leader is killed, sometimes a new leader election does not take place leaving etcd, fleet and Deis in a badly broken state.  This issue is tracked in the [etcd project](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/863).  We are working with the CoreOS team to identify the root cause, and will update to a new CoreOS release once the issue is fixed.

### Log Data Availability

While the critical components in the Deis control plane are now highly available, we have not yet addressed availability of our **logger** component, used to store aggregated logs.  We are waiting for Ceph to support [volume mounts from within containers](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2041).  Once this lands, we can store aggregated logs in Ceph and allow _all_ control plane components to float across the cluster for complete platform HA.

## What's Next?

### Deis Upgrades

We will soon announce simple in-place upgrade instructions for Deis clusters.  Beyond that, this release also lays the groundwork for a Deis update engine based on [CoreUpdate](https://coreos.com/products/coreupdate/) which will ultimately provide fast, painless, zero-downtime upgrades of the platform control plane.

### Production Ready

Deis is being used in production at companies of all sizes.  We are committed to delivering our first stable release in the next few weeks.  Once **logger** HA and updates are behind us, we will focus on API versioning, bug fixes and a comprehensive documentation update with a focus on how to operate Deis in production.

## Future Plans

### Interactive Admin Commands

Although `deis run` executes individual admin commands inside containers, Deis doesn't yet support long-running interactions, such as `deis run bash`. Once this infrastructure is in place, Deis can implement log tailing and other real-time features.

### Service Gateway

Deis must make it simple for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc.) and to allow developers to attach those services to applications. This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices. You can review the initial implementation and follow progress [on this GitHub issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/231).

Deis is now dramatically simpler to install and manage thanks to [`deisctl`](https://github.com/deis/deisctl#deis-control-utility). If you have a CoreOS cluster, go [**get deisctl**](https://github.com/deis/deisctl#installation) and run:

``` console
$ deisctl install platform && deisctl start platform
```

Under the hood, Deis now uses the [Fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet) HTTP API directly, which greatly increases the speed and reliability of container scheduling operations.

## Known Issues

### DigitalOcean in Transition

[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) now supports CoreOS natively! The Deis community has been working overtime to shift our _contrib/_ DigitalOcean scripts to use their native support, but there is still [work to do](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/1776). You may encounter [issue #1900](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/1900) until we have this resolved.

## What's Next?

### Deis Upgrades

As Deis nears a stable release, our first priority is making sure Deis upgrades are fast, painless, and backwards compatible. We are devoting significant resources to this effort, and are working closely with the CoreOS team who has a great deal of experience with rolling upgrades. We recently [showed off](http://gabrtv.github.io/deis-coreos-meetup-2014/#/) the update system at the CoreOS meetup in SF--coming soon!

### Platform Security & HA

With Deis being used in a growing number of real-world deployments, we need to address remaining [security](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues?labels=security&state=open) issues as well as the [high-availability](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/984) of the platform itself. Deis components and hosted apps are now fronted by a user-defined number of routers, and other HA features are prerequisites for our impending stable release.

### Automated Testing

Distributed systems are notoriously difficult to test, but automated testing is critical for Deis. The Deis project will continue to invest in quality and to push the limits of what is possible with Docker and automated testing. Watch Deis get even better at http://ci.deis.io/.

## Future

### Service Gateway

Deis must make it simple for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc) and to allow developers to attach those services to applications. This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices. You can review the initial implementation and follow progress [on this GitHub issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/231).

### Interactive `deis run`

## Known Issues

### Unversioned Docker Images

There are still a few Docker images in the Deis control plane that are [not being versioned with a Docker tag](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/1174).  Though we are always careful to avoid backwards-incompatible changes, we recognize using `:latest` is not ideal.  In the next release, **every Deis component** will be versioned before being published to DockerHub for distribution.

## What's Next?

### Deis Upgrades

In our push toward a stable release, our most important priority is making sure Deis upgrades are fast, painless and backwards compatible. We are devoting significant resources to this effort, and are working closely with the CoreOS team who has a great deal of experience with rolling upgrades. We recently [showed off](http://gabrtv.github.io/deis-coreos-meetup-2014/#/) the update system at the CoreOS meetup in SF--coming soon!

### Platform Security & HA

With Deis being used for more and more real-world deployments, we need to address remaining [security](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues?labels=security&state=open) issues as well as [high-availability](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/984) of the platform itself. Deis components and hosted apps are now fronted by a user-defined number of routers, and other HA features will be a prerequisite for our stable release.

### Automated Testing

Distributed systems are notoriously difficult to test, but we know automated testing is critical for Deis. We have significantly expanded our test suites and continuous integration system. And the Deis project will continue to invest in quality and to push the limits of what is possible with Docker and automated testing. Watch Deis get even better at http://ci.deis.io/.

## Future

### Service Gateway

Deis must make it simple for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc) and to allow developers to attach those services to applications. This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices. You can review the initial implementation and follow progress [on this GitHub issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/231).

### Interactive `deis run`

Though we provide the ability to run admin commands inside containers, Deis doesn't yet support truly interactive shells into containers, such as `deis run bash`. Once this infrastructure is in place, Deis can implement log tailing and other real-time features.

Deis further improves its Docker-native experience with `deis pull`, an alternative to `git push` that imports existing Docker images directly into Deis for deployment. DigitalOcean  support is back, we've added VPC and ELB support to Deis on Amazon EC2, and we finally fixed that one bug that was bothering you.

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, read the[""Upgrading Deis""](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/operations/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

## Known Issues

### AWS ELBs

Amazon’s Elastic Load Balancer has a hardcoded [60-second connection timeout](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=33427). These timeouts result in strange behavior while using Deis on EC2.  For example, `git push` connections can be [interrupted with strange errors](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/1330). CLI commands like `deis pull` can be interrupted with `504 Gateway Timeout` errors.

While it is possible to request an ELB timeout increase from the AWS support team, it’s not an ideal solution. We are currently researching a better load-balancing solution for Deis on EC2.

## What's Next?

### Deis Upgrades

In our push toward a stable release, our most important priority is making sure Deis upgrades are fast, painless and backwards compatible. We are devoting significant resources to this effort, and are working closely with the CoreOS team who has a great deal of experience with rolling upgrades.

### Platform Security & HA

Deis components and hosted apps are now fronted by a user-defined number of routers, and other HA features will be a prerequisite for our stable release.

### Automated Testing

Distributed systems are notoriously difficult to test.  Yet, we believe automated testing is critical to the success of Deis.  We will continue to invest in comprehensive test suites that include: unit tests, functional tests, smoke tests, integration tests, acceptance tests, load tests and chaos tests that simulate failure modes.  We intend to push the limits of what is possible with Docker and the automated testing of distributed systems.  Though a work-in-progress, our test infrastructure is visible at http://ci.deis.io/.

## Future

We need to make it as easy as possible for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc) and allow developers to attach those services to applications.

## Known Issues

### Container Timeouts

We are still seeing stability issues with the public Docker Index and its content delivery network. When bootstrapping a Deis cluster, this can manifest as timeout errors, missing images and/or missing layers.  Manual `systemctl` commands will usually resolve the issue.  We are working with the Docker team on the root issue.

## What's Next?

### Deis Upgrades

In our push toward 1.0, our most important priority is making sure Deis upgrades are fast, painless and backwards compatible. We are devoting significantresources to this effort, and are working closely with the CoreOS team who has a great deal of experience with rolling upgrades.

### Improved Docker Integration

We have heard from the community and our customers that Deis needs a way to deploy and promote existing Docker images outside of a `git push` style build process. This is critical for implementing CI/CD pipelines on top of Deis. We are currently investigating the best workflow in conjunction with our friends at Docker HQ. We hope this new feature, combined with enhanced support for pushing `Dockerfile` repositories, will provide the best Docker-native experience of any PaaS on the market.

### Platform Security & HA

With Deis being used for more and more real-world deployments, we need to address remaining [security](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues?labels=security&state=open)
issues as well as [high-availability](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/984) of the platform itself. Deis components and hosted apps are now fronted by a user-defined number of routers, and other HA features will be a prerequisite for our 1.0 release.

The Deis project is proud to announce our v0.8.0 release. Deis now runs on CoreOS and no longer requires Chef. Apps deploy to clusters of machines using a simpler, faster and more reliable job scheduling interface.

If you are updating from Deis version 0.7.0 or earlier, read the [MIGRATING.md](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/blob/master/MIGRATING.md) document for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon Docker and CoreOS to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 0.8.0 Summary

### New Features
- **Cluster-wide scheduling** Deis itself and apps it deploys use the [`fleet`](https://coreos.com/docs/launching-containers/launching/launching-containers-fleet/) distributed init system for flexible scheduling across available machines.
- **Basic integration test** Test your local changes, or verify your new Deis installation with the basic [integration tests](https://github.com/deis/deis/tree/master/test) we've begun in the `test/` directory.
- **Doc updates** We added new content appropriate to our CoreOS changes to Deis' [documentation](http://docs.deis.io/), and put README.md files in each top-level directory to help you get oriented.
- **`deis create --no-remote`** allows creating a Deis app without adding a git remote.
- **New deis/logger** New, lightweight syslogd server written in Go to handle aggregation of application logs.
- **[deis/helloworld](https://github.com/deis/helloworld)** is a new Dockerfile-based example app to help you get started.
- **#deis at botbot.me** Joining the [#deis](https://botbot.me/freenode/deis/) conversation on IRC is even easier thanks to the excellent service from [botbot.me](https://botbot.me/freenode/deis/).
- **easy-fix tag** Help the Deis revolution by picking an [easy-fix issue](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues?labels=easy-fix&state=open) to start contributing.

### Under the Hood
- Moved project to https://github.com/deis/deis
- Updated to Docker 0.10.0 (deis/builder)
- Updated to Django 1.6.4 (deis/controller)
- Updated to CoreOS 298.0.0
- Implemented finite state machine for containers
- Improved scheduling unit tests and error handling
- `deis ps` is preferred to `deis containers`
- Removed unused cloud provider libraries from `pip install`

### Bug Fixes
- `deis rollback` works again
- fixed 404 on `deis logs`
- fixed coveralls.io code coverage report and badge
- isolated PostgreSQL test suite errors on Travis-CI.org to one (skipped) method
- filled a gap in available ephemeral port range for apps

### Community Shout-Outs

We are working with the Docker team on the root issue.

### Proxy for Platform Services

As part of moving Deis into Docker containers, we had to change the exposed ports for some core platform services.  For example, the Django API server is now exposed on 8000/tcp rather than 80/tcp.  We will soon update the Deis router to [expose platform services](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/535) on standard ports.

## What's Next?

In our push toward 1.0, our most important priority is making sure Deis upgrades are fast, painless and backwards compatible.  We are devoting significant resources to this effort, and are working closely with the CoreOS team who has a great deal of experience with rolling upgrades.

### Better Heroku Compatibility

We want to ensure Deis follows Heroku semantics as closely as possible.  To achieve this, we may need to make changes to the Deis client, REST API as well as new Heroku-provided features deemed necessary for Deis.  We plan to have the bulk of this compatibility implemented in the next release.

### Improved Docker Integration

We have heard from the community and our customers that Deis needs a way to deploy and promote existing Docker images outside of a `git push` style build process.  This is critical for implementing CI/CD pipelines on top of Deis.  We are currently investigating the best workflow in conjunction with our friends at Docker HQ.  We hope this new feature, combined with enhanced support for pushing `Dockerfile` repositories, will provide the best Docker-native experience of any PaaS on the market.

### Platform Security & HA

With Deis being used for more and more real-world deployments, we need to address remaining [security](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues?labels=security&state=open) issues as well as [high-availability of the platform itself](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/874).  This work has already begun in earnest, and will be a prerequisite for our 1.0 release.

## Future

### Service Gateway

We need to make it as easy as possible for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc) and allow developers to attach those services to applications.  This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices.  You can review the initial implementation and follow progress [on this GitHub issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/231).

### Interactive `deis run`

Though we provide the ability to run admin commands inside containers, we don't currently support interactive shells into containers (i.e. `deis run bash`).  Once this infrastructure is in place, this will also allow us to implement log tailing and other real-time features.

The Deis project is happy to announce our v0.7.0 release. This version improves quality and testing for our Chef recipes, allows a Deis admin to disable user registrations, and adds the `deis shortcuts` command. Deis also has new [guidelines](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to help community members contribute.

## What is Deis?

Deis is a Django/Celery API server, Python CLI and set of [Chef cookbooks](https://github.com/opdemand/deis-cookbook) that combine to provide a Heroku-inspired application platform for public and private clouds.  Your PaaS. Your Rules.

## 0.7.0 Summary

### New Features
- `deis shortcuts` shows how to type less when using the Deis CLI
- `REGISTRATION_ENABLED = False` allows a Deis admin to disallow new user registrations
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) clarifies expectations for code contributed by Deis community members
- Added a default nginx response for proxy nodes
- Added a friendly name in Vagrant for the deis-controller VM

### Under the Hood
- Added Chefspec tests, serverspec tests, foodcritic linting, and TestKitchen automation to deis-cookbook
- Added NTP client to server recipes
- Cleaned up cookbook structure
- Added `--force-yes` to install some required .deb packages
- Install `lxc` package explicitly on Ubuntu
- Updated Docker to 0.9.0

### Bug Fixes
- Vagrant contrib script creates Chef data bags again
- Pinned pep8, pyflakes, and flake8 to fix CI test errors
- Use `from django.conf import settings`, not `from deis...`
- Updated docs to catch up with the new [OpsCode](https://manage.opscode.com/) portal
- Fixed a DigitalOcean API call updated in dop 1.6
- Fixed branching logic for proxies in Chef recipe
- Removed `docker pull` timeouts
- Removed unused source attributes in `default.rb`
- Better codeblock spacing in docs

### Community Shout-Outs

We want to thank the following Deis community members for creating GitHub issues, providing support to others, and working on various Deis branches:
- @alexanderkiel - lots of testing, images aren't deleted issue
- @benton - found issue when a project contains both a `Procfile` and a `Dockerfile`
- @bflad - lots of chef and chef-docker help, ChefSpec Runners PR
- @dginther - testing, 500 errors hide EC2 response code issue
- @foxycoder - add NTP client to packages
- @johanneswuerbach - recommended EC2 m3 instances, faster + cheaper
- @jstop - testing and `--force-yes` fixes
- @zachlatta - testing, request for database example docs, Rackspace instance scaling issue

## Known Issues

### `deis logs` fails in some environments

The CLI command to display application logs may fail with a 403 error from rsyslog. We think this may occur when proper reverse DNS name resolution is unavailable. We are working on a solution for the _deis/logger_ component.

### Proxy for Platform Services

As part of moving Deis into Docker containers, we had to change the exposed ports for some core platform services.  For example, the Django API server is now exposed on 8000/tcp rather than 80/tcp.  We will soon distribute a [new proxy service](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/535) that exposes the platform components on standard ports.

## What's Next?

### Enterprise-Grade Scheduler

We are now testing a new scheduler based on [Fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/).  This will dramatically simplify the Deis controller codebase and allow Deis clusters to scale to 10,000+ nodes.

### Remove the Chef Dependency

Though [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/) will continue to be supported for deploying Deis, we are moving away from requiring a Chef Server and using Data Bags for cluster configuration.

### Promote artifacts from Docker Registry

In order to facilitate a streamlined CI/CD process, we need an ability to promote existing Docker images as builds (bypassing the `git push` process).  We are currently investigating the best workflow.

### SSL & General Security Improvements

The Deis project is excited to announce our v0.6.0 release. This version simplifies the project layout to be more developer-friendly, unites two related containers into _deis/controller_, and standardizes unit testing for Deis' own Docker images.

## What is Deis?

Deis is a Django/Celery API server, Python CLI and set of [Chef cookbooks](https://github.com/opdemand/deis-cookbook) that combine to provide a Heroku-inspired application platform for public and private clouds.  Your PaaS. Your Rules.

## 0.6.0 Summary

### New Features
- No more submodules: core components are now directly under the opdemand/deis repository
- A new component, _deis/controller_, runs both the Django REST API server and Celery for long-running tasks
- The deis/tester CI component builds each container and runs `make test` for unit testing
- CHANGELOG.md added to opdemand/deis and opdemand/deis-cookbook

### Under the Hood
- Install pip 1.5.4 in containers to avoid a stale .deb issue
- Pin local Ruby at ~ 2.0.0 for `berks upload`

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed dead ""Versions"" link when generating the docset locally

We will soon distribute a [new proxy service](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/535) that exposes the platform components on standard ports.

### Container Timeouts

We have seen some issues with timeouts due to the public Docker Index.  This can manifest as timeout errors when bootstrapping nodes.  Typically re-running the provisioning operations will resolve the issue.  We are working with the Docker team on a more robust resolution.

## What's Next?

### Docker Run Deis

Making Deis easier to install is one of our primary goals, and one of the driving forces behind our decision to containerize all the Deis components.  Running Deis should be as easy as `docker run deis/deis`.  We have a working prototype today. However, this will require some careful project restructuring on GitHub.

### Enterprise-Grade Scheduler

We are now prototyping new schedulers based on [Apache Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/).  This should dramatically simplify the Deis controller and allow Deis clusters to scale to 10,000+ nodes.

### Remove the Chef Dependency

Though Chef will continue to be the recommended way to deploy Deis, we are moving away from requiring a Chef Server and using Data Bags for cluster configuration.  Once we implement the new scheduler, we can remove the Chef dependency and provide support for other configuration management solutions (Puppet, Ansible, Salt).  

### Service Gateway

We need to make it as easy for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc) and allow developers to attach those services to applications.  This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices.

### Support for `deis push` deploys

Users should be able to push builds to Deis even if they don't use `git`.  We are investigating a `deis push` command that would not require a specific VCS.

## 0.5.1 Summary

### New Features
- **Containerization of Deis Components.** Deis' moving parts are now a set of trusted [docker images](https://index.docker.io/search?q=deis). This will result in a more modular system that is easier to deploy and to manage.
- **Enhanced Docker Integration.** `git push deis master` and `deis config` create and distribute images internally via [Dockerfiles](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/reference/builder/) and a private Docker [registry](https://github.com/deis/registry).
- **Dockerfile Apps.** In addition to Deis' broad support for Heroku-style apps, deis/builder can now build any application based on a `Dockerfile`.
- **Binary CLI.** While developers may prefer to run the Deis client from [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deis/) or a local repository, the `make client_binary` command will build an executable version with no additional requirements. Executables for some platforms are available for download:

## What's Next?
1. **_Containerization of Deis Components**_.  Converting all the Deis components to Docker images is done and being tested in the _containerize_ branch. This will result in a more modular system that's easier to deploy and manage.
2. **_Interactive `deis run`**_ Though we provide the ability to run admin commands inside containers, we don't currently support interactive shells into containers.  We will soon.

## Future

### Enhanced Docker Integration

Deis currently uses Docker as a LXC wrapper for running Heroku Buildpack slugs that are bind-mounted into containers.  We will sonn add a new `git push` build process that creates and distributes images via `Dockerfile` and a private Docker registry.  Follow progress [on this GitHub issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/152).

### Service Registry

We need to make it as easy for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc) and allow developers to attach those services to applications.  This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices.  You can review the specification and follow progress [on this GitHub issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/231).

### General Security Improvements

The controllers require [SSL configuration](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/18).  Right now controller sessions are just HTTP with cookies and passwords sent in the clear!  We've also glossed over some pretty important security features in an effort to get Deis into developers hands.  For example, we need to implement iptables host-level firewalls, improve security group default rules, use Chef recipes to [harden systems](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/27), etc.

The Deis project is excited to announce our v0.1.1 release. We've added support for Rackspace Cloud and fixed many issues found by the Deis community.

## What is Deis?

Deis is a Django/Celery API server, Python CLI and set of [Chef cookbooks](https://github.com/opdemand/deis-cookbook) that combine to provide a Heroku-inspired application platform for public and private clouds.  Your PaaS. Your Rules.

## 0.1.1 Summary

### New Features
- Rackspace Cloud provider preview (lacks some documentation)
- Formation flavors can be updated from the command-line

### Under the Hood
- Updated to Docker 0.6.4
- Updated buildstep to latest from upstream progrium/buildstep
- Updated some Ruby and Chef libraries
- Updated EC2 AMIs for faster provisioning

### Bug Fixes
- Updated python gevent to address a DNS bug
- Fixed run commands executing against proxy nodes
- Fixed CLI scaling error message when no Rackspace image exists
- Fixed 502 ""Bad Gateway"" errors on controller converge
- Fixed double converge on new release
- Fixed handling of `git push deis mater` (non-existent repo ref)
- Sitemap, Bing, ReadTheDocs.org documentation fixes

### Community Shout-Outs

We want to thank the following Deis community members for creating GitHub issues, providing support to others, and working on various Deis branches:
- @bacongobbler - while his DigitalOcean support sits just shy of the finish line, awaiting Docker 0.7, he has helped immensely by answering questions on IRC and providing suggestions and comments on several GitHub issues.
- @progrium and asm89 on IRC - Deis wouldn't be here without buildstep, and we appreciate greatly the support we've gotten and the pull requests they've accepted.
- Jesse Noller and the Rackers - [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/) has been outstanding in helping us implement first-class support for their Open Cloud, although their pyrax library already made it straightforward.
- @enyachoke, @tombh, @bacongobbler - Request, discussion, and code about a Vagrant provider implementation.

## What's Next?
1. **_Rackspace documentation**_. There is the beginning of documentation in the contrib/rackspace/README.md file, and intrepid users can certainly figure out how to provision a Rackspace controller, but we need to rework the install documentation so it treats EC2 and Rackspace (and others) as equal citizens.
2. **_Vagrant provider**_. Allowing Deis to run on a completely local ""cloud"" will enable developers to test and improve Deis without incurring any provider charges. We have this working in a ""static"" node formation currently, but there are a couple details remaining to fix, and it needs documentation. @tombh has done some solid work on a full provider implementation for Vagrant as well.
3. **_Team Support / Sharing**_. The mechanisms for sharing Formations and Apps are already implemented in a branch; we need to write more tests, implement some access control endpoints and make some changes to the gitosis data bag.

## Future

### Enhanced Docker Integration

Deis currently uses Docker as a LXC wrapper for running Heroku Buildpack slugs that are bind-mounted into [Buildstep](https://github.com/opdemand/buildstep) images.  As soon as the Docker Private Registry code stabilizes, we will be adding a new `git push` build process that creates and distributes images via `Dockerfile` and a private registry hosted on the controller.

We do not currently monitor nodes or container health -- though we have infrastructure in place to do it.

## What's Next?
1. **_Team Support / Sharing**_. The mechanisms for sharing Formations and Apps are already implemented in a branch; we need to write more tests, implement some access control endpoints and make some changes to the gitosis data bag.
2. **_Docker 0.7.0 Integration**_. The new Docker fixes several issues and removes a dependency on AUFS that may allow Deis to run on more flavors of Linux.
3. **_Improved Documentation**_ There are a few items that require better documentation including how to setup a static formation on bare metal.  We also need to provide a Tutorial that walks through advanced usage of the CLI, including how to create custom layers.

- Updated EC2 AMIs for faster provisioning

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed socket.hostname issue that prevented controller restart
- Fixed `deis open` text output
- Fixed `git push deis master` bug with PHP buildpack
- Fixed `deis logs` sometimes returning 404s
- Fixed issues with `deis create` and explicit --id flag

### Community Shout-Outs

We want to thank the following Deis community members for creating GitHub issues, providing support to others, and working on various Deis branches:
- @bacongobbler - DigitalOcean has arrived, and it's thanks to his hard work. Try it out! And Matt's continued help on IRC and GitHub is invaluable.
- @enyachoke - Vagrant support request and feedback.
- @tombh - Vagrant support--with `deis nodes:scale`--seemed nearly impossible, but Tom found a way. This will land in master soon and enable testing and development on Deis without any cloud provider charges.
- @scottstamp - Bug finding, bug fixing!
- @jeff-french - Testing and feature requests.
- @zodman, @mkuklis, @BrianHicks,@ianthedeveloper, @wiemann, @arkan, @luislavena, @cpursley, @nikolay, @Qard, @wingrunr21, @kylefinley, @phildini, @Imdsm - DigitalOcean testing and feedback.

## What's Next?
1. **_Vagrant provider**_. Allowing Deis to run on a completely local ""cloud"" will enable developers to test and improve Deis without incurring any provider charges. This works in a ""static"" node formation currently, but @tombh has a complete Vagrant provider implementation branch that is currently in testing.
2. **_Team Support / Sharing**_. The mechanisms for sharing Formations and Apps are already implemented in a branch; we need to write more tests, implement some access control endpoints and make some changes to the gitosis data bag.
3. **_Improved Documentation**_ There are a few items that require better documentation including how to setup a static formation on bare metal.  We also need to provide a Tutorial that walks through advanced usage of the CLI, including how to create custom layers.

## Future

### Enhanced Docker Integration

Deis currently uses Docker as a LXC wrapper for running Heroku Buildpack slugs that are bind-mounted into [Buildstep](https://github.com/opdemand/buildstep) images.  As soon as the Docker Private Registry code stabilizes, we will be adding a new `git push` build process that creates and distributes images via `Dockerfile` and a private registry hosted on the controller.

### General Security Improvements

Both the controller and formation proxies require SSL configuration.  Right now controller sessions are just HTTP with cookies and passwords sent in the clear!  We've also glossed over some pretty important security features in an effort to get Deis into developers hands.  For example, we need to implement iptables host-level firewalls, improve security group default rules, use Chef recipes to harden systems, etc.  If you find any other security holes, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues) and tag it ""Security"".

### Health Checks

We do not currently monitor nodes or container health -- though we have infrastructure in place to do it.

### Service Registry

We need to make it as easy for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc) and allow developers to attach those services to applications.  This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices.

The Deis project is proud to announce our v0.1.0 release.  This release includes some important new features and puts a number of backwards-incompatible changes behind us.  As of today, Deis is now ready for your dev/test environments!  In the next month or so, we hope to have Deis ready for use with production applications.

## What is Deis?

Deis is a Django/Celery API server, Python CLI and set of [Chef cookbooks](https://github.com/opdemand/deis-cookbook) that combine to provide a Heroku-inspired application platform for public and private clouds.  Your PaaS. Your Rules.

## 0.1.0 Summary

### New Features
- Formations now support multiple applications with wildcard DNS, making them truly multi-tenant
- Nodes can now be added to formations without automated provisioning, allowing manually constructed formations that can use bare-metal servers
- Layers can now function as both runtime (hosts containers) and proxy (routes to containers), which means you can test a Deis formation with 1 node
- Configuration management interface is now modularized with Chef and Mock backends; integrating other CM backends is now possible
- CLI acceptance tests now cover the majority of the Deis client workflow
- Account cancellation is now available using `deis auth:cancel`

### Under The Hood
- Updated to Docker 0.6.3
- Replaced Ubuntu `cloud-init` with the more portable `knife bootstrap`
- Refactored configuration management logic into separate `cm` package
- Created separate `provider` package with proper mock module
- Deprecated `provider.controller` module now handled by `cm`
- Deprecated `celerytasks` package in favor of `api.tasks` module
- Introduced new `Application` object that resides on a `Formation`
- Updated a number of Python libraries including: django, boto, paramiko and requests (2.0)

#### Bug Fixes
- Application endpoints no longer 500 when the application has been deleted
- Fixed problem accessing flavors with underscores in their name
- Fixed bug with containers not starting after `containers:scale` operation
- Fixed issue with `containers:list` returning a `TypeError`
- Fixed client registration failure due to bad content-type
- Fixed login issue due to new Django `is_active` behavior

#### Other Changes
- Updated http://deis.io/ site with new command-line workflows
- Docstrings cleanup across all modules
- Updated Django Admin site with new object model
- Updated `REST API` documentation with new endpoints
- Made Get Deis page shorter and simpler
- `knife` output written to celery logs regardless of success or failure (for debugging)
- `deis register` now asks for password confirmation
- Updated EC2 AMIs with new v0.1.0 images

## Community Shout Outs

We would like to give a big shout out to Matthew Fisher, aka [@bacongobbler](https://twitter.com/bacongobbler), who has made large contributions to the Deis community since our last release.  In addition to spearheading our DigitalOcean integration, he has also submitted a number of important pull requests and bug fixes for 0.1.0.  Thank you Matthew!

We'd also like to thank the following users for taking the time to file issues via GitHub:
- @jschneiderhan - [Removing user from container](https://github.com/opdemand/deis-cookbook/pull/5)
- @lakeslc - [Controller provisioning issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/169)
- @mikeclarke - [Add support for VPC in EC2 provider](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/199)
- @guestisp - [Issues with Hosted Chef Server](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/187)

## What's Next?

Now that we have some important refactoring and object model changes behind us, the Deis project will be focused on 3 main areas:
1. **Consolidating the core Deis workflow** which includes fixing bugs, improving our Chef/Docker integration and tightening platform security
2. **Extending Deis to new providers** like DigitalOcean and Rackspace, while also ensuring formations can be constructed manually from existing nodes (bare metal or otherwise)
3. **Adding a key features** including Team Support (access controls), Health Checks and a Service Registry for attaching backing services

### DigitalOcean Provider

We've had many [requests for a DigitalOcean provider](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/73).  Thanks to the efforts of @bacongobbler, we are very close!  We are now working with Moisey Uretsky and the DigitalOcean crew to get a Deis-optimized image publicly available via the DigitalOcean console and API.  The image needs to be Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with a 3.8 kernel for Docker support.  We hope to have DigitalOcean available within the next 2 weeks.

### Rackspace Provider

We are actively working on [Rackspace Cloud Integration](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/121) with the help of Jesse Noller and the team at Rackspace.  The biggest hurdle is speeding up instance boot times, which are currently not practical.  We are exploring ways to speed node boot times.  We hope to have Rackspace available in the next 2 weeks.

### Enhanced Docker Integration

Deis currently uses Docker as a LXC wrapper for running Heroku Buildpack slugs that are bind-mounted into [Buildstep](https://github.com/opdemand/buildstep) images.  As soon as the Docker Private Registry code stabilizes, we will be adding a new `git push` build process that creates and distributes images via `Dockerfile` and a private registry hosted on the controller.

We've also glossed over some pretty important security features in an effort to get Deis into developers hands.  For example, we need to implement iptables host-level firewalls, improve security group default rules, use Chef recipes to harden systems, etc.  If you find any other security holes, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues) and tag it ""Security"".

## Future

### Team Support

As of now, only a single user can control a formation or push to an application.  We need to add simple sharing features, which we can then expand upon using finer-grained access controls.

### Health Checks

We do not currently monitor nodes or container health -- though we have infrastructure in place to do it.

### Service Registry

We need to make it as easy for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc) and allow developers to attach those services to applications.  This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices.

The Deis project is happy to announce v0.0.7 which is primarily a bug fix release.  We look forward to the next round of feature development as we push toward our 0.1.0.

## What is Deis?

Deis is a Django/Celery API server, Python CLI and set of [Chef cookbooks](https://github.com/opdemand/deis-cookbook) that combine to provide a Heroku-inspired application platform for public and private clouds.  Your PaaS. Your Rules.

## What's Next?

Much of the list below has been rolled over from 0.0.6.  Now that we have these important bug fixes behind us, we can move forward with some necessary refactoring and the development of important new features requested by the community.

### Backwards Incompatible Changes

There are a few backwards incompatible changes we need to get behind us.  Firstly, we need to allow [multiple applications to be hosted on a single formation](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/120) with a single set of proxy and runtime nodes.  This will allow Deis to meet the needs of software teams looking to cheaply host multiple dev/test applications using Docker.  Secondly, we need to support [layers that serve as both proxy and runtime](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/52) to minimize node usage for small deployments and ultimately allow for cross-provider formations.  We've made lots of progress on this front already.

### Rackspace & Digital Ocean Providers

We've had many [requests for a Digital Ocean provider](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/73).  We are also interested in building an OpenStack-based provider for Deis.  That means Rackspace and Digital Ocean will be our next supported providers.  We will be using a TDD approach to help formalize the process for implementing a new provider.  This is well on its way.

### Acceptance Test Automation

Deis has many moving parts.  In order to ensure quality from release to release we are building an end-to-end test framework based on [pexpect](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pexpect/).  The test auomation will include creating formations, scaling layers, deploying applications, scaling containers and more.  The automation test will be available in the repository for anyone to run.  See the [acceptance test branch](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/tree/122-acceptance-test) for the latest on this.

### Enhanced Docker Integration

Deis currently uses Docker as a LXC wrapper for running Buildpack slugs that are bind-mounted into [Buildstep](https://github.com/opdemand/buildstep) images.  As soon as the Docker Private Registry code stabilizes, we will be adding a new `git push` build process that creates and distributes images via `Dockerfile` and a private registry hosted on the controller.  We will also allow builds to reference any existing Docker image by a fully qualified image URI.

### SSL Support

Both the controller and formation proxies require SSL configuration.  Right now controller sessions are just HTTP with cookies and passwords sent in the clear!  Before we tackle formation SSL, we need the backwards incompatible changes to applications and proxies to land in master.

### General Security Improvements

We've glossed over some pretty important security features in an effort to get Deis into developers hands sooner rather than later.  For example, we need to implement iptables host-level firewalls, improve security group default rules, use Chef recipes to harden systems, etc.  If you find any other security holes, please open a GitHub issue and tag it ""Security"".

Ready to deploy your own private PaaS based on Chef, Docker and Heroku Buildpacks?  The Deis project is excited to announce our public beta!

## What is Deis?

Deis is a Django/Celery API server, Python CLI and set of [Chef cookbooks](https://github.com/opdemand/deis-cookbook) that combine to provide a Heroku-inspired application platform for public and private clouds.  Your PaaS. Your Rules.

## 0.0.5 Summary
- New http://deis.io website with integrated documentation
- Sphinx docs including concepts, installation, usage, terms and full API reference
- Bug fixes found during end-to-end testing
- Reset of south migrations in preparation for public release
- Published deis-cookbooks to Chef community site

## What's Next?

### Enhanced Docker Integration

Deis currently uses Docker as a LXC wrapper for running Buildpack slugs that are bind-mounted into default [Buildstep](https://github.com/opdemand/buildstep) images.  We will be adding a new build process that creates and distributes images via `Dockerfile` builds and a private registry.  We will also allow builds to reference existing Docker images by a fully qualified image path.

### Log Aggregation

Deis will not be ready for production use until we have a log aggregation solution that provides end-users with a `deis logs` command.  This is critical for troubleshooting app deployment issues.  We also need a way to drain logs into tools like Splunk, Logstash, Graylog2, etc.

### Admin Commands

Most frameworks require running one-off admin commands to setup databases, inspect settings and offer visibility into the Docker-based runtime environment.  We will build a solution that offers a `deis run bash` capability.

## 0.0.4 Summary
- Buildstep integration on controller and runtime nodes, including Buildpack caching
- Git push workflow cleanup, including creating an initial web container on first push
- Pre-built EC2 AMIs to reduce average node boot times to 3-4 minutes
- New Layers feature, for custom node types with a specific Chef run list and config
- Default providers and flavors, meaning less setup time for newly registered users
- CI & Build automation including Travis integration, Coveralls code coverage and flake8
- Docstrings cleanup in prep for API docs rollout
- Massive CLI cleanup and refactoring

## What's Next?

### Better Documentation

We have several major pieces of documentation left to write, and the API docs need some love. And proper CLI docs, and the Tutorial. Lots of docs!

### Log Aggregation

Deis will not be ready for production use until we have a log aggregation solution that provides end-users with a `deis logs` command.  This is critical for troubleshooting app deployment issues.  We also need a way to drain logs into tools like Splunk, Logstash, Graylog2, etc.

- Joining the #deis IRC channel on Freenode and let us know what you think
- Creating GitHub issues (and star the project while you're at it!)
- Helping spread the word on Twitter (@opendeis), IRC, Google+, etc.

Once 0.0.5 is officially out the door on August 6, we will have a much more detailed explanation of how to get involved, contribute code and help Deis succeed.
