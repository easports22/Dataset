### It's here! üåà

This release represents a huge step forward for Preact:

- **Significantly increased performance** - in some cases by 30%.
- **Better compatibility** - `key` for PFC's, `class` integrations, capturing events.
- **Fewer edge cases** - goodbye to unnecessary mounts and DOM hierarchy errors.
- **Even smaller** - Preact had been 3.9kb for a while - now it's 3.3kb _(and headed for 2.9kb!)_

> üíÅ If you're looking to upgrade, be sure to [read the quick guide](https://gist.github.com/developit/89e0e6decb8fb5eb00def024b6fb7bd7).

## Breaking Changes

- **Pure Functional Components now have backing instances.** This means `key` now works perfectly on PFC's. It also means you could use state and lifecycle methods in Functional Components... (#163, #517, #536, #586, #474)
- **`linkState()` has been removed from Preact itself.** It is being published as a standalone [linkstate](https://npm.im/linkstate) module shortly.
- `class` and `className` no longer serialize Object values to Strings. Instead, use [classnames](https://npm.im/classnames) (#401)
- `preact/aliases` is no longer necessary. `createElement()` is now an alias of `h()` right out of the box!
- **DOM element recycling has been removed.** It was a source of issues for many, and is no longer necessary for great performance thanks to diff optimizations that reduce the number of cases where elements are removed and re-added. (#544, #351, #461, #459, #503, #535, #562)
- Undefined components references now **throw** rather than rendering `<undefined>` (#574)
- No more `Symbol`. Instead of try to use `Symbol.for('preactattr')`, `__preactattr_` is always used.
- Render debouncing now uses `setTimeout(0)` instead of Promises. It's smaller, doesn't swallow rendering errors in Safari, and was already the fallback (#357)
- The non-standard `componentDidUnmount()` lifecycle method is removed. Use `componentWillUnmount()`.
- `onXxxxCapture` is now supported for registering capturing event handlers.
- Events like `focus` and `blur` are no longer automatically capturing by default.

## Bugs Fixed

- Hierarchy errors are a thing of the past (thanks to recycler and PFC rewrites) (#380, #391)
- Fixed edge case that could cause children to be rendered out of order (#581, #603)
- Unmount lifecycle is always fired when replacing a Component with an empty element (#538, #534)
- `ref` functions attached to DOM nodes are no longer invoked for updates, only for mount/unmount.

## Other Notable Changes

- ""holes"" in JSX children are now preserved and used intelligently by the diff (#580, #540)
- Re-rendering a compositional child with a different `key` prop now triggers a remount (#338)
- JSX children passed to a Component are preserved rather than normalized (#551)
- Preact no longer relies on the `Text` or `Array` constructors for type checks, instead relying on duck typing (#595, #530)
- Ignore whitespace-only Text nodes during SSR hydration. SSR boot is now significantly faster than cold boot.

### Features
- Add support for SVG `<foreignObject>` (#278, thanks @amio!)
- Add `preact/aliases` import: A copy of preact that includes a `createElement()` alias (#168/#274, thanks @ngasull!)
- Switch to use event capturing for increased consistency with React (#266/#271, thanks @i-like-robots!)

### Breaking Changes
- Discard `keyed` nodes when diffing children instead of allowing them to be reused unkeyed
- `linkState()` no longer falls back to components path lookups and no longer auto-invokes functions
  - _These features were unused & poorly documented, and added extra weight_
- Remove default empty `options.vnode` hook
  - _While this is technically a breaking change, very few people use this API_
  - _Simply perform an existence check on the previous hook prior to calling it_

### Bug Fixes
- Fix and tests for regression in `5.7` that could cause nodes to be removed (related to #260/#277)
- Fix initial render failing to reuse certain components when picking up from SSR (#260)
- When swapping between Text, Comment and Element nodes, recycle whole orphaned trees
- Prevent the recycler from collecting non-Element nodes üêõ
- Switch back to the pre-5.7 case-sensitive `on` prefix for event handler props (#275, thanks @c2h5oh!)

Version 5 represents a fairly major jump forward.  It should be backwards-compatible, but major version increment is to signify a few new features that will not be made available in older versions - mainly built-in SVG support, and async rendering.

_Take a few seconds and upgrade, you'll be happy you did!_ üåà 

> **Tip:** If you're using [preact-compat](https://github.com/developit/preact-compat), it's best to upgrade that to `2.0.0` at the same time. Since Preact 5+ now includes built-in support for SVG, `preact-compat@2` drops the `preact-svg` dependency, saving you around `1.7kb`.

Along with the lovely `stable` stamp, this release includes some finishing touches:

#### Bug Fixes
- Fix case where a `ref` may be nulled before a component is unmounted (#232, thanks @slmgc!)
- Ensure remounting component trees invokes mount lifecycle events for deeply nested children (thanks to @kruczy @madumo et al for their help with this!)

#### New Features
- Style objects now have a lightning fast pipeline out to the DOM. (#228, thanks @trashhalo!)
  
  > **Example:**
  > `<div style={{ foo:'bar '}} />` now diffs against the current style rather than stringifying the object
