1524404,2015-07-11T13:36:13Z,2015-07-11T14:00:09Z,v4.1.0,"Improved rendering performance of images that are larger than PhotoSwipe viewport, which leads to more smooth swipe transition and decreased memory usage (up to 50% depending on image and viewport size), but affects zooming behaviour.

Composited layer for the image is now created only after it's zoomed. **Watch [screencast that demonstrates how it works now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG0QsNsG0wY)**.

This change does not affect public API, everything should work as before.

Also some small things that were changed:
- `closeOnScroll` is now blocked if animations are running or gesture is performed.
- Horizontal dragging direction is forced if previous swipe transition wasn't finished.
- Reduced duration of transition that finishes zoom gesture (300 to 200ms).
- `verticalDragRange` default value increased from 0.6 to 0.75.
- Reduced default maximum spread and double tap zoom level from 2x and 1.5x to 1.33x.

  slides).

- Fix: error appears when `captionEl:false`.
- `closeOnScroll` is now triggered only by mousewheel events and only in browsers that support transform. As various browsers trigger scroll event unpredictably (during page load, when bars appear, etc.).
- Fix: in desktop Safari PhotoSwipe that opens on page load can close (caused by above issue).
- Added `mainScrollAnimStart"" event (via @asadovsky).
- Some developers prefer to edit CSS file directly without using Sass, that’s why code comments are now visible in .css files too (in `dist/` folder), not just in .scss files.
