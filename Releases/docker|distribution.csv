**New S3 storage driver**
The default s3 storage driver is now implemented on top of the official Amazon S3 SDK, boasting major performance and stability goodness.  The previous storage is still available, but deprecated.

**Garbage Collector**
A garbage collector tool has been added to the registry.  For more details see the [garbage collector documentation](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/garbage-collection.md).

**Tagged Manifest Events**
Manifest push and pull events will now include the tag which was used in the operation (if applicable). 

**Relative URLs**
The registry can now be configured to return relative URLs in `Location` headers.

**V1 Signature disabled**
With the ongoing adoption of the schema 2 manifest format and deprecation of signatures, this option will improve pull performance by generating and returning a single libtrust signature.

## Gotchas

The RADOS storage driver has been removed.  The registry can still be used with Ceph as the storage backend using the swift driver in conjunction with the [Swift API gateway](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/swift/).

The command line format has changed to support subcommands.  To run a registry as before an additional subcommand - serve - is required.

The legacy S3 storage driver, based on `adroll/goamz` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

This Docker Registry release is the first to support the Image Manifest Version 2, Schema 2
manifest format.

This new schema version has two primary goals. The first is to move the Docker
engine towards content-addressable images, by supporting an image model where
the image's configuration can be hashed to generate an ID for the image. The
second is to allow multi-architecture images, through a ""fat manifest"" which
references image manifests for platform-specific versions of an image.

For details, see the [Manifest Schema 2 specification](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md)

### Cross Repository Blob Mount

Previously the registry required all blob data to be uploaded to a repository,
even if it existed in the Registry’s blob store.  This was a security measure to
ensure the clients owned the data they intended to upload.

Cross Repository Mount now enables an existing blob to be mounted into the target
repository if it already exists in a repository which the user has pull access
to.  This can reduce the amount of data transferred when pushing images.

For details, see: https://github.com/docker/distribution/issues/634

Additionally there are a number of performance improvements, bug fixes and
documentation updates.

### Gotchas

## What’s new?

**Google Cloud Storage Driver**
The Registry now supports Google's reliable and fast network and storage
infrastructure for layer and manifest storage.

**Read-only mode**
Enables a Registry to serve only read requests, useful to maintain read
availability during unsafe administrative tasks.

**Configurable hostname support**
Allows the specification of an externally-reachable URL for the Registry.

**Improved handling of environmental variables**
Enables environment variables to be specified which are not part of the
configuration file.

**Configurable file-existence and HTTP health checks**
Allows administrators to easily disable a registry temporarily by placing a file
on the filesystem.  Additionally a registry can be configured to check the
health of other services, such as notification endpoints.

**Enable configurable HTTP headers to be set in responses**
This feature is usable for Registry administrators to set response headers for
various uses cases including increased security.

**Redirect Support in the Swift Driver**
The Swift storage driver now supports generating download URLs in line with
other cloud storage drivers.

**Gotchas**

In order to support valid hostnames as name components, supporting repeated dash
was added.  Additionally double underscore is now allowed as a separator to
loosen the restriction for previously supported names.

**Support for listing Registry repositories**
A specification and implementation of the catalog API allows users to list the contents of a Registry

**Manifest and layer soft deletion**
Manifests and layers can now be deleted by reference.

**Pull through caching (experimental)**
The Registry can now act as a pull through cache, proxying content from the Docker Hub.

**Storage Drivers**
The following storage drivers were contributed to the distribution project by members of the open source community.

_Aliyun OSS_.   Open Storage Service (OSS) is a massive, secure and highly reliable cloud storage service provided by Aliyun.

_Ceph_.  Ceph is a free software storage platform designed to present object, block, and file storage from a single distributed computer cluster.

_Openstack Swift_.  Swift is a highly available, distributed, eventually consistent object/blob store from Openstack.

And many more...
- API specification clarifications
- Etag support for layers and manifests
- htpasswd support with bcrypt
- Unix socket support
- Client disconnection detection
- A slimmer official image
- Faster push for multi-tagged images

## Things to pay close attention to if you are upgrading

If you are running multiple registries behind a load balancer, you need to make sure that you explicitly specified the same secret for all nodes as per the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#http) ([commit](https://github.com/docker/distribution/commit/70d9a9d543f03cc368dea78a7b4b511075f88e44)).

The Length field in the Notification JSON is being deprecated in favor of Size. Both are supported in this release ([commit](https://github.com/docker/distribution/commit/26b7fe4a9161bc99b43a398f275b1e460449ca34)).

The location of the config file inside the official image has changed. If you previously mounted an external configuration file with a volume, you need to update the location to /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
