**Scheduler**:
- Swarm is now pulling Images in parallel after the scheduling decision has been made, which mitigates the error happening occasionally with Docker pulls blocking the entire scheduler.

**General stability**:
- The Node refresh loop process has been improved and does not yield to a panic when removing an Engine and trying to refresh the state at the same time.
- The refresh loop has been randomized to better handle huge scale scenarios (> 1000 nodes) where a _refresh burst_ could occur and make the Manager unstable/fail.
- General improvements and fixes for the Mesos experimental backend for swarm.

**Integration with libnetwork / Support for overlay networking**:
- It is now possible to use the new networking features with Swarm through the `network` sub-system. Commands like `docker network create`, `docker network attach` and `docker network ls` are now available through swarm.

**Integration with Docker Volume Plugins**:
- You can now use the docker volume plugin subsystem available with `docker volume`.

**Leader Election**:
- You can now specify the `--replication-ttl` flag to control how long it takes for Replicas to be notified of the Primary failure and take over the lead.

**TLS**:
- This is now possible to use TLS with discovery for `consul` and `etcd` using the new `--discovery-opt` flag.

**Scheduler**
- If an image cannot be pulled, Swarm will attempt to schedule the container on a node that already has it. This makes scheduling local images (built by `docker build` but not available on the registry) possible on Swarm.
- Prevent a crash when a freshly created container cannot be retrieved from an Engine

**Store**
- Migration to **libkv** for the storage backends
- Include bug fixes on node discovery and Leader Election for Consul, etcd, and zookeeper
- Consul backend fails explicitly when given multiple endpoints instead of discarding

**Replication**
- Fault tolerant Leader Election process

**API**
- Fix status code for `docker exec` and `docker pull`
- Fix `docker push` name matching
- Add new endpoints for `docker cp`
- Improved error messages thrown at `pull`
- Improved build process: It now accepts resource constraints (`-c` and `-m`) to schedule the build on a suitable machine.
- Fix content-type for `load`

**Docker Engine Compatibility**
- Improve `docker info` with docker client **1.7.x**
- Add `SystemTime`, `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` to docker info

**Mesos integration**
- Task creation timeout configurable
- Fix issue with hostname in library image
- Use `docker_port` attribute if available
- Add support for random ports
