It focus on Dokan speed 🚀 . A LOT has been rewritten, especially all the library 😄 and write operations for the kernel <->library communication to speed up the process.
This version is again, a **BETA**, it needs your support to make it happen (bug report, patch, contribution and ...)
[There is still a lot of work to do](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/pull/307#issuecomment-300071950)
The FUSE wrapper is included but has not been tested and there is still [warning on the build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Maxhy/dokany/build/2.0.0-269/job/rxwq52y9no9mfvl3#L6335) if some people can help !

BETA is not signed for window server 2016 (long process to do it).

See  [changelog](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/blob/Corillian-asyncio/CHANGELOG.md)
