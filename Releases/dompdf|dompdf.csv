**Notes on migrating from an earlier version of dompdf**
1. Because the _dompdf_config.inc.php_ file has been removed from this release (and is no longer referenced) all dompdf options should be set at run time.
2. The class naming conventions required a change to the _dompdf_font_family_cache.php_ file. Though we have attempted to accommodate this change your first step when encountering bugs (if you don't know where to start) might be to reset your font directory (i.e. remove custom font files and the related font metrics files, and remove the non-dist, generated, font family cache file).
3. Though a font loading script is no longer provided with dompdf you may continue to use the `@font-face` CSS rule to install fonts at run time. If you wish to pre-load fonts you may find a copy of the load_font.php script updated to run with this release of dompdf in the [dompdf-utils project](https://github.com/dompdf/utils).
4. The `FontMetrics` class is now instantiated instead of static. To simplify migration of embedded scripts from earlier versions of dompdf we provide access to the instantiated FontMetrics class via the `$fontMetrics` variable. Please update your embedded scripts. For example, `FontMetrics::get_font('helvetica')` would now be `$fontMetrics->getFont('helvetica')`.",https://api.github.com/users/bsweeney,485897,bsweeney,https://api.github.com/repos/dompdf/dompdf/releases/2610479/assets,https://api.github.com/repos/dompdf/dompdf/releases/2610479,master,https://api.github.com/repos/dompdf/dompdf/tarball/v0.7.0,https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases/tag/v0.7.0,https://api.github.com/repos/dompdf/dompdf/zipball/v0.7.0,v0.7.0,False,False

1. Because the _dompdf_config.inc.php_ file has been removed from this release (and is no longer referenced) all dompdf options will have to be set at run time.
