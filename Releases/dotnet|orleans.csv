8280324,2017-10-26T02:24:52Z,2017-10-26T23:19:43Z,v2.0.0-beta1,"Improvements and bug fixes since 1.5.2

- Breaking changes
  - Most packages are now targetting .NET Standard 2.0 (which mean they can be used from either .NET Framework or .NET Core 2.0).
    - These packages still target .NET Framework 4.6.1: `Microsoft.Orleans.TestingSiloHost`, `Microsoft.Orleans.ServiceFabric`, `Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansTelemetryConsumers.Counters`, `Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansTelemetryConsumers.NewRelic` and the PowerShell module.
  - Deprecated the Orleans Logging infrastructure.
    - Orleans now uses the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` abstractions package (MEL for short from now on).
    - The legacy Orleans' `Logger` abstraction is preserved as obsolete for backwards compatibility in a new `Microsoft.Orleans.Logging.Legacy` package, but it's just a wrapper that forwards to `ILogger` from MEL. It is recommended that you migrate to it directly.
    - This package also contains a provider for the new MEL abstraction that allows forwarding to `ILogConsumer`, in case the end-user has a custom implementation of that legacy interface. Similarly, it is recommended to rewrite the custom log consumer or telemetry consumer and implement `ILoggerProvider` from MEL instead.
    - The APM methods (TrackXXX) from `Logger` were separated into a new `ITelemetryProducer` interface, and it's currently only being used by Orleans to publish metrics. #3390
    - Logging configuration is no longer parsed from the XML configuration, as the user would have to configure MEL instead.
  - Created a `Microsoft.Orleans.Core.Abstractions` nuget package and moved/refactored several types into it. We plan to rev and do breaking changes to this package very infrequently.
  - NuGet package names were preserved for beta1, but several DLL filenames were renamed.
  - Runtime code generation was removed (`Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansCodeGenerator` package). You should use build-time codegen by installing the `Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansCodeGenerator.Build` package in the grain implementations' and interfaces' projects.
  - `SiloHostBuilder` and `ClientBuilder` are intended to replace the previous ways of initializing Orleans. They are not at 100% parity with `ClusterConfiguration` and `ClientConfiguration` so these are still required for beta1, but they will be eventually deprecated.
  - Note that when using `SiloHostBuilder` and `ClientBuilder`, Orleans will no longer scan every single assembly loaded in the AppDomain by default, and instead you need to be explicit to which ones you use by calling the `AddApplicationPartXXX` methods from each of the builders.
  - Silo membership (and its counterpart Gateway List Provider on the client) and `MessagingOptions` can be configured using the utilities in the `Microsoft.Extensions.Options` package. Before the final 2.0.0 release, the plan is to have everything moved to that configuration infrastructure.
  - Upgraded several dependencies to external packages that are .NET Standard compatible
  - Add support for Scoped services. This means that each grain activation gets its own scoped service provider, and Orleans registers `IGrainActivationContext` that can be injected into Transient or Scoped service to get access to activation specific information and lifecycle events #2856 #3270 #3385
  - Propagate failures in `Grain.OnActivateAsync` to callers #3315
  - Removed obsolete `GrainState` class #3167

- Non-breaking improvements
  - Build-time codegen and silo startup have been hugely improved so that the expensive type discovery happens during build, but at startup it is very fast. This can remove several seconds to startup time, which can be especially noticeable when using `TestCluster` to spin up in-memory clusters all the time #3518
  - Add commit hash information in published assemblies #3575
  - First version of Transactions support (still experimental, and will change in the future, not necessarily back-compatible when it does). Docs coming soon.
  - Fast path for message addressing #3119
  - Add extension for one-way grain calls #3224
  - Google PubSub Stream provider #3210
  - Lease based queue balancer for streams #3196 #3237 #3333
  - Allow localhost connection in AWS SQS Storage provider #3485

- Non-breaking bug fixes
  - Fix occasional NullReferenceException during silo shutdown #3328
  - Avoid serializing delegates and other non-portable types #3240
  - ServiceFabric membership: ensure all silos reach a terminal state #3568

- Non-static grain client via ClientBuilder enables connecting to multiple Orleans cluster from the same app domain and connecting to other clusters from within a silo.
- Support for versioning of grain interfaces for non-downtime upgrades.
- Support for custom grain placement strategies and directors.
- Support for hash-based grain placement.

### Changelog (1.5.0, 1.5.0-beta, and 1.5.0-rc)
- Breaking changes
  - Bug fix: Azure storage providers now throw `InconsistenStateException` instead of `StorageException` when eTags do not match #2971
  - Automatically deactivate a grain if it bubbles up `InconsistentStateException` (thrown when there is an optimistic concurrency conflict when writing to storage) #2959
  - Upgraded minimum framework dependency to .NET 4.6.1 #2945
  - Support for non-static client via ClientBuilder (although static GrainClient still works but will be removed in a future version). You can now start many clients in the same process, even if you are inside a Silo #2822.
    There are a few differences though:
    - Several changes to SerializationManager, mainly to make it non-static #2592
      - When deserializing a GrainReference from storage, you might need to re-bind it to the runtime by calling `grain.BindGrainReference(grainFactory)` on it or you would get `GrainReferenceNotBoundException` when attempting to use it #2738
      - Removed `RegisterSerializerAttribute` (and corresponding static Register method for registering a custom serializer). If you were using that, please read https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/Advanced-Concepts/Serialization.html#writing-custom-serializers for alternative ways to register your custom serializer #2941
  - Better serialization of `Type` values (but can cause compatibility issues if these were persisted by using the Serialziation Manager) #2952
  - Providers are now constructed using Dependency Injection. The result is that custom providers must have a single public constructor with either no arguments or arguments which can all be injected, or they need to be explicitly registered in the ServiceCollection. #2721 #2980
  - Replaced `CacheSizeInMb` setting with `DataMaxAgeInCache` and `DataMinTimeInCache` in stream providers #3126
  - Renamed the `Catalog.Activation.DuplicateActivations` counter to `Catalog.Activation.ConcurrentRegistrationAttempts` to more accurately reflect what it tracks and its benign nature #3130
  - Change default stream subscription faulting to false in EventHub and Memory stream providers, as is in other providers #2974
  - Allow `IGrainWithGuidCompoundKey` as implicit subscription grain, and sets the stream namespace as the grain key extension (subtle breaking change: previous to 1.5 `IGrainWithGuidCompoundKey` wasn't technically supported, but if you did use it, the grain key extension would have had a `null` string) #3011 
  - The static `GrainReference.FromKeyString` method is no longer accessible, it has been replaced with `IGrainReferenceConverter.GetGrainFromKeyString`, which is accessible from the `IServiceProvider`.

- Non-breaking improvements
  - Support for custom placement strategies and directors #2932
  - Grain interface versioning to enable no-downtime upgrades #2837 2837 #3055

- Revamped JournaledGrain for event sourcing with support for geo-distributed log-based consistency providers.
- Abstraction of Grain Services with fixed-placed per-silo application components with their workload partitioned via cluster consistency ring.
- Support for heterogeneous silos with non-uniform distribution of available grain classes.
- Cluster membership provider for Service Fabric.

### Changelog (1.4.0 and 1.4.0-beta)

#### New in v1.4.0 since beta
- Known issues
  - When the silo starts up, it will register IServiceProvider in the container, which can be a circular reference registration when using 3rd party containers such as AutoFac. This is bein addressed for 1.4.1, but there is a simple workaround for it at [#2747](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/2747)
  - The build-time code generator required (and automatically added) a file named `Properties\orleans.codegen.cs` to the project where codegen was being ran. The new MSBuild targets no longer do that, so when upgrading a solution with a previous version of Orleans, you should delete this orleans.codegen.cs file from your grain projects.
- Improvements
  - Support for grains with generic methods #2670
  - Do native PE files check before assembly loading to avoid misleading warnings on startup #2714
  - Throw explicit exception when using streams not in Orleans Context #2683
  - Several improvements to `JournaledGrain` API #2651 #2720
  - Allow overriding MethodId using [MethodId(id)] on interface methods #2660
- Bug fixes
  - EventHubSequenceToken not used consistently #2724
  - Support grains with generic state where the state param do not match the grain type params #2715
  - Fix ServiceFabric IFabricServiceSiloResolver registration in DI container #2712
  - Fix ConditionalCheckFailedException when updating silo 'IAmAlive' field in DynamoDB #2678
  - Ensure DynamoDB Gateway Provider only returns silos with a proxy port configured #2679
  - Fix e-Tag issue in AzureBlobStorage when calling ClearStateAsync (#2669)
  - Other minor fixes: #2729 #2691

#### Changes in v1.4.0-beta

- Notable new features
  - Support for geo-distributed multi-cluster deployments #1108 #1109 #1800
  - Added new Amazon AWS basic Orleans providers [#2006](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/2006)
  - Support distributed cancellation tokens in grain methods #1599
- Providers
  - Remove confusing parameter from AzureSilo.Start #2109
  - Minimal Service Fabric integration #2120
  - Update blob storage provider to throw on storage exceptions #1902
  - Decode protobuf using MessageParser, not dynamic #2136
  - Service Provider is no longer required by EventHubAdapter #2044
  - Preliminary relational persistence queries #1682
  - Add a function that checks the connection string for use during initialization #1987 
  - A new ADO.NET storage provider that is significantly easier to setup, which replaces the the previous one. This change is not backwards compatible and does not support sharding
    (likely be replaced later with Orleans sharding provider). The most straightforward migration plan is likely to persist the state classes from Orleans application code.
    More information in [#1682](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1682) and in [#1682 (comment)](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1682#issuecomment-234371701).

- Streaming
  - EventHub stream provider made more extensible #1861 1714
  - EventHub stream provider with improved monitoring logging #1857 #2146
  - EventHub stream provider time based message purge #2093
  - Add Memory Stream Provider #2063
  - Persistent stream pulling agent now uses exponential backoff #2078
  - Add dynamic adding / removing stream providers functionality. #1966
  - Consistent implicit subscription Id generation. #1828
  - Event hub stream provider EventData to cached data mapping #1727
- Bug fixes
  - CodeGen: fix generated DeepCopy method to call RecordObject earlier #2135
  - Fix support for serializing SByte[] #2140
  - Fix synchronization bug in Orleans/Async/BatchWorker #2133

  - Fix null reference in StreamPubSub grain. #2040
  - Some EventHub stream provider bug fixes #1760 #1935 #1921 #1922
  - Allow comments in configuration XML #1994
  - Fixed null MethodInfo in Interceptors #1938
  - EventHub stream provider Object Pools not pooling fix. #1937 
  - Harden explicit subscription pubsub system #1884
  - Fix #1869. Grain Extensions + method interception should function correctly #1874
  - Fix bug with generic state parameter caused by inconsistent use of grainClassName / genericArgument / genericInterface #1897
  - Throw meaningful exception if grain timer is created outside grain context #1858
  - Do not deactivate Stateless Workers upon grain directory partition shutdown. #1838
  - Fixed a NullReferenceException bug in ClientObserverRegistrar. #1823
- Test
  - Allow liveness config in TestCluster #1818

  - Moved Orleans Performance Counters into its own Telemetry Consumer. Now you need to explicitly register the `OrleansPerfCounterTelemetryConsumer` either by code or XML. More information in [#2122](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2122) and docs will come later. `Microsoft.Orleans.CounterControl` can still be used to install the performance counters or you can use `InstallUtil.exe OrleansTelemetryConsumers.Counters.dll` to install it without depending on `OrleansCounterControl.exe`
  - New PowerShell client Module #1990
  - Expose property IsLongKey for IAddressable #1939
  - Removed OrleansDependencyInjection package and instead Orleans references Microsoft.Extensions.DepedencyInjection #1911 #1901 #1878
  - Now using Microsoft.Extensions.DepedencyInjection.ServiceProvider as the default service provider if the user does not override it. Grains are still not being injected automatically unless the user opts in by specifying his own Startup configuration that returns a service provider.

  - ClusterConfiguration extension for setting Startup class #1842
  - Log more runtime statistics on the client. #1778
