- Simplified and re-organized the way the transactions are represented in Elasticsearch. Many fields which used to be protocol specific now share the same name. For example, the old `mysql.query`, `pgsql.query` and `http.first_line` are all named `query` now. This makes it easier to create common dashboards across protocols.
- Tuned the index template to speed up indexing and to improve the experience in the UI.
- The client location is now represented as a true geopoint instead of just the country code. This makes it work much better with the Kibana 4 map visualisation.
- Changed the defaults for the `request_raw` and `response_raw` fields to off in order to save disk space and to avoid privacy issues by default. They can be enabled on a per-protocol basis.
- Added a new `params` field in which (for example) the HTTP parameters are stored. Sensitive parameters can be safely removed based on configuration.
- Split code in sub-packages so it's easier to maintain and understand.
- The `Content-Type` header is always parsed, so the explicit `send_headers` option is no longer needed when you want to save the body.
- Fixed GeoIP data loading in the presence of symlinks. This was problematic on some CentOS systems.
- Fixed a bug where HTTP 1.1 requests having `content-length: 0` were not correctly handled
- Binaries are compiled with Go 1.4.2

- Fixed an HTTP parsing bug where the final CRLF sequence of a chunked body was separated in two packets. (#84)
- Corrected the LinkType when saving pcap files.
- Fixed bug that broke sniffing on non-standard devices (#86).
- Binaries compiled with go 1.4 now.
- Debian binaries are compiled again under Debian Squeeze, which means they work without warnings on Ubuntu 12.04 again.

- Added more flexibility into which HTTP headers are captured and indexed. You can now index all headers, a white list of headers or no headers. By default no headers are sent, which matches the default behaviour in 0.4.1 as well. See the http [configuration section](http://packetbeat.com/docs/configuration.html#http-configuration) for how to define which headers to capture and index.
- Added the option to split the `Cookie` and `Set-Cookie` headers into individual key-values pairs. This makes it easier to search for a particular `session-id` cookie, for example. 
- Added the option of specifying a header field to be used for computing the country of the request. For example, one can use the `X-Forwarded-For` header field to extract the `real ip` and the `src_country` fields to be used for the map widget in Kibana.
- Fixed a bug in which the process detection code was called on each transaction rather than periodically.

- Added two new sniffer types: af_packet and pfring. Details in the same blog post linked above.
- Switched to the redigo library for REDIS. Performance improvements by using REDIS pipelining when publishing.
- Added an option to add tags per agent. This can be useful for getting statistics for a group of servers serving the same application.
- Added the option to save a pcap file by using the `-dump` command line flag.
- Added the option to save CPU profiling data by using the `-cpuprofile` command line flag.
- Fixed a slice error in decoding the MySQL messages.

- The RPM now uses an embedded [go-daemon](https://github.com/fiorix/go-daemon) installation instead of daemonize. This removes the dependency and adds support for CentOS / RedHat / Oracle Linux 7 #59. We've written about this change [here](http://packetbeat.com/blog/application-monitoring-for-centos7-and-redhat7.html).
- Simplified default configuration file and README. Changes are backward compatible, so you can keep your existing configuration file.
- Fixed a bug in the MySQL implementation which could cause the agent to ignore the whole stream when a command is not understood.
- Fixed a bug when the agent was crashing when the GeoIP.dat file was a symbolic link.
- Fixed a stacktrace when the advertised IP header length is smaller than 20 bytes. #49
- Fixed an error in the Redis parser when dealing with fragmented TCP segments.
- Fixed a typo in the Debian init script. The pid file was wrongly named. #58

- Added new CLI options for debugging memory leaks in the agent.

Fixes:
- Disabled tokenising the `src_server` and `dst_server` items. This improves the support for hostnames containing dashes.
