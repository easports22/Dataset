  to a current limitation in retrolamba, this will require all of your class files to be fed through
  retrolambda on each build. This may adversely affect build times.
- `incremental false` is no longer deprecated but has different semantics. Instead of being a hack
  around gradle-retrolambda breaking other plugins, it now only forces all of your class files to be
  run through retrolambda instead of only the changed ones.
- Added support for android unit tests, including lambdas in the tests themselves.
- No longer patch the android jar, modify the classpath instead. This should resolve issues with
  using gradle-retrolambda with more obscure android sdks, like google glass. This should also speed
  up a clean build since it doesn't have to do any zipping shenanigans.
- Ensure the gradle plugin is compiled with java 6 compatibility. This should allow you to run
  gradle with an older version of java if you don't want java 8 set as the default. This was always
  the intention, but was broken in the last build.
- More minor changes to how the java compile task is replaced, this should ensure better
