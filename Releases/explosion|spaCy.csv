**This is an alpha pre-release of spaCy v2.0.0 and available on pip as `spacy-nightly`. It's not intended for production use. The alpha documentation is available at [alpha.spacy.io](https://alpha.spacy.io/docs). Please note that the docs reflect the library's intended state on release, not the current state of the implementation. For bug reports, feedback and questions, see the [spaCy v2.0.0 alpha thread](https://github.com/explosion/spacy/issues/1105).**

Before installing v2.0.0 alpha, we recommend setting up a clean environment.

```bash
pip install spacy-nightly
```

[The models](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases) are still under development and will keep improving. For more details, see the benchmarks below. There will also be additional models for German, French and Spanish.

You can download a model by using its name or shortcut. To load a model, use spaCy's loader, e.g. `nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm') `, or import it as a module (`import en_core_web_sm`) and call its `load()` method, e.g `nlp = en_core_web_sm.load()`.

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## üìà Benchmarks

The evaluation was conducted on raw text with no gold standard information. Speed and accuracy are currently comparable to the v1.x models: speed on CPU is slightly lower, while accuracy is slightly higher. We expect performance to improve quickly between now and the release date, as we run more experiments and optimise the implementation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Backwards incompatibilities

**Note that the old v1.x models are not compatible with spaCy v2.0.0.** If you've trained your own models, you'll have to **re-train them** to be able to use them with the new version. For a full overview of changes in v2.0, see the [alpha documentation](https://alpha.spacy.io/docs/usage/v2) and guide on [migrating from spaCy 1.x](https://alpha.spacy.io/docs/usage/v2#migrating).

### Loading models

[`spacy.load()`](https://alpha.spacy.io/docs/api/spacy) is now **only intended for loading models** ‚Äì if you need an empty language class, import it directly instead, e.g. `from spacy.lang.en import English`. If the model you're loading is a shortcut link or package name, spaCy will expect it to be a **model package**, import it and call its `load()` method. If you supply a path, spaCy will expect it to be a **model data directory** and use the meta.json to initialise a language class and call `nlp.from_disk()` with the data path.

```python
nlp = spacy.load('en')
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
nlp = spacy.load('/model-data')
nlp = English().from.disk('/model-data')
# OLD: nlp = spacy.load('en', path='/model-data')
```

### Hash values instead of integer IDs

The `StringStore` now resolves all strings to hash values instead of integer IDs. This means that the string-to-int mapping **no longer depends on the vocabulary state**, making a lot of workflows much simpler, especially during training. However, you still need to make sure all objects have access to the same `Vocab`. Otherwise, spaCy won't be able to resolve hashes back to their string values.

```python
nlp.vocab.strings[u'coffee']       # 3197928453018144401
other_nlp.vocab.strings[u'coffee'] # 3197928453018144401
```

### Serialization

spaCy's [serialization API](https://alpha.spacy.io/docs/usage/saving-loading) is now consistent across objects. All containers and pipeline components have `.to_disk()`, `.from_disk()`, `.to_bytes()` and `.from_bytes()` methods.
 
```python
nlp.to_disk('/model')
nlp.vocab.to_disk('/vocab')
# OLD: nlp.save_to_directory('/model')
```

### Processing pipelines

Models can now define their own [processing pipelines](https://alpha.spacy.io/docs/usage/language-processing-pipeline) as a list of strings, mapping to component names. Components receive a `Doc`, modify it and return it to be processed by the next component in the pipeline. You can add custom components to `nlp.pipeline`, and disable components by adding their name to the `disable` keyword argument. The tokenizer can simply be overwritten with a custom function.

```python
nlp = spacy.load('en', disable=['tagger', 'ner'])
nlp.tokenizer = my_custom_tokenizer
nlp.pipeline.append(my_custom_component)
doc = nlp(u""I don't want parsed"", disable=['parser'])
```

### Comparison table

For the complete table and more details, see the alpha guide on [what's new in v2.0](https://alpha.spacy.io/docs/usage/v2).

* **NEW:** Improved English model.

### Improved model download and installation

To increase transparency and make it easier to use spaCy with your own models, all data is now available as direct downloads, organised in [individual releases](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases). spaCy v1.7 also supports installing and loading models as **Python packages**. You can now choose how and where you want to keep the data files, and set up ""shortcut links"" to load models by name from within spaCy. For more info on this, see the new [models documentation](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/models). 

```bash
# out-of-the-box: download best-matching default model
python -m spacy download en

# download best-matching version of specific model for your spaCy installation
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

# pip install .tar.gz archive from path or URL
pip install /Users/you/en_core_web_md-1.2.0.tar.gz
pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_md-1.2.0/en_core_web_md-1.2.0.tar.gz

# set up shortcut link to load installed package as ""en_default""
python -m spacy link en_core_web_md en_default

# set up shortcut link to load local model as ""my_amazing_model""
python -m spacy link /Users/you/data my_amazing_model
```

```python
nlp1 = spacy.load('en')
nlp2 = spacy.load('en_core_web_md')
nlp3 = spacy.load('my_amazing_model')
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Backwards incompatibilities

* **IMPORTANT:** Due to fixes to the lemmatizer, the previous English model (v1.1.0) is not compatible with spaCy v1.7.0. When upgrading to this version, you need to download the new model (`en_core_web_md` v1.2.0). The German model is still valid and will be linked to the `de` shortcut automatically.
* spaCy's package manger `sputnik` is now deprecated. For now, we will keep maintaining our download server to support the `python -m spacy.{en|de}.download all` command in older versions, but it will soon re-route to download the models from GitHub instead.
* English lemmatizer data is now stored in Python files in [`spacy/en`](spacy/en) and the WordNet data previously stored in `corpora/en` has been removed. This should not affect your code, unless you have added functionality that relies on these data files.

This will be the last major release before v2.0, which will introduce a few breaking changes to allow native deep learning integration. If you're using spaCy in production, don't forget to **pin your dependencies**:

```python
# requirements.txt
spacy>=1.7.0,<2.0.0

# setup.py
install_requires=['spacy>=1.7.0,<2.0.0']
```

4424558,2016-10-18T23:24:22Z,2016-10-19T00:29:19Z,v1.0.0: Support for deep learning workflows and entity-aware rule matcher,"## ‚ú® Major features and improvements
- **NEW:** [custom processing pipelines](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/customizing-pipeline), to support deep learning workflows
- **NEW:** [Rule matcher](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/rule-based-matching) now supports entity IDs and attributes
- **NEW:** Official/documented [training APIs](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/tree/master/examples/training) and `GoldParse` class
- Download and use GloVe vectors by default
- Make it easier to load and unload word vectors
- Improved rule matching functionality
- Move basic data into the code, rather than the json files. This makes it simpler to use the tokenizer without the models installed, and makes adding new languages much easier.
- Replace file-system strings with `Path` objects. You can now load resources over your network, or do similar trickery, by passing any object that supports the `Path` protocol.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Backwards incompatibilities
- The data_dir keyword argument of `Language.__init__` (and its subclasses `English.__init__` and `German.__init__`) has been renamed to `path`.
- Details of how the Language base-class and its sub-classes are loaded, and how defaults are accessed, have been heavily changed. If you have your own subclasses, you should review the changes.
- The deprecated `token.repvec` name has been removed.
- The `.train()` method of Tagger and Parser has been renamed to `.update()`
- The previously undocumented `GoldParse` class has a new `__init__()` method. The old method has been preserved in `GoldParse.from_annot_tuples()`.
- Previously undocumented details of the `Parser` class have changed.
- The previously undocumented `get_package` and `get_package_by_name` helper functions have been moved into a new module, `spacy.deprecated`, in case you still need them while you update.

## üî¥  Bug fixes
- Fix `get_lang_class` bug when GloVe vectors are used.
- Fix Issue #411: `doc.sents` raised IndexError on empty string.
- Fix Issue #455: Correct lemmatization logic
- Fix Issue #371: Make `Lexeme` objects hashable
- Fix Issue #469: Make `noun_chunks` detect root NPs
