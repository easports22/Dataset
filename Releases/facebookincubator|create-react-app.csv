### Migrating from 1.0.7 to 1.0.8

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@1.0.8
```

or

```
yarn add --dev --exact react-scripts@1.0.8
```

You may optionally then move `react-scripts` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` since that’s how we’ll structure newly created projects. It is not necessary though.

**If you previously used `HTTPS=true` environment variable in development**, make sure you aren't affected by a now-fixed vulnerability in Webpack by [visiting this page](http://badcert.mike.works/). You can read more about the vulnerability [here](https://medium.com/@mikenorth/webpack-preact-cli-vulnerability-961572624c54).

If you left the service worker integration enabled and didn’t change how it works, you can replace `src/registerServiceWorker.js` with [this updated version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/895c475d3fc218c65dcac9a3ef3f2c0ea746a1ed/packages/react-scripts/template/src/registerServiceWorker.js).

If you haven't changed the default CSS organization, you may want to apply [this fix](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/2470/files) that makes `index.css` take precedence over `App.css` in your project.

6438148,2017-05-19T04:36:09Z,2017-05-19T04:41:47Z,v1.0.0,"## 1.0.0 (May 18, 2017)

We’ve been working on this release for the past few months, and there are many big impovements, from migrating to webpack 2 to a brand new runtime error overlay and built-in support for Progressive Web Apps.

So instead of just enumerating them here, we decided to write a blog post about all the new features.  

Check it out: **[What’s New in Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/05/18/whats-new-in-create-react-app.html)**.

Have you read it? Now let's see how to update your app to the latest version.

### Migrating from 0.9.5 to 1.0.0

First, ensure you are using the latest [Node 6 LTS or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). In 1.0.0, we have dropped support for Node 4 and NPM 2.

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@1.0.0
```

You may also optionally update the global command-line utility for bug fixes:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

#### Ensure application and test files reside in `src/`

We've never supported importing files from outside `src/`, nor have we supported running tests outside of `src/`.<br>
We also never explicitly forbid doing so, which caused confusion when things didn't work like they should.

When running or building your application, you may see a message like so:
```
You attempted to import ... which falls outside of the project src/ directory.
```

To remedy this, simply move any files that you `import` within `src/` and update your relative imports accordingly. This enforces that files that `import` each other stay in `src/`, and other folders serve different purposes (e.g. the `public/` folder just gets served from the root).

If you used relative imports outside the project directory as a way to share code with another project, consider using a [monorepo](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) instead, so that other projects are symlinked to your project's `node_modules/`. Then you can import them as a Node modules.

While running `npm test`, you may notice some of your tests are missing. Please move any top-level test directory (i.e. `__test__`, `__spec__`) or files (i.e. `*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`) into `src/`. Conversely, if you have some similarly named files that you *don’t* want Jest to run, move them outside of `src/`.

#### Import required locales for Moment.js

Moment.js locales are now purposely excluded from the bundle unless explicitly depended on.

Please import the locales you need:
```js
import moment from 'moment';
import 'moment/locale/fr';
import 'moment/locale/es';
```

#### You can no longer import file content

You can no longer import a file and expect to receive its contents as an encoded string.<br>
This behavior was confusing and inconsistent depending on the file size.

Importing files with unknown extensions will now always include them into the build and return a valid URL.

If you'd like to import a file's contents as a string, consider [contributing to #1944](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1944).
For the time being, you must embed assets within an export:

```js
// sample.txt
export default `i want
this data as a string
`;
```

You can then import this as so:
```js
import sampleText from './sample.txt';

// ...
```

#### Confusing window globals can no longer be used without `window` qualifier

Please prefix any global method with `window.`, you may experience this with methods such as `confirm`.

Simply update references from `confirm` to `window.confirm`.

Note that this new lint error will likely uncover legitimate accidental uses of global variables where you meant to define a local variable instead.

#### Why is my import erroring out?

You can no longer use AMD import syntax, nor define an import anywhere other than the top of the file.

This is to reduce confusion around import statements, which do not allow you to evaluate code between them.

#### I see many accessibility warnings

We have enabled a new set of rules to help make applications more accessible, please take time to learn about the errors and fix them.

You can search for every lint rule name in the right column and read its description on the web. The fixes are usually very simple.

#### I see many warnings about PropTypes and createClass

We have enabled the lint warnings about React APIs deprecated in React 15.5.
You can automatically convert your project to fix them by running the [corresponding codemods](https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod).

#### How do I make my tests work with Jest 20?

Please refer to the [Jest 19](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2017/02/21/jest-19-immersive-watch-mode-test-platform-improvements.html#breaking-changes) and [Jest 20](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2017/05/06/jest-20-delightful-testing-multi-project-runner.html#breaking-changes) breaking changes for migration instructions.

If you use snapshots, you will likely need to update them once because of the change in format.

#### Flexbox 2009 spec is no longer polyfilled

The old, 2009 specification for Flexbox is [deprecated and is 2.3x slower than the latest specification](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/old-flexbox).

We are no longer polyfilling it automatically.

#### I see ""Definition for rule 'jsx-a11y/alt-text' was not found (jsx-a11y/alt-text)"" in the editor

Follow these steps if you see errors about missing lint rules in the editor.

1. Ensure that in your editor ESLint settings you have ""Use Global ESLint"" turned off
2. Run `npm install` in your project (or `yarn`)
3. Quit your editor completely (ensure its process doesn't hang around)
4. Start the editor again

If you still have the problem please file an issue.

#### How to turn my app into a [Progressive Web App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app)?

After the regular update procedure above, add these line to `<head>` in `public/index.html`:

```html
    <meta name=""theme-color"" content=""#000000"">
    <!--
      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is added to the
      homescreen on Android. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/
    -->
    <link rel=""manifest"" href=""%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json"">
```

Then create a file called `public/manifest.json` that looks like this:

```js
{
  ""short_name"": ""React App"",
  ""name"": ""Create React App Sample"",
  ""icons"": [
    {
      ""src"": ""favicon.ico"",
      ""sizes"": ""192x192"",
      ""type"": ""image/png""
    }
  ],
  ""start_url"": ""./index.html"",
  ""display"": ""standalone"",
  ""theme_color"": ""#000000"",
  ""background_color"": ""#ffffff""
}
```

Finally, create `src/registerServiceWorker.js` with [this template](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/bf9eca25f519c73f69cff20ac49ce9500e578fe0/packages/react-scripts/template/src/registerServiceWorker.js), [import it](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/bf9eca25f519c73f69cff20ac49ce9500e578fe0/packages/react-scripts/template/src/index.js#L4) from `src/index.js` and [call the function it exports](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/bf9eca25f519c73f69cff20ac49ce9500e578fe0/packages/react-scripts/template/src/index.js#L8).

#### Anything missing?

This was a large release, and we might have missed something.

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/new) and we will try to help.

#### Some of my tests started crashing because of unhandled rejections

Unhandled Promise rejections will now crash tests. You can fix them by explicitly catching the errors you don’t care about.

#### :rocket: New Feature
- `react-scripts`
  - [#1489](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1489) Support setting `""homepage""` to `"".""` to generate relative asset paths. ([@tibdex](https://github.com/tibdex))
    
    Applications that don’t use the HTML5 `pushState` API can now be built to be served from any relative URL. To enable this, specify `"".""` as your `homepage` setting in `package.json`. It used to be possible before with a few known bugs, but they should be fixed now. See [Serving the Same Build from Different Paths](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#serving-the-same-build-from-different-paths).
  - [#937](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1504) Add `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable for advanced use. ([@EnoahNetzach](https://github.com/EnoahNetzach))
    
    If you use a CDN to serve the app, you can now specify `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable to override the base URL (including the hostname) for resources referenced from the built code. This new variable is mentioned in the new [Advanced Configuration](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#advanced-configuration) section.
  - [#1440](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1440) Make all `REACT_APP_*` environment variables accessible in `index.html`. ([@jihchi](https://github.com/jihchi))
    
    This makes all environment variables previously available in JS, also available in the HTML file, for example `%REACT_APP_MY_VARIABLE%`. See [Referencing Environment Variables in HTML](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#referencing-environment-variables-in-the-html).
- `react-dev-utils`
  - [#1148](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1148) Configure which browser to open with `npm start`. ([@GAumala](https://github.com/GAumala))
    
    You can now disable the automatic browser launching by setting the `BROWSER` environment variable to `none`. You can also specify a different browser (or an arbitrary script) to open by default, [as supported by `opn` command](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn#app) that we use under the hood. See [Advanced Configuration](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#advanced-configuration).

#### :boom: Breaking Change
- `react-scripts`
  - [#1522](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1522) Upgrade dependencies. ([@Timer](https://github.com/Timer))
  - [#1432](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1432) Bump Jest version. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon))

    Jest has been updated to 18 and has introduced some [breaking changes and new features](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/12/15/2016-in-jest.html).
- `react-scripts`, `react-dev-utils`
  - [#1264](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1264) Remove interactive shell check when opening browser on start. ([@CaryLandholt](https://github.com/CaryLandholt))
    
    Non-interactive terminals no longer automatically disable launching of the browser. Instead, you need to [specify `none` as `BROWSER` environment variable](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#advanced-configuration) if you wish to disable it.

### Migrating from 0.8.5 to 0.9.0

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.9.0
```

Then, run your tests. If you are affected by breaking changes from Jest 18, consult [blog post](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/12/15/2016-in-jest.html), [changelog](https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#jest-1800), and [documentation](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/getting-started.html). You might need to update any snapshots since their format might have changed.

If you relied on the browser not starting in non-interactive terminals, you now need to explicitly specify `BROWSER=none` as an environment variable to disable it.

    We added [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) checks to the build output in 0.8.2 but it turns out that they may fail in browsers using special compression proxies, such as Chrome on Android, when served over HTTP.

#### :rocket: New Feature
- `react-scripts`
  - [#1176](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1176) Add Subresource Integrity support. ([@XVincentX](https://github.com/XVincentX))
    
    The generated HTML now includes [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) attributes ensuring that your users aren't served malicious code if your CDN gets compromised.

#### :bug: Bug Fix
- `react-scripts`
  - [#1197](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1197) Let Jest handle all file types. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon))
    
    Since 0.8.0, we started treating imports of any unknown file extensions as URLs. However, we had to revert this change for the test configuration in 0.8.1 because of a bug causing false positives. In 0.8.2, we are fixing this and making test configuration treat imports with unknown extensions the same way as we do in the browser environment.
  - [#1194](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1194) Only honor relative `NODE_PATH`. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon))
    
    Historically we have allowed specifying `NODE_PATH` environment variable as a way to allow “absolute imports”. For example, running `NODE_PATH=src npm start` in Bash or `set NODE_PATH=src&&npm start` in Windows Cmd would let you import anything inside `src` without specifying a relative path. However, we found a few nasty edge cases when Node.js core modules end up being in `NODE_PATH` and erroneously become bundled. As a result the build would crash on some systems when some libraries are imported. To fix this, we now only honor relative paths from `NODE_PATH` in Create React App. This means the existing use case for absolute imports is still supported (`src` in the example above is relative), but absolute paths in `NODE_PATH` (such as paths to Node.js core modules) will be ignored.
  - [#1188](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1188) Update Webpack to fix source map issues. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon))
    
    Since 0.8.0, we show source maps in development instead of the compiled code. However, it has come to our attention that Webpack's source map implementation had issues interpreting Babel output, and caused source maps to be wrong and breakpoints to be unusable in some cases. Webpack has released a fix for this, and we have updated the minimal version of Webpack that we are using.
  - [#1180](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1180) Use `file-loader` for svgs. ([@bogdansoare](https://github.com/bogdansoare))
    
    Since 0.8.0, we are treating all imports with non-JS/CSS extensions the same way. Importing them gives you a string with their URL, and if their content is small enough (less than 10K), the URL is in fact an inlined [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs). However, this doesn't work well with SVGs in case you use them for a sprite system since fragments don't work in data URIs, and it's wasteful to inline the same sprite SVG many times. To fix this, we have added an exception so that SVG files never get inlined.
- `react-dev-utils`
  - [#1165](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1165) Chrome 'open tab' reuse an empty tab when possible. ([@n3tr](https://github.com/n3tr))
    
    Fixes an issue that caused two tabs to get opened instead of just one. It also fixes some cases where the window with the existing tab would not get activated.
- `babel-preset-react-app`
  - [#1179](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1179) Fix Babel issues in tests by applying the right transforms. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon))
    
    Fixes regressions in test environment that caused syntax errors with generators and `async` / `await`.

#### :nail_care: Enhancement
- `eslint-config-react-app`
  - [#1191](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1191) Relax peerDependencies for ESLint preset. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon))
    
    This allows the preset to be used in more apps without peer dependency conflicts. We still pin the exact versions in apps that haven't ejected for extra safety.
  - [#1159](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1159) Make jsx-no-undef rule an error. ([@existentialism](https://github.com/existentialism))
    
    Using an undefined type in JSX is now treated as a hard lint error because it is guaranteed to crash application at runtime.
- `react-scripts`
  - [#1175](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1175) Remove path module from webpack config on eject. ([@harunhasdal](https://github.com/harunhasdal))
    
    This makes the output after ejecting a bit cleaner.
  - [#1120](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1120) Add `testURL` to Jest config. ([@spudly](https://github.com/spudly))
    
    This fixes an error when running tests that interact with History API in jsdom.

#### :rocket: New Feature
- `react-scripts`
  - [#944](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/944) Crash the build during CI whenever linter warnings are encountered. ([@excitement-engineer](https://github.com/excitement-engineer))
    
    Linter warnings and errors are now checked during a continuous integration build (set by the `CI` environment variable) and the build will fail if any issues are found. See [Continuous Integration](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#continuous-integration) for more information.

- `create-react-app`, `react-scripts`
  - [#898](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/898) Support Yarn. ([@fson](https://github.com/fson))
    
    Yarn is a new fast, reliable and secure alternative to the `npm` client. If you have Yarn installed, `create-react-app` will use it to install packages when you create an app. It also creates a `yarn.lock` file that should be checked into source control (e.g. git). This ensures the same versions of packages will be installed each time `yarn install` is run, on any machine.
    
    `react-scripts` now also displays instructions using `yarn` commands for projects using Yarn (projects having a `yarn.lock` file).
    
    To create a project using Yarn, simply install `yarn` and use `create-react-app` like before:
    
    ```
    npm install -g yarn create-react-app@latest
    
    create-react-app my-app  # Packages are now installed with Yarn.
    ```

#### :boom: Breaking Change
- `babel-preset-react-app`
  - [#902](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/902) Enable useBuiltIns option on object-rest-spread. ([@existentialism](https://github.com/existentialism))
    
    Object rest spread and JSX now use the native `Object.assign()` method instead of Babel's helper function. If you are using `babel-preset-react-app` directly in your project _and_ targeting browsers that don't have `Object.assign()` available, from now on you need a polyfill for it (e.g. [`object-assign`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-assign)).
    
    **Note:** `react-scripts` already adds this polyfill, so no changes are necessary in Create React App projects.

    `react-scripts` now treats imports with any unknown file extension as a resource. Files with a size below 10 KB are inlined using a data URI and larger files copied to the build folder. This removes the need for an internal [whitelist of supported file extensions](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/667).

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

### Breaking Changes in 0.5.0

#### Global ESLint Plugin Versions

If you used a global ESLint installation for the editor integration, you’ll need to install [these versions of global ESLint packages](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/c092086b1b256fd081f10744f90d216dd5217e29/packages/eslint-config-react-app/package.json#L14-L19).

#### Moving `index.html` into `public` Folder

You’ll also need to create a new folder called `public` in the root of your project. Then, move `index.html` and files it references (such as a favicon) into that folder.

You can no longer reference any files from `./src` in `index.html`. Instead, `public/index.html` can now only reference files other inside of the `public` folder using a special variable called `%PUBLIC_URL%`.

For example, instead of:

``` js
<link rel=""shortcut icon"" href=""./src/favicon.ico"">
```

You would need to move both `index.html` and `src/favicon.ico` into the `public` folder, and change `<link>` to look like this:

``` html
<link rel=""shortcut icon"" href=""%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico"">
```

This ensures it become a part of the build output, and resolves correctly both with client-side routing and non-root `homepage` in `package.json`.

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

### Breaking Change in 0.4.0

Paths like `/src/somefile.png` used to be served in development, but only by accident. They never worked in production builds. Since 0.4.0, we [don’t serve static files by default in development anymore either](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/551). This removes a dangerous inconsistency that we never intentionally supported.

If you need a static file to be part for the build, [import it from JavaScript and you will get its filename](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#adding-images-and-fonts). This ensures it gets included into the production build as well, and its filename contains the content hash.

If you used static files with `<link href>`, [read this new guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#referring-to-static-assets-from-link-href) on how to make sure these files get included into the builds. For example, you can replace `<link href=""/src/favicons/favicon-32.png"">` with `<link href=""./src/favicons/favicon-32.png"">`, and then Webpack will recognize it and include it into the build.

If you referenced some other files from `index.html`, please file an issue to discuss your use case. In the meantime, you can serve them from a separate static server until your use case is supported.

([Jest project contributors](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed), [@cpojer](https://github.com/cpojer) in [#250](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/250), [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#378](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/378), [#530](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/530), [#533](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/533))
- Static files such as CSS, images, and fonts, can now exist outside `src` directory. ([@fson](https://github.com/fson) in [#504](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/504))
- **Breaking Change:** Local paths in `<link href>` in `index.html` will now be correctly resolved, so deleting `favicon.ico` is not an error anymore. ([@andreypopp](https://github.com/andreypopp) in [#428](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/428))
- Removed an annoying lint rule that warned for `<div ref={node => this.node = node}>`. ([@mrscobbler](https://github.com/mrscobbler) in [#529](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/529))
- Temporarily disabled `react-constant-elements` Babel transform because of its bugs. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#534](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/534))
- Fixed a permission issue with Docker. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [73c940](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/commit/73c940a73205d761230f8d6bf81ecfd460ba28a9))
- Fixed an issue with generator syntax in Jest that occurred in an alpha release. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#535](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/535))

### Global CLI (`create-react-app`)
- You can now create a project in a folder that already contains an `.idea` folder, which is necessary for future WebStorm integration. ([@denofevil](https://github.com/denofevil) in [#522](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/522))

### Migrating from 0.2.3 to 0.3.0

You may optionally update the global command (it’s not required):

```
npm install -g create-react-app@0.3.0
```

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.3.0
```

#### Breaking Change

Now `favicon.ico` is not treated specially anymore.  
If you use it, move it to `src` and add the following line to `<head>` in your HTML:

``` html
<link rel=""shortcut icon"" href=""./src/favicon.ico"">
```

#### New Feature

Since 0.3.0 added a test runner, we recommend that you add it to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` like this:

``` js
  // ...
  ""scripts"": {
    // ...
    ""test"": ""react-scripts test --env=jsdom""
  }
```
