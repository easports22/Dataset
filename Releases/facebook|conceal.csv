- Performance improvement for streams:
  - reading uses the same client buffer, no need for extra allocation
  - no artificially chunked decryption reduces JNI calls (N div 256 for a reading buffer of size N)
  - writing can receive an auxiliar buffer allocated by the client reducing JNI calls by the same proportion and enabling buffer reuse
