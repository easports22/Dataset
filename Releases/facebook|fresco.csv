Rewritten implementation for animated images (GIFs and animated WebPs) with better performance, particularly when showing multiple GIFs.

This brings improved frame caching and memory management, better control for users of Fresco, new features and some GIF rendering issues have been fixed.

## Other Updates in 1.4.0

* Support for `Bitmap.prepareToDraw` to upload bitmaps to the GPU ahead of time (as suggested by @
    ChrisCraik) - enabled via `ImagePipelineExperiments`
* Fixed Shared Element Transitions. You have to manually call `draweeView.setLegacyVisibilityHandlingEnabled(true)`
* Per-image custom drawable factory support
* Caching improvements
    * You can now set a custom cache trim strategy for the image pipeline
    * Added `BaseCacheEventListener` that implements `CacheEventListener` for convenience
* Easier synchronous requests with `DataSources#waitForFinalResult`
* Fixed `IncreasingQualityDataSource` to keep the low res image if the high res request fails
* Various other bug fixes and improvements: BitmapCounterProvider, Media Variations, Progressive JPEGs, EXIF parsing, ZoomableDraweeView touch logic, DraweeView attributes in Android Studio

## Breaking Changes

### AnimatedDrawable

The old animation code has been removed, including `AbstractAnimatedDrawable`, `AnimatedDrawable`, or `AnimatedDrawableSupport` . Change your casts to `AnimatedDrawable2`.
We also removed `com.facebook.fresco:animated-base-support` since it is no longer needed.
### DrawableFactory

Moved DrawableFactory to `com.facebook.imagepipeline.drawable.DrawableFactory.` Please change your imports if you're using custom drawable factories.

### Small cache threshold

Removed this option from `ImagePipelineExperiments` as well as related code.

### Internal changes

Added `void onNewResult(T newResult, @Status int status)` to `Consumer` interface.

### Removed deprecated methods

* `ImagePipeline#getDataSourceSupplier(ImageRequest, Object, boolean)`
* `EncodedImage#setEncodedCacheKey(CacheKey)`
* `EncodedImage#getEncodedCacheKey()`
* `GenericDraweeHierarchyBuilder#setActualImageMatrix()`
* `GenericDraweeHierarchyBuilder#getActualImageMatrix()`

## Sample Apps (now with Kotlin!)

We've updated our Showcase sample app to include more samples and merged other sample apps into it.

- Showcase application improved and new examples added
- New onUltimateProducerReached() callback method added to ProducerListener.
- It's now possible to load resources using a qualifying resource URI. This allows for loading resources that are not part of the application's main package.

## Breaking Changes

### PooledByteBuffer and PooledByteBufferInputStream

These two classes have moved package from `com.facebook.imagepipeline.memory` to `com.facebook.imagepipeline.memory`. If you directly make use of either class, simply update your imports.

### ProducerListener

The `ProducerListener` interface has a new callback: `onUltimateProducerReached()`. This identifies the producer which was ultimately responsible for producing the result which was passed back, so can give an idea about how many requests are satisfied from caches.

If you have an implementation of `ProducerListener` or `RequestListener` you will need to add an implementation of this method.

4933535,2016-12-14T18:45:00Z,2016-12-15T19:16:43Z,Version 1.0.0 ðŸŽ‰,"The version bump was overdue - the library is stable for a long time. It is used in all the major Facebook apps for years (Facebook, Messenger, Moments, Facebook Lite). On top of that it also powers a lot of non Facebook apps like Twitter, Wikipedia and Vimeo. We were careful with breaking changes for at least a year - so here we go: **Version 1.0**!

With this release, Fresco allows you to easily add **support for more image formats and custom decoders**. This is configurable using the `ImageDecoderConfig` class. See our sample application for a practical example.

Fresco now allows you to provide it with more semantic information about different versions and URIs of the same image. The concept is called **Media Variations** and it uses a `media id` to group different URIs that refer to the same underlying source image that might be loaded in different sizes. Fresco will try to satisfy a new request by first looking if another already cached image with the same `media id` exists and displaying that. See our sample application for a practical example.

We added a **Debug overlay** for drawees. They can show you how large the underlying image is with respect to the actually drawn screen area. This is helpful in order to screen you app for images that should be loaded at a smaller resolution. You can activate it using the `DraweeConfig` parameter of `Fresco.initialize(...)`.

If you are manually dealing with `CloseableReferences` you might find yourself leaking memory. One can now specify `UnclosedReferenceListener` in order to log these leaks or crash in debug builds.

**`DraweeSpan`** and **`BetterImageSpan`** are new `Spannable` implementations for displaying `Drawee`s within text.

## Breaking Change

Fresco now longer has a direct dependency on the Android Support library. Instead, it expects certain part of the support library to be provided by the including application. If you do not include the Android Support Library yourself already, you will have to add the following line to your `build.gradle` file:

```
compile ""com.android.support:support-core-utils:24.2.1""
```

With this version we have also removed methods and classes that have been marked as `@Deprecated` for some time. For all those cases there are new APIs that are easy to use.

## Breaking Changes

In support library 24.2 Google split the library into smaller parts. By upgrading our support library dependency to 24.2.1, we've been able to specify the parts which Fresco needs (which is very little).

We recommend both upgrading your support library dependencies similarly and making sure you explicitly depend on the parts of the support library that you need. This can reduce your APK size.

## Breaking changes

### Experimental config options

To make it clearer which options in `ImagePipelineConfig` are included for experimental purposes, these have been moved into a separate `ImagePipelineExperiments` class. Options here should be expected to be volatile and liable to be changed or removed in future releases. Changing these values from their defaults is not recommended in most cases.

These methods are still available in a chain while building your config so if you had the following before:

```
ImagePipelineConfig config = ImagePipelineConfig.newBuilder(context)
    .setForceSmallCacheThresholdBytes(maxSmallImageBytes)
```

you can fix it by changing it as follows:

```
ImagePipelineConfig config = ImagePipelineConfig.newBuilder(context)
    .experiment().setForceSmallCacheThresholdBytes(maxSmallImageBytes)
```

### CacheEventListener

All `CacheEventListener` methods now receive a new `CacheEvent` object.

If you have a custom implementation you will need to add the extra parameter to each method. In the case of `onEviction()` the old parameters have been replaced so you will also need to extract the values from the event if you are making use of them.

### CacheKeyFactory

All `CacheKeyFactory` methods now receive an extra parameter with the caller context object that can be specified when the image is requested.

If you have a custom implementation you will simply need to add the extra parameter to each method.

### Multiple drawee backgrounds

It was previously possible to specify multiple backgrounds in a drawee hierarchy. This is still possible but deprecated and if you specify multiple backgrounds these can no longer be rounded.
