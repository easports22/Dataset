This is a security release, it includes fixes for weaknesses in several virtual tables.

Please check out the new [`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/blob/master/SECURITY.md) security issues tracker for more details. This release has updated several dependency formulas. The focus for those updates was also security related. While it is unclear if weaknesses in dependencies have an exact adverse effect on osquery, it is important to update them regardless. These updates mean a stronger and safer set of binary versions available on the https://osquery.io downloads page.

## Bug fixes

This release merges the osqueryi shell into the osqueryd daemon. Both binaries will still be shipped with all platforms packages and the osqueryi binary is simply a copy of osqueryd binary. The core logic of the shell meerly checks the name of the running executable, and if it's osqueryi we launch into the shell. This release also sees various changes to our third party dependencies. Firstly we have dropped snappy and LZ4 from our dependency chain in favor of ZSTD, so these packages will no longer be required for builds. Further we have upgraded all platforms to make use of Boost 1.65.0, and finally we have successfully seen Firehose/Kinesis logging brought to the Windows platform. Lastly a few hardening changes to the RocksDB interface will ensure a better and more robust interface with the local caching database and strive to recover from database corruption.

This release fixes many bugs in the Windows version vastly improving stability and some tables. The SQLite version was also bumped to 3.19.3 and improvements were made to inotify eventing on linux. The preferences table on Darwin has also been changed and it's core functionality moved to a new plist table. See (#3455) for more details as this may require updates to any scheduled queries that use this table. For more complete release notes, see the highlights below.

**Several bug fixes pertaining to Windows:**
* (#3478) Fixed a crash in interface_details - If WMI data was empty, an invalid access occurred.
* (#3481) Choco build output directory change - Building a package will now drop you in the directory you started in, not the build directory.
* (#3475) Fixed worker respawn logic - Killed workers were not being respawned correctly due to a lack of early exit.
* (#3470) system_info FQDN - The system_info table on Windows will now return the full FQDN, not just the host name.
* (#3484) Additional install locations - The programs table checks more locations to find installed applications.

This release brings osquery to Windows! Currently only Windows 8+ is supported, and many features that exist on POSIX platforms are still being ported. Our Windows support includes an abstraction on top of the WMI architecture provided by Microsoft thus allowing rapid development of new virtual tables. We include a dependency and build management system to statically compile binaries independent of system location or supported platform. More simply, we can support a single build that may be deployed to any Windows version (8+).

This release introduces a new Brew-based build redesign (#2251) for Linux and OS X. This has enabled a variety of new CI features, including:
- `clang-format` checking to insure style uniformity.
- `cppcheck` to catch performance bugs via static-analysis.
- Version-pinned LLVM with sanitization frameworks for nightly dynamic-analysis and memory leak checking.
- `zzuf` for DIY fuzz testing via `make fuzz`.
- And of course, far-fewer dependency errors due to build host drift.

As always, we hold performance as an essential feature and project goal. With 2.0 we are also including a user-experience focus. The most significant related change is to `TablePlugin`s; we have added a column-attribute and table-attribute description language so SQLite and the `osqueryi` shell can make decisions based on how tables and columns are used. As a quick example, consider selecting from `file`-- in 2.0 if you do not include a path or directory the table will emit a warning; if you include an `_events`-based table in your schedule the set-difference calculations will be skipped. 

### Plugin API changes

#2412 Rename `phys_footprint` to `total_size` in the `processes` table.
#2525 Promote host UUID to version 2 meaning Linux UUIDs become board UUIDs.
#2527 Add extensions SDK incompatibility checking.

Version 2.0.0 is backward compatible with extensions SDK to version 1.7.3. A warning will be emitted if an older extension is connected.

### Important changes

#2523 Refactor events and remove the 10/3600 indexes this yields ~4x speed improvement.
#2500 Improve Thrift exit verbosity on all platforms by forwarding output to Glog.
#2504 Change `--utc` to default as `true`.

This is a breakfix release for those using the AWS logger plugins on OS X.

The `firehose` and `kinesis` logger plugins use the cpp-netlib TLS client libraries, which depend on ASIO, boost, and a TLS implementation provided by OpenSSL or LibreSSL. This release allows the plugins to take advantage of `--tls_server_certs` and other TLS-related configuration options. If you are using these logger plugins and receiving invalid certificate issue, you need to provide a PEM bundle using the aforementioned flag.

This is a release rollup of fixes since 1.7.4.

There is an optional Thrift API change for extensions: the `shutdown` method.
The osquery core, extension manager, will attempt to call this optionally-implemented method
immediately before it shuts down. This request is blocking and allows an extension to perform
cleanup before its watcher thread quits.

#2139 Update the AWS APIs to version 0.12.4

### Plugin API changes

There are two breaking API changes to **TablePlugin** and **LoggerPlugin** that will affect extensions.

TablePlugins must now return `osquery::TableColumns` as a set of `tuple`s:

``` cpp
class exampleTablePlugin : public TablePlugin {
private:
  TableColumns columns() const {
    return {
      std::make_tuple(""key"", TEXT_TYPE, DEFAULT),
      std::make_tuple(""value"", TEXT_TYPE, DEFAULT),
    };
  }
};
```

Logger plugins use `::init` and `::logStatus` must (1) change the return type for `::init` to `void` and define a `::usesLogStatus` method:

``` cpp
class exampleLoggerPlugin : LoggerPlugin {
 public:
  void init(const std::string& name,
      const std::vector<StatusLogLine>& log) override;

  bool usesLogStatus() override { return true; }
};

#2135 Limit SMBIOS reads to the 1M-2M region
#2116 Add `::removeService` to the Dispatcher API to fix kernel tests

The certificates table on OS X now supports both DER and PEM formats.
The use of `boost::thread` has been removed, as well as shared mutexes.
TLS SNI support via cpp-netlib's 0.12-rc1 build.

### Extensions should no longer use `Initializer::shutdown()`

Prior to 1.7.2 an extension's main file resembled:

``` cpp
 int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
   osquery::Initializer runner(argc, argv, OSQUERY_EXTENSION);
  auto status = startExtension(""your_name"", ""1.0.0"", ""1.7.2"");
   if (!status.ok()) {
     LOG(ERROR) << status.getMessage();
   }

  // Finally shutdown.
  runner.shutdown();
   return 0;
 }
```

It should now use the following flow:

``` cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  osquery::Initializer runner(argc, argv, OSQUERY_EXTENSION);
  auto status = startExtension(""your_name"", ""1.0.0"", ""1.7.2"");
  if (!status.ok()) {
    LOG(ERROR) << status.getMessage();
    runner.requestShutdown(status.getCode());
  }

  // Finally wait for a signal / interrupt to shutdown.
  runner.waitForShutdown();
  return 0;
}
```

### `NULL`s in results

`NULL` values are now allowed in column results. 
This means values which were NOT filled in for `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, and `DOUBLE` types would previously, in error, return a -1. This was very confusing as we do not differentiate between signed/unsigned SQLite types so it was difficult to determine if the -1 indicated an error. Expect these values to return empty JSON strings in logs. Eventually table implementation will be able to explicitly return a `null` type, which will propagate into JSON.

### Bug fixes:

#1888 OS X's process table would generate a result row for 'fake' pids if a pid was used in the query constraint
#1893 libdevmapper is now built and linked statically for CentOS6/7 packages
#1913 Process 'state' on Linux and OS X was overloaded and typed incorrectly

#1850 String parsing, tokenization, and UTF8 conversions methods have been removed from the public API.
#1858 SQLite has been bumped to 3.11.0, this adds support for `LIKE` within query constraints.

### SQLite 3.11.0 and `LIKE`

The bump to 3.11.0 (#1858) and support for `LIKE` has induced a breaking table spec API change. The `pattern` column has been removed from `file` and `yara` as it was used has a small hack to support `LIKE`-style operations.

Prior to osquery 1.7.1 a query would use:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM file WHERE pattern = '/etc/%';
```

Now you must use the more natural:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM file WHERE path LIKE '/etc/%';
```

### Notes:

#1829 Adds significant hardening around dispatcher / extension thread safety for the osquery core. An equivalent study is yet to be committed for extension processes.
#1831 Thrift 0.9.3 is now required to build-- packages prior to 1.7.1 used 0.9.1.

### Notes:

The OS X `signature` table now only reports success if the target path passes 'strict' code signing checks.
This release marks the first release build built using 10.11, and the TLS implementation uses LibreSSL.
For a short period between 1.6.3 and 1.6.4 the RocksDB options were not compatible with previous databases. There are no compatibility issues with 1.7.0 and previous releases.

This release introduces schedule caching, greatly improving performance when using default packs.
The `getQueryColumns` thrift API now uses heuristics to determine expression types.
OS X's `hardware_events` table is now backed by an IOKit eventing API (previously it only included HID events).
Constraints stacking within subqueries is improved (part 4 of #1651).

Tables that act on user data (on Linux) have been refactored to require a `JOIN` against `users` to enumerate. There are still several tables on OS X that search user-owned directories, they will eventually be refactored too. In all cases, the pack queries operating on these tables have been updated to include `JOIN users USING (uid)`.

### Bug fixes:

#1527 Building from source is no longer required for profiling with `./tools/profile.py`
#1635 Dropping privileges temporarily on Linux would cause thrift sockets to close
#1675 Constraints ""stacked"" onto the same table would overwrite subquery constraints
#1685 OS X's LaunchDaemon's ProgramArguments rewrite `argv[0]` and could trample status log filenames
