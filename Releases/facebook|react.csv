**Learn more in the [React 16.0 announcement post](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html)!**

----

### New JS Environment Requirements

 * React 16 depends on the collection types [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) and [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set), as well as [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame). If you support older browsers and devices which may not yet provide these natively (e.g. <IE11), [you may want to include a polyfill](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/9a4d54653ae9c50af6c54b4e0e56b583).

### New Features
* Components can now return arrays and strings from `render`. (Docs coming soon!)
* Improved error handling with introduction of ""error boundaries"". [Error boundaries](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html) are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
* First-class support for declaratively rendering a subtree into another DOM node with `ReactDOM.createPortal()`. (Docs coming soon!)
* Streaming mode for server side rendering is enabled with `ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticNodeStream()`. ([@aickin](https://github.com/aickin) in [#10425](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10425), [#10044](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10044), [#10039](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10039), [#10024](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10024), [#9264](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9264), and others.)
* [React DOM now allows passing non-standard attributes](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/09/08/dom-attributes-in-react-16.html). ([@nhunzaker](https://github.com/nhunzaker) in [#10385](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10385), [10564](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10564), [#10495](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10495) and others)

### Breaking Changes
- There are several changes to the behavior of scheduling and lifecycle methods:
  * `ReactDOM.render()` and `ReactDOM.unstable_renderIntoContainer()` now return `null` if called from inside a lifecycle method.
    * To work around this, you can either use [the new portal API](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10309#issuecomment-318433235) or [refs](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10309#issuecomment-318434635).
  * Minor changes to `setState` behavior:
    * Calling `setState` with null no longer triggers an update. This allows you to decide in an updater function if you want to re-render.
    * Calling `setState` directly in render always causes an update. This was not previously the case. Regardless, you should not be calling `setState` from render.
    * `setState` callback (second argument) now fires immediately after `componentDidMount` / `componentDidUpdate` instead of after all components have rendered.
  * When replacing `<A />` with `<B />`,  `B.componentWillMount` now always happens before  `A.componentWillUnmount`. Previously, `A.componentWillUnmount` could fire first in some cases.
  * Previously, changing the `ref` to a component would always detach the ref before that component's render is called. Now, we change the `ref` later, when applying the changes to the DOM.
  * It is not safe to re-render into a container that was modified by something other than React. This worked previously in some cases but was never supported. We now emit a warning in this case. Instead you should clean up your component trees using `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode`. [See this example.](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10294#issuecomment-318820987)
  * `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle no longer receives `prevContext` param. ([@bvaughn](https://github.com/bvaughn) in [#8631](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8631))
  * Non-unique keys may now cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted. Using non-unique keys is not (and has never been) supported, but previously it was a hard error.
  * Shallow renderer no longer calls `componentDidUpdate()` because DOM refs are not available. This also makes it consistent with `componentDidMount()` (which does not get called in previous versions either).
  * Shallow renderer does not implement `unstable_batchedUpdates()` anymore.
  * `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates` now only takes one extra argument after the callback.
- The names and paths to the single-file browser builds have changed to emphasize the difference between development and production builds. For example:
  - `react/dist/react.js` → `react/umd/react.development.js`
  - `react/dist/react.min.js` → `react/umd/react.production.min.js`
  - `react-dom/dist/react-dom.js` → `react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js`
  - `react-dom/dist/react-dom.min.js` → `react-dom/umd/react-dom.production.min.js`
* The server renderer has been completely rewritten, with some improvements:
  * Server rendering does not use markup validation anymore, and instead tries its best to attach to existing DOM, warning about inconsistencies. It also doesn't use comments for empty components and data-reactid attributes on each node anymore.
  * Hydrating a server rendered container now has an explicit API. Use `ReactDOM.hydrate` instead of `ReactDOM.render` if you're reviving server rendered HTML. Keep using `ReactDOM.render` if you're just doing client-side rendering.
* When ""unknown"" props are passed to DOM components, for valid values, React will now render them in the DOM. [See this post for more details.](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/09/08/dom-attributes-in-react-16.html) ([@nhunzaker](https://github.com/nhunzaker) in [#10385](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10385), [10564](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10564), [#10495](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10495) and others)
* Errors in the render and lifecycle methods now unmount the component tree by default. To prevent this, add [error boundaries](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html) to the appropriate places in the UI.

### Removed Deprecations

- There is no `react-with-addons.js` build anymore. All compatible addons are published separately on npm, and have single-file browser versions if you need them.
- The deprecations introduced in 15.x have been removed from the core package. `React.createClass` is now available as create-react-class, `React.PropTypes` as prop-types, `React.DOM` as react-dom-factories, react-addons-test-utils as react-dom/test-utils, and shallow renderer as react-test-renderer/shallow. See [15.5.0](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/04/07/react-v15.5.0.html) and [15.6.0](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/06/13/react-v15.6.0.html) blog posts for instructions on migrating code and automated codemods.",https://api.github.com/users/acdlite,3624098,acdlite,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/releases/7897724/assets,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/releases/7897724,master,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/tarball/v16.0.0,https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v16.0.0,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/zipball/v16.0.0,v16.0.0,False,False

2982082,2016-04-08T15:36:13Z,2016-04-08T16:05:25Z,v15.0.0,"### Major changes
- **Initial render now uses `document.createElement` instead of generating HTML.** Previously we would generate a large string of HTML and then set `node.innerHTML`. At the time, this was decided to be faster than using `document.createElement` for the majority of cases and browsers that we supported. Browsers have continued to improve and so overwhelmingly this is no longer true. By using `createElement` we can make other parts of React faster. ([@spicyj](https://github.com/spicyj) in [#5205](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5205))
- **`data-reactid` is no longer on every node.** As a result of using `document.createElement`, we can prime the node cache as we create DOM nodes, allowing us to skip a potential lookup (which used the `data-reactid` attribute). Root nodes will have a `data-reactroot` attribute and server generated markup will still contain `data-reactid`. ([@spicyj](https://github.com/spicyj) in [#5205](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5205))
- **No more extra `<span>`s.** ReactDOM will now render plain text nodes interspersed with comment nodes that are used for demarcation. This gives us the same ability to update individual pieces of text, without creating extra nested nodes. If you were targeting these `<span>`s in your CSS, you will need to adjust accordingly. You can always render them explicitly in your components. ([@mwiencek](https://github.com/mwiencek) in [#5753](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5753))
- **Rendering `null` now uses comment nodes.** Previously `null` would render to `<noscript>` elements. We now use comment nodes. This may cause issues if making use of `:nth-child` CSS selectors. While we consider this rendering behavior an implementation detail of React, it's worth noting the potential problem. ()[@spicyj](https://github.com/spicyj) in [#5451](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5451))
- **Functional components can now return `null`.** We added support for [defining stateless components as functions](/react/blog/2015/09/10/react-v0.14-rc1.html#stateless-function-components) in React 0.14. However, React 0.14 still allowed you to define a class component without extending `React.Component` or using `React.createClass()`, so [we couldn’t reliably tell if your component is a function or a class](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5355), and did not allow returning `null` from it. This issue is solved in React 15, and you can now return `null` from any component, whether it is a class or a function. ([@jimfb](https://github.com/jimfb) in [#5884](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5884))
- **Improved SVG support.** All SVG tags are now fully supported. (Uncommon SVG tags are not present on the `React.DOM` element helper, but JSX and `React.createElement` work on all tag names.) All SVG attributes that are implemented by the browsers should be supported too. If you find any attributes that we have missed, please [let us know in this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1657). ([@zpao](https://github.com/zpao) in [#6243](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6243))

### Breaking changes
- **No more extra `<span>`s.**
- **`React.cloneElement()` now resolves `defaultProps`.** We fixed a bug in `React.cloneElement()` that some components may rely on. If some of the `props` received by `cloneElement()` are `undefined`, it used to return an element with `undefined` values for those props. We’re changing it to be consistent with `createElement()`. Now any `undefined` props passed to `cloneElement()` are resolved to the corresponding component’s `defaultProps`. ([@truongduy134](https://github.com/truongduy134) in [#5997](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5997))
- **`ReactPerf.getLastMeasurements()` is opaque.** This change won’t affect applications but may break some third-party tools. We are [revamping `ReactPerf` implementation](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6046) and plan to release it during the 15.x cycle. The internal performance measurement format is subject to change so, for the time being, we consider the return value of `ReactPerf.getLastMeasurements()` an opaque data structure that should not be relied upon. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#6286](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6286))

#### Removed deprecations

These deprecations were introduced nine months ago in v0.14 with a warning and are removed:
- Deprecated APIs are removed from the `React` top-level export: `findDOMNode`, `render`, `renderToString`, `renderToStaticMarkup`, and `unmountComponentAtNode`. As a reminder, they are now available on `ReactDOM` and `ReactDOMServer`. ([@jimfb](https://github.com/jimfb) in [#5832](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5832))
- Deprecated addons are removed: `batchedUpdates` and `cloneWithProps`. ([@jimfb](https://github.com/jimfb) in [#5859](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5859), [@zpao](https://github.com/zpao) in [#6016](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6016))
- Deprecated component instance methods are removed: `setProps`, `replaceProps`, and `getDOMNode`. ([@jimfb](https://github.com/jimfb) in [#5570](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5570))
- Deprecated CommonJS `react/addons` entry point is removed. As a reminder, you should use separate `react-addons-*` packages instead. This only applies if you use the CommonJS builds. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#6285](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6285))
- Passing `children` to void elements like `<input>` was deprecated, and now throws an error. ([@jonhester](https://github.com/jonhester) in [#3372](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/3372))
- React-specific properties on DOM `refs` (e.g. `this.refs.div.props`) were deprecated, and are removed now. ([@jimfb](https://github.com/jimfb) in [#5495](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5495))

### New deprecations, introduced with a warning

Each of these changes will continue to work as before with a new warning until the release of React 16 so you can upgrade your code gradually.
- `LinkedStateMixin` and `valueLink` are now deprecated due to very low popularity. If you need this, you can use a wrapper component that implements the same behavior: [react-linked-input](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-linked-input). ([@jimfb](https://github.com/jimfb) in [#6127](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6127))
- Future versions of React will treat `<input value={null}>` as a request to clear the input. However, React 0.14 has been ignoring `value={null}`. React 15 warns you on a `null` input value and offers you to clarify your intention. To fix the warning, you may explicitly pass an empty string to clear a controlled input, or pass `undefined` to make the input uncontrolled. ([@antoaravinth](https://github.com/antoaravinth) in [#5048](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5048))
- `ReactPerf.printDOM()` was renamed to `ReactPerf.printOperations()`, and `ReactPerf.getMeasurementsSummaryMap()` was renamed to `ReactPerf.getWasted()`. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#6287](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6287))

### New helpful warnings
- If you use a minified copy of the _development_ build, React DOM kindly encourages you to use the faster production build instead. ([@spicyj](https://github.com/spicyj) in [#5083](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5083))
- React DOM: When specifying a unit-less CSS value as a string, a future version will not add `px` automatically. This version now warns in this case (ex: writing `style={{'{{'}}width: '300'}}`. Unitless _number_ values like `width: 300` are unchanged. ([@pluma](https://github.com/pluma) in [#5140](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5140))
- Synthetic Events will now warn when setting and accessing properties (which will not get cleared appropriately), as well as warn on access after an event has been returned to the pool. ([@kentcdodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds) in [#5940](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5940) and [@koba04](https://github.com/koba04) in [#5947](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5947))
- Elements will now warn when attempting to read `ref` and `key` from the props. ([@prometheansacrifice](https://github.com/prometheansacrifice) in [#5744](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5744))
- React will now warn if you pass a different `props` object to `super()` in the constructor. ([@prometheansacrifice](https://github.com/prometheansacrifice) in [#5346](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5346))
- React will now warn if you call `setState()` inside `getChildContext()`. ([@raineroviir](https://github.com/raineroviir) in [#6121](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6121))
- React DOM now attempts to warn for mistyped event handlers on DOM elements, such as `onclick` which should be `onClick`. ([@ali](https://github.com/ali) in [#5361](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5361))
- React DOM now warns about `NaN` values in `style`. ([@jontewks](https://github.com/jontewks) in [#5811](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5811))
- React DOM now warns if you specify both `value` and `defaultValue` for an input. ([@mgmcdermott](https://github.com/mgmcdermott) in [#5823](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5823))
- React DOM now warns if an input switches between being controlled and uncontrolled. ([@TheBlasfem](https://github.com/TheBlasfem) in [#5864](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5864))
- React DOM now warns if you specify `onFocusIn` or `onFocusOut` handlers as they are unnecessary in React. ([@jontewks](https://github.com/jontewks) in [#6296](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6296))
- React now prints a descriptive error message when you pass an invalid callback as the last argument to `ReactDOM.render()`, `this.setState()`, or `this.forceUpdate()`. ([@conorhastings](https://github.com/conorhastings) in [#5193](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5193) and [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) in [#6310](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6310))
- Add-Ons: `TestUtils.Simulate()` now prints a helpful message if you attempt to use it with shallow rendering. ([@conorhastings](https://github.com/conorhastings) in [#5358](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5358))
- PropTypes: `arrayOf()` and `objectOf()` provide better error messages for invalid arguments. ([@chicoxyzzy](https://github.com/chicoxyzzy) in [#5390](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5390))

### Notable bug fixes
- Fixed multiple small memory leaks. ([@spicyj](https://github.com/spicyj) in [#4983](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4983) and [@victor-homyakov](https://github.com/victor-homyakov) in [#6309](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6309))
- Input events are handled more reliably in IE 10 and IE 11; spurious events no longer fire when using a placeholder. ([@jquense](https://github.com/jquense) in [#4051](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4051))
- The `componentWillReceiveProps()` lifecycle method is now consistently called when `context` changes. ([@milesj](https://github.com/milesj) in [#5787](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5787))
- `React.cloneElement()` doesn’t append slash to an existing `key` when used inside `React.Children.map()`. ([@ianobermiller](https://github.com/ianobermiller) in [#5892](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5892))
- React DOM now supports the `cite` and `profile` HTML attributes. ([@AprilArcus](https://github.com/AprilArcus) in [#6094](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6094) and [@saiichihashimoto](https://github.com/saiichihashimoto) in [#6032](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6032))
- React DOM now supports `cssFloat`, `gridRow` and `gridColumn` CSS properties. ([@stevenvachon](https://github.com/stevenvachon) in [#6133](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6133) and  [@mnordick](https://github.com/mnordick) in [#4779](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4779))
- React DOM now correctly handles `borderImageOutset`, `borderImageWidth`, `borderImageSlice`, `floodOpacity`, `strokeDasharray`, and `strokeMiterlimit` as unitless CSS properties. ([@rofrischmann](https://github.com/rofrischmann) in [#6210](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6210) and [#6270](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6270))
- React DOM now supports the `onAnimationStart`, `onAnimationEnd`, `onAnimationIteration`, `onTransitionEnd`, and `onInvalid` events. Support for `onLoad` has been added to `object` elements. ([@tomduncalf](https://github.com/tomduncalf) in [#5187](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5187),  [@milesj](https://github.com/milesj) in [#6005](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6005), and [@ara4n](https://github.com/ara4n) in [#5781](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5781))
- React DOM now defaults to using DOM attributes instead of properties, which fixes a few edge case bugs. Additionally the nullification of values (ex: `href={null}`) now results in the forceful removal, no longer trying to set to the default value used by browsers in the absence of a value. ([@syranide](https://github.com/syranide) in [#1510](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/1510))
- React DOM does not mistakingly coerce `children` to strings for Web Components. ([@jimfb](https://github.com/jimfb) in [#5093](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5093))
- React DOM now correctly normalizes SVG `<use>` events. ([@edmellum](https://github.com/edmellum) in [#5720](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5720))
- React DOM does not throw if a `<select>` is unmounted while its `onChange` handler is executing. ([@sambev](https://github.com/sambev) in [#6028](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6028))
- React DOM does not throw in Windows 8 apps. ([@Andrew8xx8](https://github.com/Andrew8xx8) in [#6063](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6063))
- React DOM does not throw when asynchronously unmounting a child with a `ref`. ([@yiminghe](https://github.com/yiminghe) in [#6095](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6095))
- React DOM no longer forces synchronous layout because of scroll position tracking. ([@syranide](https://github.com/syranide) in [#2271](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/2271))
- `Object.is` is used in a number of places to compare values, which leads to fewer false positives, especially involving `NaN`. In particular, this affects the `shallowCompare` add-on. ([@chicoxyzzy](https://github.com/chicoxyzzy) in [#6132](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6132))
- Add-Ons: ReactPerf no longer instruments adding or removing an event listener because they don’t really touch the DOM due to event delegation. ([@antoaravinth](https://github.com/antoaravinth) in [#5209](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5209))

### Other improvements
- React now uses `loose-envify` instead of `envify` so it installs less transitive dependencies. ([@qerub](https://github.com/qerub) in [#6303](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6303))
- Shallow renderer now exposes `getMountedInstance()`. ([@glenjamin](https://github.com/glenjamin) in [#4918](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4918))
- Shallow renderer now returns the rendered output from `render()`. ([@simonewebdesign](https://github.com/simonewebdesign) in [#5411](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5411))
- React no longer depends on ES5 _shams_ for `Object.create` and `Object.freeze` in older environments. It still, however, requires ES5 _shims_ in those environments. ([@dgreensp](https://github.com/dgreensp) in [#4959](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4959))
- React DOM now allows `data-` attributes with names that start with numbers. ([@nLight](https://github.com/nLight) in [#5216](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5216))
- React DOM adds a new `suppressContentEditableWarning` prop for components like [Draft.js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/) that intentionally manage `contentEditable` children with React. ([@mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr) in [#6112](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6112))
- React improves the performance for `createClass()` on complex specs. ([@spicyj](https://github.com/spicyj) in [#5550](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5550))

#### Breaking Changes
- Deprecated patterns that warned in 0.12 no longer work: most prominently, calling component classes without using JSX or React.createElement and using non-component functions with JSX or createElement
- Mutating `props` after an element is created is deprecated and will cause warnings in development mode; future versions of React will incorporate performance optimizations assuming that props aren't mutated
- Static methods (defined in `statics`) are no longer autobound to the component class
- `ref` resolution order has changed slightly such that a ref to a component is available immediately after its `componentDidMount` method is called; this change should be observable only if your component calls a parent component's callback within your `componentDidMount`, which is an anti-pattern and should be avoided regardless
- Calls to `setState` in life-cycle methods are now always batched and therefore asynchronous. Previously the first call on the first mount was synchronous.
- `setState` and `forceUpdate` on an unmounted component now warns instead of throwing. That avoids a possible race condition with Promises.
- Access to most internal properties has been completely removed, including `this._pendingState` and `this._rootNodeID`.

#### New Features
- Support for using ES6 classes to build React components; see the [v0.13.0 beta 1 notes](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html) for details.
- Added new top-level API `React.findDOMNode(component)`, which should be used in place of `component.getDOMNode()`. The base class for ES6-based components will not have `getDOMNode`. This change will enable some more patterns moving forward.
- Added a new top-level API `React.cloneElement(el, props)` for making copies of React elements – see the [v0.13 RC2 notes](/react/blog/2015/03/03/react-v0.13-rc2.html#react.cloneelement) for more details.
- New `ref` style, allowing a callback to be used in place of a name: `<Photo ref={(c) => this._photo = c} />` allows you to reference the component with `this._photo` (as opposed to `ref=""photo""` which gives `this.refs.photo`).
- `this.setState()` can now take a function as the first argument for transactional state updates, such as `this.setState((state, props) => ({count: state.count + 1}));` – this means that you no longer need to use `this._pendingState`, which is now gone.
- Support for iterators and immutable-js sequences as children.

#### Deprecations
- `ComponentClass.type` is deprecated. Just use `ComponentClass` (usually as `element.type === ComponentClass`).
- Some methods that are available on `createClass`-based components are removed or deprecated from ES6 classes (`getDOMNode`, `replaceState`, `isMounted`, `setProps`, `replaceProps`).

### React with Add-Ons

#### New Features
- [`React.addons.createFragment` was added](/react/docs/create-fragment.html) for adding keys to entire sets of children.

#### Deprecations
- `React.addons.classSet` is now deprecated. This functionality can be replaced with several freely available modules. [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) is one such module.
- Calls to `React.addons.cloneWithProps` can be migrated to use `React.cloneElement` instead – make sure to merge `style` and `className` manually if desired.

### React Tools

#### Breaking Changes
- When transforming ES6 syntax, `class` methods are no longer enumerable by default, which requires `Object.defineProperty`; if you support browsers such as IE8, you can pass `--target es3` to mirror the old behavior

#### New Features
- `--target` option is available on the jsx command, allowing users to specify and ECMAScript version to target.
  - `es5` is the default.
  - `es3` restores the previous default behavior. An additional transform is added here to ensure the use of reserved words as properties is safe (eg `this.static` will become `this['static']` for IE8 compatibility).
- The transform for the call spread operator has also been enabled.

### JSX

#### Breaking Changes
- A change was made to how some JSX was parsed, specifically around the use of `>` or `}` when inside an element. Previously it would be treated as a string but now it will be treated as a parse error. The [`jsx_orphaned_brackets_transformer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsx_orphaned_brackets_transformer) package on npm can be used to find and fix potential issues in your JSX code.

#### Breaking Changes
- `key` and `ref` moved off props object, now accessible on the element directly
- React is now BSD licensed with accompanying Patents grant
- Default prop resolution has moved to Element creation time instead of mount time, making them effectively static
- `React.__internals` is removed - it was exposed for DevTools which no longer needs access

- Added support for namespaces, eg `<Components.Checkbox />`
- JSXTransformer
  - Enable the same `harmony` features available in the command line with `<script type=""text/jsx;harmony=true"">`
  - Scripts are downloaded in parallel for more speed. They are still executed in order (as you would expect with normal script tags)
  - Fixed a bug preventing sourcemaps from working in Firefox

### React Tools Module
- Improved readme with usage and API information
- Improved ES6 transforms available with `--harmony` option
- Added `--source-map-inline` option to the `jsx` executable
- New `transformWithDetails` API which gives access to the raw sourcemap data

#### New Features
- Added warnings to help migrate towards descriptors
- Made it possible to server render without React-related markup (`data-reactid`, `data-react-checksum`). This DOM will not be mountable by React. [Read the docs for `React.renderComponentToStaticMarkup`](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.rendercomponenttostaticmarkup)
- Added support for more attributes:
  - `srcSet` for `<img>` to specify images at different pixel ratios
  - `textAnchor` for SVG

#### Bug Fixes
- Ensure all void elements don’t insert a closing tag into the markup.
- Ensure `className={false}` behaves consistently
- Ensure `this.refs` is defined, even if no refs are specified.

### Addons
- `update` function to deal with immutable data. [Read the docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/update.html)

### react-tools
- Added an option argument to `transform` function. The only option supported is `harmony`, which behaves the same as `jsx --harmony` on the command line. This uses the ES6 transforms from [jstransform](https://github.com/facebook/jstransform).

193010,2014-02-20T06:50:30Z,2014-03-04T23:10:29Z,v0.9.0,"## What’s New?

This version includes better support for normalizing event properties across all supported browsers so that you need to worry even less about cross-browser differences. We've also made many improvements to error messages and have refactored the core to never rethrow errors, so stack traces are more accurate and Chrome's purple break-on-error stop sign now works properly.

We've also added to the add-ons build [React.addons.TestUtils](/react/docs/test-utils.html), a set of new utilities to help you write unit tests for React components. You can now simulate events on your components, and several helpers are provided to help make assertions about the rendered DOM tree.

We've also made several other improvements and a few breaking changes; the full changelog is provided below.

## JSX Whitespace

In addition to the changes to React core listed below, we've made a small change to the way JSX interprets whitespace to make things more consistent. With this release, space between two components on the same line will be preserved, while a newline separating a text node from a tag will be eliminated in the output. Consider the code:

``` html
<div>
  Monkeys:
  {listOfMonkeys} {submitButton}
</div>
```

In v0.8 and below, it was transformed to the following:

``` javascript
React.DOM.div(null,
  "" Monkeys: "",
  listOfMonkeys, submitButton
)
```

In v0.9, it will be transformed to this JS instead:

``` javascript{2,3}
React.DOM.div(null,
  ""Monkeys:"",
  listOfMonkeys, "" "", submitButton
)
```

We believe this new behavior is more helpful and elimates cases where unwanted whitespace was previously added.

In cases where you want to preserve the space adjacent to a newline, you can write `{'Monkeys: '}` or `Monkeys:{' '}` in your JSX source. We've included a script to do an automated codemod of your JSX source tree that preserves the old whitespace behavior by adding and removing spaces appropriately. You can [install jsx_whitespace_transformer from npm](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/npm-jsx_whitespace_transformer/README.md) and run it over your source tree to modify files in place. The transformed JSX files will preserve your code's existing whitespace behavior.

## Changelog

### React Core

#### Breaking Changes
- The lifecycle methods `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` no longer receive the root node as a parameter; use `this.getDOMNode()` instead
- Whenever a prop is equal to `undefined`, the default value returned by `getDefaultProps` will now be used instead
- `React.unmountAndReleaseReactRootNode` was previously deprecated and has now been removed
- `React.renderComponentToString` is now synchronous and returns the generated HTML string
- Full-page rendering (that is, rendering the `<html>` tag using React) is now supported only when starting with server-rendered markup
- On mouse wheel events, `deltaY` is no longer negated
- When prop types validation fails, a warning is logged instead of an error thrown (with the production build of React, type checks are now skipped for performance)
- On `input`, `select`, and `textarea` elements, `.getValue()` is no longer supported; use `.getDOMNode().value` instead

#### New Features
- React now never rethrows errors, so stack traces are more accurate and Chrome's purple break-on-error stop sign now works properly
- Added support for SVG tags `defs`, `linearGradient`, `polygon`, `radialGradient`, `stop`
- Added support for more attributes:
  - `crossOrigin` for CORS requests
  - `download` and `hrefLang` for `<a>` tags

- The `autoFocus` attribute is now polyfilled consistently on `input`, `select`, and `textarea`

#### Bug Fixes
- React no longer adds an `__owner__` property to each component's `props` object; passed-in props are now never mutated
- When nesting top-level components (e.g., calling `React.renderComponent` within `componentDidMount`), events now properly bubble to the parent component
- Fixed a case where nesting top-level components would throw an error when updating
- Passing an invalid or misspelled propTypes type now throws an error
- On mouse enter/leave events, `.target`, `.relatedTarget`, and `.type` are now set properly

- Memory usage improvements - reduced allocations in core which will help with GC pauses
- Performance improvements - in addition to speeding things up, we made some tweaks to stay out of slow path code in V8 and Nitro.
- Standardized prop -> DOM attribute process. This previously resulting in additional type checking and overhead as well as confusing cases for users. Now we will always convert your value to a string before inserting it into the DOM.
- Support for Selection events.
- Support for [Composition events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompositionEvent).
- Support for additional DOM properties (`charSet`, `content`, `form`, `httpEquiv`, `rowSpan`, `autoCapitalize`).
- Support for additional SVG properties (`rx`, `ry`).
- Support for using `getInitialState` and `getDefaultProps` in mixins.
- Support mounting into iframes.
- Bug fixes for controlled form components.
- Bug fixes for SVG element creation.
- Added `React.version`.
- Added `React.isValidClass` - Used to determine if a value is a valid component constructor.
- Removed `React.autoBind` - This was deprecated in v0.4 and now properly removed.
- Renamed  `React.unmountAndReleaseReactRootNode` to `React.unmountComponentAtNode`.
- Began laying down work for refined performance analysis.
- Better support for server-side rendering - [react-page](https://github.com/facebook/react-page) has helped improve the stability for server-side rendering.
- Made it possible to use React in environments enforcing a strict [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy). This also makes it possible to use React to build Chrome extensions.

## React with Addons (New!)
- Introduced a separate build with several ""addons"" which we think can help improve the React experience. We plan to deprecate this in the long-term, instead shipping each as standalone pieces. [Read more in the docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/addons.html).

## JSX
- No longer transform `class` to `className` as part of the transform! This is a breaking change - if you were using `class`, you _must_ change this to `className` or your components will be visually broken.
- Added warnings to the in-browser transformer to make it clear it is not intended for production use.
- Improved compatibility for Windows
- Improved support for maintaining line numbers when transforming.

- Switch from using `id` attribute to `data-reactid` to track DOM nodes. This allows you to integrate with other JS and CSS libraries more easily.
- Support for more DOM elements and attributes (e.g., `<canvas>`)
- Improved server-side rendering APIs. `React.renderComponentToString(<component>, callback)` allows you to use React on the server and generate markup which can be sent down to the browser.
- `prop` improvements: validation and default values. [Read our blog post for details...](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/07/11/react-v0-4-prop-validation-and-default-values.html)
- Support for the `key` prop, which allows for finer control over reconciliation. [Read the docs for details...](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html)
- Removed `React.autoBind`. [Read our blog post for details...](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/07/02/react-v0-4-autobind-by-default.html)
- Improvements to forms. We've written wrappers around `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<option>`, and `<select>` in order to standardize many inconsistencies in browser implementations. This includes support for `defaultValue`, and improved implementation of the `onChange` event, and circuit completion. [Read the docs for details...](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html)
- We've implemented an improved synthetic event system that conforms to the W3C spec.
- Updates to your component are batched now, which may result in a significantly faster re-render of components. `this.setState` now takes an optional callback as it's second parameter. If you were using `onClick={this.setState.bind(this, state)}` previously, you'll want to make sure you add a third parameter so that the event is not treated as the callback.

## JSX
- Support for comment nodes `<div>{/* this is a comment and won't be rendered */}</div>`
- Children are now transformed directly into arguments instead of being wrapped in an array
  E.g. `<div><Component1/><Component2/></div>` is transformed into `React.DOM.div(null, Component1(null), Component2(null))`.
  Previously this would be transformed into `React.DOM.div(null, [Component1(null), Component2(null)])`.
  If you were using React without JSX previously, your code should still work.

- Upgraded our dependencies on Commoner and Recast so they use a different directory for their cache.
- Freeze our esprima dependency.

## React
- Allow reusing the same DOM node to render different components. e.g. `React.renderComponent(<div/>, domNode); React.renderComponent(<span/>, domNode);` will work now.
