In the last release, `xctool` only worked with the Xcode version it was compiled with. This was needed due to the massive changes between Xcode 5 and Xcode 6, but caused problems for people using the same `xctool` binary and switching between multiple Xcode versions when building and running their project (happens on CI a bunch).

@ExtremeMan updated `xctool` to make Xcode version-specific functionality happen at runtime. This means an `xctool` compiled with Xcode 6 can build and run tests using Xcode 5, etc.

There is an edge case where compiling `xctool` on Xcode 6 and running it on an app pointed at Xcode 5 will fail if Xcode 6 is located in `/Applications/Xcode.app`. The wrong private framework gets loaded (the framework from Xcode 6 rather than from Xcode 5). If Xcode 6 is saved somewhere like Xcode_6.app then it works.

- Added Xcode 5.1 support.
  - You do not have to update. Xcode 5.0.x is still supported.
- Dropped support for Xcode < 5.0.
- If no `project` or `workspace` is specified, xctool searches in the current directory.
  - This matches xcodebuild semantics.
- Faster OCUnit tests by swizzling the slow implementation of `senIsSuperclassOfClass`.
- Tests that crash will not halt the overall test run
  - This gives you more signal by showing all failing tests in a run rather than stopping at the crash.
- Added `-resetSimulator` option to clear simulator content and settings between test runs.
- Fix for the frequently-reported `Failed to query the list of test cases in the test bundle` bug.
- When selecting an sdk, xctool will now fall back to the major release sdk.
  - For example, if you specify `7.0.3` and it is unavailable xctool falls back to `7.0`.
- OCUnit errors are now reported as test failures.
  - This should fix confusing results like `TEST FAILED: 25 passed, 0 failed, 0 errored, 25 total`
- Testcases in the JUnit reporter now have an `error` attribute.
- The clang analyzer now publishes the `type` and `category` of detected bugs to reporters.

35263,2013-08-29T19:51:57Z,2013-08-29T19:58:49Z,0.1.10,"- Fixed problem preventing some iOS application tests from running (issue #135).  The process to fetch the test cases from the bundle would break if the test bundle depended on symbols provided by the test host / bundle loader.
- Better error reporting when we fail to query the list of test cases in a bundle.

- New reporter system - reporters are now just plain executables that read JSON events from stdin and write formatted results to stdout. [(more info)](https://github.com/facebook/xctool#implementing-your-own-reporters)
- Added retry logic around application/simulator test running. (@unixed)
- We now show clang-like code context for failing test assertions and analyzer warnings. (@kcoons)
- You can set the simulator type (iphone, or ipad) to use for running application tests. (@neonichu)
- Helpful error messages when we can't find the specified scheme and it's likely because you're relying on Xcode's _Autocreate Schemes_ feature (@ndfred)

And, more fixes and lots of cleanup from @mokagio, @jonnyyu, @carsonmcdonald, @jesboat, @tomquist, and @fpotter.
