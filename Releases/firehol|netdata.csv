netdata v1.8.0 released.

This release focuses on metrics streaming improvements and containers monitoring.

As always, this netdata is the fastest and the more stable netdata ever! **Update now!**

[To install or update netdata, click here](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/Installation)!


## key streaming improvements

#### bug fix: streaming slaves consuming 100% CPU

netdata, as a slave, was not handling all the error cases properly, resulting in 100% cpu utilization of a single core, under certain conditions. Especially under FreeBSD and macOS slaves, these conditions were always met, so using FreeBSD or macOS as netdata slaves, was completely broken.

#### bug fix: missing alarm notifications on netdata masters

netdata was incorrectly messing cached alarm state data between the alarms of the mirrored hosts, resulting in alarm notifications not dispatched under certain conditions. This was affecting only netdata masters (ie. netdata servers with more than one host databases, with health monitoring enabled). The alarms were generated and were visible at the dashboards, but the notifications were not always sent.

#### bug fix: streamed charts with duplicate names

There was a minor issue with charts that were created with name aliases. When these charts were streamed from netdata slaves to netdata masters, they ended up with duplicate chart names (ie instead of `type.name` they had `type.type.name`).

---

## key containers monitoring improvements

- **Container network interfaces are now moved to the container section** and they are rendered from the container view point (i.e. `sent` = what the container sent) - no more `veth*` garbage on the dashboard.

- The interfaces also appear as `eth0` (or whatever the container sees) and they are inside the container section of the dashboard. netdata maps each `veth*` interface to the right container, using plain `cgroups` features, so this works for all container managers (docker, lxc, etc).

- Eliminated the nested containers shown under certain versions of `lxc`.

- Also, containers and VMs now have summary gauges on the dashboard

---

## key plugins improvements

#### python.d.plugin now supports HTTP keep-alive

netdata now uses `urllib3` (shipped with netdata for both python v2 and v3) for URLService based plugins.

This enables HTTP `keep-alive` on all connections, which allows netdata to have permanent connections to third party web applications.

Fixed by @l2isbad 

---

## compatibility enhancements

- better support for Oracle Linux, by @schindlerd 
- better support for Alpine Linux
- various fixes at the build procedure for macOS
- `fping` can now run as non-root, in static binary netdata packages

## netdata generic enhancements

- netdata can now listen on UNIX domain sockets (`.sock` files). This allows a local web server and netdata to communicate bypassing the network stack (for netdata set `bind to = unix:/path/to/netdata.sock` - this option supports multiple arguments, so netdata can listen to multiple unix sockets and tcp sockets, at the same time).

- netdata was assuming that the JSON representation of a chart would at most be 1024 bytes, and it was generating **corrupted JSON** output when any chart was exceeding that limit. Removed the limitation (ie. now there is no limit).

- netdata was crashing while starting, if **no usable disks were found**.

- systemd `netdata.service` now allows setting negative netdata OOM score and restarts netdata if it crashes. The new `netdata.service` is not automatically installed when updating netdata. Either delete `/etc/systemd/system/netdata.service` and then update/re-install netdata, or copy the file by hand.

- minor fixes at the installer, by @vincele

---

## new plugins

- Added Intel CPU temperature charts on FreeBSD and macOS, by @vlvkobal 
- Added CPU thermal throttling charts on Linux (useful on physical servers and possibly laptops)
- Added `chrony` plugin, by @domschl
- Added [Stiebel Eltron](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/blob/master/node.d/README.md#stiebel-eltron) plugin to collect metrics from heat pumps and hot water installations from Stiebel Eltron ISG @BrainDoctor

## improved plugins

- `web_log` bugfixes, enhancements and optimizations (including `squid` logs), by @l2isbad 
- `web_log` now enables parsing HTTP/2 logs in `custom_log_format`, by @Funzinator
- `redis` bugfixes, by @l2isbad 
- `haproxy` bugfixes, by @l2isbad 
- `elasticsearch` bugfixes and optimizations, by @l2isbad 
- `rabbitmq` bugfixes and optimizations, by @l2isbad 
- `mdstat` bugfixes, by @JeffHenson
- `tomcat` improvements, by @Wing924
- `mysql` improvements, by @alibo and @l2isbad 
- `dovecot` improvements
- `postgres` improvements, by @facetoe
- `cpufreq` fixed a bug that prevented `accurate` reporting of CPU frequencies. `accurate` works with the `acpi-cpufreq` driver and calculates the average CPU clock of the CPUs utilizing the accounting per frequency, as reported by the kernel, by @tycho
- `cpuidle` performance improvements (faster under load) by @tycho 
- `fail2ban` bugfixes, by @l2isbad 
- `SNMP` plugin new uses latest `net-snmp` and the corrupted 64 bit counters encountered under certain node.js version is now fixed.

---

## dashboard improvements

- `easypiecharts` and `gauges` can now render arbitrary ranges and animate clock wise or counter clock wise.

- traditionally netdata was using 1024 bits = 1 kilobit. It is fixed: 1000 bits = 1 kilobit.

- netdata charts should now work on wordpress pages.

---

## alarms and notifications

- `alarm-notify.sh` now supports debug mode, showing the exact commands it runs to send notifications, when `export NETDATA_ALARM_NOTIFY_DEBUG=1`

- `alarm-notify.sh` now supports setting the sender email address of the emails it sends.

- emails sent by `alarm-notify.sh` now include headers to reduce the possibility of them being scored as spam, by @Ferroin 

- network related alarms got new thresholds and improved badges

- netdata now detects if the system has been suspended and pauses all alarms for 60 seconds on resume, to prevent false alarms (no more false alarms on laptops when they resume).

- netdata alarms now support filtering based on hostname and O/S (linux, freebsd, macos). This means that netdata masters, can now support alarms for slaves of any O/S (i.e. a Linux netdata master can handle alarms for a FreeBSD slave).

- netdata slack notifications now show the host sent the alarm. In the image below, the alarm is about `bangalore`, and is sent by `netdata-build-server` (at the lower left corner):

---

## statsd

- the number of fractional points supported by statsd is now configurable (1 to 7).
- 95th percentile calculation on statsd histograms and timers, was incorrectly averaging the values. It is now fixed.
- statsd metrics with non ASCII text were processed by the statsd server, but were breaking JSON data generated by netdata. Fixed it by replacing all invalid characters.

This is release v1.7 of netdata.

netdata is still spreading fast: we are at **320.000 users** and **132.000 servers**! Almost 100k new users, 52k new installations and 800k docker pulls since the previous release 4 and a half months ago! netdata user base grows at about **1000 new users and 600 new servers _per day_**! Thank you! You are awesome!

> The next release (v1.8) will be focused on providing a **global health monitoring service**, for all netdata users, **for free**! Read more about it [here](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/issues/2466). We need supporters for this cause. Join us!

### highlights of netdata v1.7

1. netdata is now a (very fast) fully featured **statsd** server and the only one with automatic visualization: push a statsd metric and hit F5 on the netdata dashboard: your metric visualized. It also supports synthetic charts, defined by you, so that you can correlate and visualize your application the way you like it.

2. netdata got **new installation options** - it is now [easier than ever to install netdata](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/Installation#linux-one-liner) - we also distribute a **[statically linked netdata x86_64 binary](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/Installation#x86_64-pre-built-binary-for-any-linux)**, including key dependencies (like `bash`, `curl`, etc) that can run everywhere a Linux kernel runs (CoreOS, CirrOS, etc).

3. **metrics streaming and replication** has been improved significantly. All known issues have been solved and key enhancements have been added. headless collectors and proxies can now send metrics to backends when `data source = as collected`.

4. **backends** have got quite a few enhancements, including **host tags**, **metrics filtering**  at the netdata side and sending of chart and dimension names instread of IDs; **[prometheus](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/Using-Netdata-with-Prometheus)** support has been re-written to utilize more prometheus features and provide more flexibility and integration options. **IF YOU UPDATE FROM NETDATA 1.6 PLEASE CHECK YOUR DASHBOARDS, SINCE MANY METRICS HAVE CHANGED NAMES**.

5. netdata now monitors **ZFS** (on Linux and FreeBSD), **ElasticSearch**, **RabbitMQ**, **Go** applications (via `expvar`), **ipfw** (on FreeBSD 11), **samba**, **squid logs** (with `web_log` plugin!).

6. netdata **dashboard loading times** have been improved significantly (hit F5 a few times on a netdata dashboard - it is now amazingly fast), to support dashboards with thousands of charts.

7. netdata alarms now support [custom hooks](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/blob/e980060b2d0724a6ea220a7a1005e2fd094db3ec/conf.d/health_alarm_notify.conf#L318-L365), so you can run whatever you like in parallel with netdata alarms.

8. As usual, this release brings dozens more improvements, enhancements and compatibility fixes.


## netdata is now a fully featured **statsd** server

netdata is now a fully featured **statsd** server. It can collect statsd formatted metrics, visualize them on its dashboards, stream them to other netdata servers or archive them to backend time-series databases.

netdata statsd is fast. It can collect more than 1.200.000 metrics per second on modern hardware, more than 200Mbps of sustained statsd traffic. netdata statsd is inside netdata. This provides a distributed statsd implementation.

netdata also supports statsd **synthetic charts**: You can create dedicated sections on the dashboard to render the charts. You can control everything: the main menu, the submenus, the charts, the dimensions on each chart, etc.

#### counters

- Scope: **count the events of something** (e.g. number of file downloads)
- Format: `name:INTEGER|c` or `name:INTEGER|C` or `name|c`
- statsd increments the counter by the `INTEGER` number supplied (positive, or negative).

## dashboard improvements

There have been significant optimizations to the loading times of the dashboard. The dashboard loads instantly now, even when there are several hundreds of charts in it (hit F5 on the dashboard - it is super fast).

For those who know: we eliminated most browser reflows, by refactoring the way the charts are initialized and splitting initialization in 2 phases. Unfortunately we had to re-shape gauge and easypiecharts, so pay some attention to your custom dashboards after updating.

We now use **natural sorting** on the dashboard elements (i.e. instead of 1, 10, 2, 3 we get 1, 2, 3, 10).

There have been dozens of performance improvements on the netdata dashboard. Like all the previous releases, **this release makes netdata the fastest netdata** so far!

## new installation methods

- Single line installation on Linux
- Static 64bit packages for Linux
- Improved support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux @racciari, 
- Improved support for Amazon Machine Image
- Improved support for Centos @n0coast
- Many more installer/updater improvements @nielsAD, @mfurlend

## Streaming

- improved self cleanup of obsolete charts and hosts at a central netdata.
- **host tags** are now propagated from netdata to netdata while streaming metrics.
- log error when multiple clients are streaming the metrics of the same host.
- dozens more streaming improvements and bugfixes.

## Backends

- New **[prometheus](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/Using-Netdata-with-Prometheus)** backend, supporting all the features of the others backends netdata supports. The new format changed the names of metrics, so if you use grafana or other tools you will have to update your queries.
- Prometheus and opentsdb now support **host tags** (advanced ephemeral nodes monitoring)
- Metrics sent to backends with data source `average`, `sum` or `volume` (from the netdata database) are now more accurate.
- Added `contrib/nc-backend.sh`, a script that can act as a fallback backend for graphite, opentsdb and compatibles.
- netdata nodes without a database (slaves and proxies) can now send `as collected` metrics to backends.

</p>

## Central netdata is here!

This is the first release that supports real-time streaming of metrics between netdata servers.

netdata can now be:

- **autonomous host monitoring** (like it always has been)
- **headless data collector** (collect and stream metrics in real-time to another netdata)
- **headless proxy** (collect metrics from multiple netdata and stream them to another netdata)
- **store and forward proxy** (like **headless proxy**, but with a local database)
- **central database** (metrics from multiple hosts are aggregated)

metrics databases can be configured on all nodes and each node maintaining a database may have a **different retention** policy and possibly run (even different) **alarms** on them.

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2662304/23629551/bb1fd9c2-02c0-11e7-90f5-cab5a3ed4c53.png""/>
</p>

There are 4 settings that control what netdata can be:

1. `[global].memory mode` in `netdata.conf`, controls if a netdata will maintain a **local database** and the type of it. For more information check [Running a dedicated central netdata server](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/Memory-Requirements#running-a-dedicated-central-netdata-server).

2. `[web].mode` in `netdata.conf`, controls if netdata will **expose its API**, and the type of web server to enable (single or multi-threaded). Check [netdata.conf configuration for streaming](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/Replication-Overview#netdataconf-configuration).

3. `[stream].enabled` in `stream.conf`, controls if netdata will **stream its metrics to another netdata**. Check [stream.conf for sending metrics](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/Replication-Overview#streaming-configuration).

4. `[API KEY].enabled` in `stream.conf`, controls if netdata will **accept metrics from other netdata**. Check [stream.conf for receiving metrics](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/Replication-Overview#options-for-the-receiving-node).

Using the above, we support a lot of different configurations, like these:

target | memory<br/>mode | web<br/>mode | stream<br/>enabled | send to<br/>backend | local<br/>alarms | local<br/>dashboard
-------|:-----------:|:---:|:------:|:-------:|:---------:|:----:
**headless collector**|`none`|`none`|`yes`|not possible|not possible|no
**headless proxy**|`none`|not `none`|`yes`|not possible|not possible|no
**proxy with db**|not `none`|not `none`|`yes`|possible|possible|yes
**central netdata**|not `none`|not `none`|`no`|possible|possible|yes


### monitoring ephemeral nodes

netdata now supports monitoring autoscaled ephemeral nodes, that are started and stopped on demand (their IP is not known). 

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2662304/23627295/e3569adc-02b8-11e7-9d55-4014bf98c1b3.png""/>
</p>

When the ephemeral nodes start streaming metrics to the central netdata, the central netdata will show register them at `my-netdata` menu on the dashboard, like this:

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2662304/24080824/24cd2d3c-0caf-11e7-909d-a8dd1dbb95d7.png""/>
</p>

You can see this live at [https://build.my-netdata.io](https://build.my-netdata.io) (this server may not always be available for demo).

For more information check: [monitoring ephemeral nodes](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/monitoring-ephemeral-nodes).

### monitoring ephemeral containers and VM guests

netdata now cleans up container, guest VM, network interfaces and mounted disk metrics, disabling automatically their alarms too.

For more information check [monitoring ephemeral containers](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/monitoring-ephemeral-containers).

## apps.plugin ported for FreeBSD

**[Vladimir Kobal](https://github.com/vlvkobal)** has ported `apps.plugin` to FreeBSD.

netdata can now provide `Applications`, `Users` and `User Groups` under FreeBSD too:

Also, the CPU utilization of netdata under FreeBSD, is now a lot less compared to netdata v1.5.

See it live at our **[FreeBSD demo server](http://freebsd.my-netdata.io/#menu_apps)**.

## web_log plugin

[Ilya Mashchenko](https://github.com/l2isbad) has done a wonderful job creating a **unified web log parsing plugin** for all kinds of web server logs. With it, netdata provides real-time performance information and health monitoring alarms for web applications and web sites!

and a lot more, including **alarms**:


alarm|description|minimum<br/>requests|warning|critical
:-------|-------|:------:|:-----:|:------:
`1m_redirects`|The ratio of HTTP redirects (3xx except 304) over all the requests, during the last minute.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>*Detects if the site or the web API is suffering from too many or circular redirects.*<br/>&nbsp;<br/>(i.e. **oops!** *this should not redirect clients to itself*)|120/min|&gt; 20%|&gt; 30%
`1m_bad_requests`|The ratio of HTTP bad requests (4xx) over all the requests, during the last minute.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>*Detects if the site or the web API is receiving too many bad requests, including `404`, not found.*<br/>&nbsp;<br/>(i.e. **oops!** *a few files were not uploaded*)|120/min|&gt; 30%|&gt; 50%
`1m_internal_errors`|The ratio of HTTP internal server errors (5xx), over all the requests, during the last minute.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>*Detects if the site is facing difficulties to serve requests.*<br/>&nbsp;<br/>(i.e. **oops!** *this release crashes too much*)|120/min|&gt; 2%|&gt; 5%

`web_slow`|The average time to respond to requests, over the last 1 minute, compared to the average of last 10 minutes.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>*Detects if the site or the web API is suddenly a lot slower.*<br/>&nbsp;<br/>(i.e. **oops!** *the database is slow again*)|120/min|&gt; 2x|&gt; 4x
`1m_successful`|The ratio of successful HTTP responses (1xx, 2xx, 304) over all the requests, during the last minute.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>*Detects if the site or the web API is performing within limits.*<br/>&nbsp;<br/>(i.e. **oops!** *help us God!*)|120/min|&lt; 85%|&lt; 75%

## backends

netdata can now archive metrics to `JSON` backends (both push, by @lfdominguez, and pull modes).

## IPMI monitoring

netdata now has an IPMI plugin (based on [freeipmi](https://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/)) for monitoring **server hardware**.

The plugin creates (up to) 8 charts, based on the information collected from IPMI:

1. number of sensors by state
2. number of events in SEL
3. Temperatures CELCIUS
4. Temperatures FAHRENHEIT
5. Voltages
6. Currents
7. Power
8. Fans

It also supports alarms (including the number of sensors in **critical** state):

Yet another release that makes netdata the fastest netdata ever!

This is probably the release with the largest changeset so far. A lot of work, by a lot of people made this release possible!

## FreeBSD, MacOS and FreeNAS

**[Vladimir Kobal](https://github.com/vlvkobal)** has done a magnificent work porting netdata to FreeBSD and MacOS.

Everything works:
- cpu and interrupts, memory, disks (performance and space monitoring)
- network interfaces and softnet
- IPv4 and IPv6 metrics
- processes and context switches
- IPC (queues, semaphores, shared memory)
- and of course all the netdata external plugins

**Wow!** Check it live on FreeBSD, at **[https://freebsd.my-netdata.io/](https://freebsd.my-netdata.io/)**

## Backends

netdata supports **[data archiving to backend databases](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/netdata-backends)**:
- Graphite
- OpenTSDB
- Prometheus

and of course all the compatible ones (KairosDB, InfluxDB, Blueflood, etc)

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2662304/20649711/29f182ba-b4ce-11e6-97c8-ab2c0ab59833.png)

With this feature netdata can interface with your existing devops infrastructure and allow you to visualize its metrics with other tools, like grafana.

## Shell Integration

Shell scripts can now query netdata easily!

``` sh
eval ""$(curl -s 'http://localhost:19999/api/v1/allmetrics')""
```

after this command, all the netdata metrics are exposed to shell. Check:

``` sh
# source the metrics
eval ""$(curl -s 'http://localhost:19999/api/v1/allmetrics')""

# let's see if there are variables exposed by netdata for system.cpu
set | grep ""^NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU""

NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_GUEST=0
NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_GUEST_NICE=0
NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_IDLE=95
NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_IOWAIT=0
NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_IRQ=0
NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_NICE=0
NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_SOFTIRQ=0
NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_STEAL=0
NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_SYSTEM=1
NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_USER=4
NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_VISIBLETOTAL=5

# let's see the total cpu utilization of the system
echo ${NETDATA_SYSTEM_CPU_VISIBLETOTAL}
5

# what about alarms?
set | grep ""^NETDATA_ALARM_SYSTEM_SWAP_""
NETDATA_ALARM_SYSTEM_SWAP_RAM_IN_SWAP_STATUS=CRITICAL
NETDATA_ALARM_SYSTEM_SWAP_RAM_IN_SWAP_VALUE=53
NETDATA_ALARM_SYSTEM_SWAP_USED_SWAP_STATUS=CLEAR
NETDATA_ALARM_SYSTEM_SWAP_USED_SWAP_VALUE=51

# let's get the current status of the alarm 'ram in swap'
echo ${NETDATA_ALARM_SYSTEM_SWAP_RAM_IN_SWAP_STATUS}
CRITICAL

# is it fast?
time curl -s 'http://localhost:19999/api/v1/allmetrics' >/dev/null

real  0m0,070s
user  0m0,000s
sys   0m0,007s

# it is...
# 0.07 seconds for curl to be loaded, connect to netdata and fetch the response back...
```

The `_VISIBLETOTAL` variable sums up all the dimensions of each chart.

The format of the variables is:

`NETDATA_${chart_id^^}_${dimension_id^^}=""${value}""`

The `value` is rounded to the closest integer, since shell script cannot process decimal numbers.

## Dashboard Improvements
- dashboard is now faster on firefox, safari, opera, edge (edge is still the slowest)
- dashboard charts legends now have bigger fonts
- SHIFT + mousewheel to zoom charts, works on all browsers
- perfect-scrollbar on the dashboard
- dashboard 4K resolution fixes
- dashboard compatibility fixes for embedding charts in third party web sites
- charts on custom dashboards can have common min/max even if they come from different netdata servers
- alarm log is now saved and loaded back so that the alarm history is available at the dashboard

## Other Improvements
- python.d.plugin has received way to many improvements from many contributors!
- charts.d.plugin can now be forked to support multiple independent instances
- registry has been re-factored to lower its memory requirements (required for the public registry)
- simple patterns in cgroups, disks and alarms
- netdata-installer.sh can now correctly install netdata in containers
- supplied logrotate script compatibility fixes
- spec cleanup                  @breed808
- clocks and timers reworked    @rlefevre

netdata has received a lot more improvements from many more  contributors! (it was really a lot of work to dig into git log to collect all the above, so forgive me if I forgot to mention a few contributions and contributors).

Thank you all!
