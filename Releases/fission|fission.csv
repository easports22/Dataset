# Release notes

Lots of big changes in this release!

Most importantly, the API has changed a lot. We switched to Kubernetes
ThirdPartyResources, and improved various pieces of the API to support
new environments.

The old API was too different from widely used Kubernetes patterns,
and so we decided to fully break compatibility for this release. We're still in
alpha, so you should expect the occasional API breakage; we'll be
better at preserving compatibility once we reach beta.

The CLI is still compatible. Environments are also still compatible --
environment images that worked before continue to work.

We're creating an upgrade tool to help migrate; if you're upgrading
v0.1.0 and can't do a fresh install, wait for the upgrade tool.

We now use Helm for installation instead of a set of YAML files.

The Fission ""controller"" is now stateless.  Fission's etcd deployment
is removed, since Fission stores state in ThirdPartyResources.  Large
function files are stored in a new function storage service, which
uses a persistent volume.

And, we've started a new docs site; for now it's just the installation
and upgrade guides, but we'll be writing more docs soon.
