- Now that iTerm stable is at version 3, the version 2 applescripts no longer apply to the stable branch. shuttle still supports iTerm 2.14. If you still want to use this legacy version you will have to change your iTerm_version setting to legacy. Valid settings are:

`""iTerm_version"": ""legacy"",` targeting iTerm 2.14
`""iTerm_version"": ""stable"",` targeting new versions of iTerm
`""iTerm_version"": ""nightly"",`targeting only the nightly build of iTerm

Please make sure to change your shuttle.JSON file accordingly. For more on this see #181 

# Bug Fixes
- corrected by @mortonfox -- when iTerm startup preferences are set to ""Don't Open Any Windows"" nothing happens #175 .
- corrected by @pluwen shuttle icon contains unwanted artifacts #141 
- Fixed an issue where commas were not getting parsed #173

- added by @keesfransen -- ssh config file parsing only keeps the first alias. This change keeps the menu clean as it only keeps the first argument to `Host` and will allow for hosts defined like:

```
Host prod/host host.prod
    HostName myserver.local
```

# Bug Fixes
- corrected by @mortonfox -- when iTerm stable is running but no windows are open nothing happens.
- iTerm Stable and Terminal apple scripts were not correctly handling events where the app was open but no windows were open.
- Fixed an issue were iTerm Nightly applescripts would not open if a theme was not set.
- Fixed an issue with the URL detection. shuttle checks the command to see if its a URL then opens that URL in the default app. 
  Example: 

```
""cmd"": ""cifs://myServer/c$""
```

Should open the above path in finder. 

# Other Items
- Added the script files that compile the applescript files for inclusion in shuttle.app
