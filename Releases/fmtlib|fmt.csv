6852721,2017-06-27T17:02:24Z,2017-06-27T17:06:02Z,4.0.0,"* Removed old compatibility headers `cppformat/*.h` and CMake options ([#527](https://github.com/pull/527)). Thanks [@maddinat0r (Alex Martin)](https://github.com/maddinat0r).

* Added `string.h` containing `fmt::to_string()` as alternative to `std::to_string()` as well as other string writer functionality (#326 and #441):
  
  ```c++
  #include ""fmt/string.h""
  
  std::string answer = fmt::to_string(42);
  ```
  Thanks to [@glebov-andrey (Andrey Glebov)](https://github.com/glebov-andrey).

* Moved `fmt::printf()` to new `printf.h` header and allowed `%s` as generic specifier (#453), made `%.f` more conformant to regular `printf()` (#490), added custom writer support (#476) and implemented missing custom argument formatting (#339 and #340):
  
  ```c++
  #include ""fmt/printf.h""
  
  // %s format specifier can be used with any argument type.
  fmt::printf(""%s"", 42);
  ```

  ```c++
  #include ""fmt/format.h""
  
  std::vector<double> v = {1.2, 3.4, 5.6};
  // Prints ""(+01.20, +03.40, +05.60)"".

3178119,2016-05-07T16:50:47Z,2016-05-07T17:07:32Z,3.0.0,"- The project has been renamed from C++ Format (cppformat) to fmt for consistency with the used namespace and macro prefix (#307). Library headers are now located in the `fmt` directory:
  
  ``` c++
  #include ""fmt/format.h""
  ```
  
  Including `format.h` from the `cppformat` directory is deprecated but works via a proxy header which will be removed in the next major version.The documentation is now available at [http://fmtlib.net](http://fmtlib.net).
- Added support for [strftime](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/c/strftime)-like [date and time formatting](http://fmtlib.net/3.0.0/api.html#date-and-time-formatting) (#283):
  
  ``` c++
  #include ""fmt/time.h""
  
  std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
  // Prints ""The date is 2016-04-29."" (with the current date)
  fmt::print(""The date is {:%Y-%m-%d}."", *std::localtime(&t));
  ```
- `std::ostream` support including formatting of user-defined types that provide overloaded `operator<<` has been moved to `fmt/ostream.h`:
  
  ``` c++
  #include ""fmt/ostream.h""
  
  class Date {
    int year_, month_, day_;
  public:
    Date(int year, int month, int day) : year_(year), month_(month), day_(day) {}
  
    friend std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &os, const Date &d) {
      return os << d.year_ << '-' << d.month_ << '-' << d.day_;
    }
  };
  
  std::string s = fmt::format(""The date is {}"", Date(2012, 12, 9));
  // s == ""The date is 2012-12-9""
  ```
- Added support for [custom argument formatters](http://fmtlib.net/3.0.0/api.html#argument-formatters) (#235).
- Added support for locale-specific integer formatting with the `n` specifier (#305):
  
  ``` c++
  std::setlocale(LC_ALL, ""en_US.utf8"");
  fmt::print(""cppformat: {:n}\n"", 1234567); // prints 1,234,567
  ```
- Sign is now preserved when formatting an integer with an incorrect `printf` format specifier (#265):
  
  ``` c++
  fmt::printf(""%lld"", -42); // prints -42
  ```
  
  Note that it would be an undefined behavior in `std::printf`.
- Length modifiers such as `ll` are now optional in printf formatting functions and the correct type is determined automatically (#255):
  
  ``` c++
  fmt::printf(""%d"", std::numeric_limits<long long>::max());
  ```
  
  Note that it would be an undefined behavior in `std::printf`.

  Thanks to [@dean0x7d (Dean Moldovan)](https://github.com/dean0x7d).
- [Breaking] Formatting of more than 16 arguments is now supported when using variadic templates (#141). Thanks to [@Shauren](https://github.com/Shauren).
- Runtime width specification (#168):
  
  ``` c++
  fmt::format(""{0:{1}}"", 42, 5); // gives ""   42""
  ```
  
  Thanks to [@jamboree](https://github.com/jamboree).
- [Breaking] Enums are now formatted with an overloaded `std::ostream` insertion operator (`operator<<`) if available (#232).
- [Breaking] Changed default `bool` format to textual, ""true"" or ""false"" (#170):
  
  ``` c++
  fmt::print(""{}"", true); // prints ""true""
  ```
  
  To print `bool` as a number use numeric format specifier such as `d`:
  
  ``` c++
  fmt::print(""{:d}"", true); // prints ""1""
  ```
- `fmt::printf` and `fmt::sprintf` now support formatting of `bool` with the `%s` specifier giving textual output, ""true"" or ""false"" (#223):
  
  ``` c++
  fmt::printf(""%s"", true); // prints ""true""
  ```
  
  Thanks to [@LarsGullik](https://github.com/LarsGullik).

  ``` c++
  fmt::printf(""The date is %s"", Date(2012, 12, 9));
  ```
- [Breaking] The `Buffer` template is now part of the public API and can be used to implement custom memory buffers (#140). Thanks to [@polyvertex (Jean-Charles Lefebvre)](https://github.com/polyvertex).
- [Breaking] Improved compatibility between `BasicStringRef` and [std::experimental::basic_string_view](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/basic_string_view) (#100, #159, #183):
  - Comparison operators now compare string content, not pointers
  - `BasicStringRef::c_str` replaced by `BasicStringRef::data`

593297,2014-10-25T17:27:49Z,2014-10-27T15:36:32Z,0.12.0,"- [Breaking] Improved separation between formatting and buffer management. `Writer` is now a base class that cannot be instantiated directly. The new `MemoryWriter` class implements the default buffer management with small allocations done on stack. So `fmt::Writer` should be replaced with `fmt::MemoryWriter` in variable declarations.
  Old code:
  
  ```
  fmt::Writer w;
  ```
  
  New code: 
  
  ```
  fmt::MemoryWriter w;
  ```
  
  If you pass `fmt::Writer` by reference, you can continue to do so:
  
  ```
  void f(fmt::Writer &w);
  ```
  
  This doesn't affect the formatting API.
- Support for custom memory allocators (https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat/issues/69)
- Formatting functions now accept `signed char` and `unsigned char` strings as arguments (https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat/issues/73):
  
  ```
  auto s = format(""GLSL version: {}"", glGetString(GL_VERSION)); 
  ```
- Reduced code bloat. According to the new [benchmark results](https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat#compile-time-and-code-bloat), cppformat is close to `printf` and by the order of magnitude better than Boost Format in terms of compiled code size.
- Improved appearance of the documentation on mobile by using the [Sphinx Bootstrap theme](http://ryan-roemer.github.io/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/):

405126,2014-07-01T14:19:42Z,2014-07-01T14:23:16Z,0.10.0,"**Improved API**
- All formatting methods are now implemented as variadic functions instead of using `operator<<` for feeding arbitrary arguments into a temporary formatter object. This works both with C++11 where variadic templates are used and with older standards where variadic functions are emulated by providing lightweight wrapper functions defined with the `FMT_VARIADIC` macro. You can use this macro for defining your own portable variadic functions:
  
  ``` c++
  void report_error(const char *format, const fmt::ArgList &args) {
    fmt::print(""Error: {}"");
    fmt::print(format, args);
  }
  FMT_VARIADIC(void, report_error, const char *)
  
  report_error(""file not found: {}"", path);
  ```
  
  Apart from a more natural syntax, this also improves performance as there is no need to construct temporary formatter objects and control arguments' lifetimes. Because the wrapper functions are very ligthweight, this doesn't cause code bloat even in pre-C++11 mode.
- Simplified common case of formatting an `std::string`. Now it requires a single function call:
  
  ``` c++
  std::string s = format(""The answer is {}."", 42);
  ```
  
  Previously it required 2 function calls:
  
  ``` c++
  std::string s = str(Format(""The answer is {}."") << 42);
  ```
  
  Instead of unsafe `c_str` function, `fmt::Writer` should be used directly to bypass creation of `std::string`:
  
  ``` c++
  fmt::Writer w;
  w.write(""The answer is {}."", 42);
  w.c_str();  // returns a C string
  ```
  
  This doesn't do dynamic memory allocation for small strings and is less error prone as the lifetime of the string is the same as for `std::string::c_str` which is well understood (hopefully).
- Improved consistency in naming functions that are a part of the public API. Now all public functions are lowercase following the standard library conventions. Previously it was a combination of lowercase and CapitalizedWords. Issue https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat/issues/50.
- Old functions are marked as deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

**Other Changes**
- Experimental support for printf format specifications (work in progress):
  
  ``` c++
  fmt::printf(""The answer is %d."", 42);
  std::string s = fmt::sprintf(""Look, a %s!"", ""string"");
  ```
- Support for hexadecimal floating point format specifiers `a` and `A`:
  
  ``` c++
  print(""{:a}"", -42.0); // Prints -0x1.5p+5
  print(""{:A}"", -42.0); // Prints -0X1.5P+5
  ```
- CMake option `FMT_SHARED` that specifies whether to build format as a shared library (off by default).

- <code>Writer::Format</code> now has a variadic overload:
  
  <pre>
  Writer out;
  out.Format(""Look, I'm {}!"", ""variadic"");
  </pre>
- For efficiency and consistency with other overloads, variadic overload of the <code>Format</code> function now returns <code>Writer</code> instead of <code>std::string</code>. Use the <code>str</code> function to convert it to <code>std::string</code>:
  
  <pre>
  std::string s = str(Format(""Look, I'm {}!"", ""variadic""));
  </pre>
- Replaced formatter actions with output sinks: <code>NoAction</code> -> <code>NullSink</code>, <code>Write</code> -> <code>FileSink</code>, <code>ColorWriter</code> -> <code>ANSITerminalSink</code>. This improves naming consistency and shouldn't affect client code unless these classes are used directly which should be rarely needed.
- Added <code>ThrowSystemError</code> function that formats a message and throws <code>SystemError</code> containing the formatted message and system-specific error description. For example, the following code
  
  <pre>
  FILE *f = fopen(filename, ""r"");
  if (!f)
      ThrowSystemError(errno, ""Failed to open file '{}'"") &lt;&lt; filename;
  </pre>
  
  will throw <code>SystemError</code> exception with description <code>""Failed to open file '&lt;filename>': No such file or directory""</code> if file doesn't exist.
- Support for AppVeyor continuous integration platform.
- <code>Format</code> now throws <code>SystemError</code> in case of I/O errors.
- Improve test infrastructure. Print functions are now tested by redirecting the output to a pipe.
