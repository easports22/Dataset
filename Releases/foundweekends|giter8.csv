Starting Giter8 0.10.0, all fields have a property named `truthy` to be used in [conditional expressions][conditionals].
`""y""`, `""yes""`, and `""true""` evaluate to `true`; anything else evaluates to `false`.

```
$if(scala212.truthy)$
scalaVersion := ""2.12.3""
$elseif(scala211.truthy)$
scalaVersion := ""2.11.11""
$else$
scalaVersion := ""2.10.6""
$endif$
```

This is the first release since the development is passed on to
[foundweekends](http://www.foundweekends.org/) project.
- We've relicensed Giter8 under Apache v2 license after contacting
  previous contributors and getting their approvals. [#194](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/issues/194)
- Organization name is changed to `org.foundweekends.giter8`.
- The sbt plugins were renamed to `sbt-giter8` and `sbt-giter8-scaffold`.
- Created Pamflet [documentation](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/).

### bug fixes and improvements
- Better error handling when templates do not compile. [#193](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/pull/193) by [@njlg](https://github.com/njlg)
- Supports Git URLs that start with `ssh://`. [#192](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/pull/192) by [@njlg](https://github.com/njlg)
- Fixes sbt-giter8 not expanding dynamic default properties. [#165](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/pull/165) by [@sattvik](https://github.com/sattvik)
- `ls(..)` property is dropped. [#201](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/pull/201) by [@eed3si9n](https://github.com/eed3si9n)

### root layout

Giter8 0.7.0 introduces an _experimental_ layout called _root layout_.
When Giter8 does not find `src/main/g8`, it will simply use the root directory
of the specified Git repository as the template directory.

The `default.properties` file can be placed either at the root directory
or in `project` directory.
This also means that you can no longer include template fields in the files
under `project`, so the application of root layout is pretty limited. [#202](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/pull/202) by [@eed3si9n](https://github.com/eed3si9n)
