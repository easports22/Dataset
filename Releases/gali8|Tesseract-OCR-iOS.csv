- Added ""G8"" prefix to classes.
- Added new NSOperation subclass (`G8RecognitionOperation`) for easily performing recognition asynchronously.
- Added option to set maximum allowed recognition time before Tesseract stops recognition.
- Added ability to fetch thresholded image from Tesseract.
- Added new class for organizing recognition info (`G8RecognizedBlock`).
- Added ability to provide Tesseract with configuration files.
- Added ability to use a custom path prefix for the tessdata folder.
- Added member variables for accessing Tesseract's page layout analysis (orientation, skew, etc.).
- Added member variable for setting image resolution.
- Added ability to clear Tesseract cache to free up memory.
- Added constants for parameters, PSM modes, orientations, iteration levels, and more.
- Added method to fetch hOCR information.
- Added unit tests and testing coverage.
- Updated initializers.
- Removed framework binary from repository.

- CoreImage filters: use <code>[img blackAndWhite];</code> to convert the UIImage to recognize into a RecognizeImageType
- Rect: use <code>[tesseract setRect:CGRectMake(20, 20, 100, 100)]</code> to define the rect where the text must be recognized

- This update fixes the confidence value issue I reported in #56
- fixed the memory leak
- Modified characterBoxes function to return characters in order
- Removed unused lib files
- Added some null checks to fix a bug where no text is recognized
- **Note**: Building the Tesseract OCR Aggregate product will yield a warning about how the Tesseract and Leptonica lib files don't work for the x86_64 architecture. However, everything still works in the simulator for iPhone 5 and lower, as well as on all physical devices. I guess because the libraries work okay with the i386 target.
- New implementation based off the [API examples for tesseract-ocr](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/APIExample#Result_iterator_example)
