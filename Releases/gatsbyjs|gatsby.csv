Now sites/plugins should use `addFieldToNode` for adding fields to nodes created
by other plugins and `addNodeToParent` for adding a new node as a child to
an existing node.

- React Docgen transformer plugin for parsing propType info from React
components #928

### Changed

- Change node format to hide most node-specific fields under an ""internal""
key. Any code referencing `node.type` and others will need changed to

- Use the Relay Modern compiler for extracting GraphQL queries from components.
This allows us to now support components being added to *all* components. This
means you can now write queries next to the views that use them. #912
- Hook for modifying pages #863
- New Drupal source plugin and example site #890
- Detect if a site's plugins have changed and when they do, delete the site
cache as it might now be invalid #927
- New way to make connections between nodes e.g. article --> author #902

### Changed

- Combine transformer and typegen plugins. The distinction between the two
types of plugins has proved somewhat artificial so they were combined. Any
typegen plugins in your `package.json` and `gatsby-config.js` need to be
removed. #918
- Gatsby now garbage collects old nodes. Source plugins should now ""touch""
- nodes that haven't changed #861
- Due to adopting the Relay compiler, GraphQL query template strings need
named ""graphql"" plus must be named. So if previously you wrote:

```js
export const pageQuery = `
{
  allMarkdownMark {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}

```js
export const pageQuery = graphql`
query IndexQuery {

For this latest alpha, I did a almost *[complete refactor of the data layer](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/818/files)* adding [in Redux](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/788) and ideas from event sourcing and *modern build tools like [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/) and [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)* from Facebook and Google respectively.

Now *all data processing is incremental and completely cached*. On booting, Gatsby looks at your data contents to decide if new processing is needed and only processes data that's actually changed. One large site built on 1.0 saw it's bootstrap time *drop from nearly a minute to **under 5 seconds***!

And as part of this work, Gatsby's data system now automatically watches all your data sources for changes and reprocesses data on the fly. Remote or local data, if you change it, the change will be automatically pushed to the development version of your site. This is handy for editing a local markdown file but also a gatsby plugin can be monitoring a remote API for changes and automatically pull down data and update your site when something is updated.

Imagine a small team working on a site with a developer and two people working on content hosted on a CMS. Every time content is updated, the developer sees the changes in near real-time on the development site.

This was the last big piece blocking 1.0.0 from being released. There are a [number of smaller tasks to complete](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/796) but these should be more predictable in scope. There's plenty of smaller tasks to do! Please come help out!

In the latest @iansu added in https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/666 two ways of modifying the “Root” Gatsby React component. A low-level API `replaceDOMRenderer` and high-level one `wrapRootComponent`.

The high-level API is if you want to simply wrap the root component e.g. to add Redux or Mobx to a Gatsby site.

``` jsx
// in your gatsby-browser.js

import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import store from './store'

// This gets returned to Gatsby which then renders the Root component as normal.
exports.wrapRootComponent = Root => {
  return () => (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Root />
    </Provider>
  );
};
```

The low-level API is for completely replacing the DOM rendering e.g. if you want to override the default React Router setup.

``` jsx
// in your gatsby-browser.js
import { applyRouterMiddleware, hashHistory, Router } from 'react-router'

// Change the router to use hashHistory instead of browserHistory
exports.replaceDOMRenderer = ({ routes, defaultShouldUpdateScroll, onUpdate }) => (
    ReactDOM.render(
      <Router
        history={hashHistory}
        routes={routes}
        render={applyRouterMiddleware(useScroll(defaultShouldUpdateScroll))}
        onUpdate={onUpdate}
      />,
      typeof window !== 'undefined' ? document.getElementById('react-mount') : void 0)
)
```

5387820,2017-02-07T20:43:28Z,2017-02-07T20:54:53Z,New browser API to allow overriding of scrolling behavior,"On old skool web sites, browsers maintain your _scroll position_ for you as you navigate between pages and back. So if you scroll down on a page, click to another link, and then click back — your scroll position on the original page will be set to where you were before clicking away.

But as Gatsby turns your website into a single-page-app, this default browser handling of scroll position has to be emulated. For that we use @taion's great library https://github.com/taion/react-router-scroll

In Gatsby's [web-entry.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/lib/utils/web-entry.js) file where React Router is setup and we do React's rendering to DOM, we have a function which determines whether or not to use the remembered scroll position. For the vast majority of websites, the behavior specified there is correct but occasionally you'll be building something special and will want to use different logic.

To enable customizing scroll behavior, @Rusta, in #663, added a new lifecycle API for overriding the default scroll behavior.

Thanks @Rusta!

Supporting ""frontmatter"" in javascript files. This should still be considered experimental but you can now export an object from your JS pages and that data will be available in your templates, other pages, etc.

I added a quick example of how this works on the starter blog
- http://gatsbyjs.github.io/gatsby-starter-blog/2016-12-9-react-component-post/
- https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/commit/e333cb1aadbba2d5053a3b471fa841b29b3187c2

Note that this initial release is still fairly limited at the moment. This only works in js/jsx files and you must export your data using commonjs (e.g. `exports.data = {}`). Also we only parse data layer one level deep so

this works:

``` javascript
exports.data = {
  title: ""My sweet title"",
}
```

this still does not work:

``` javascript
exports.data = {
  title: ""My sweet title"",
  goingDeeper: {
    word: ""to your mother"",
  }
}
```

PRs welcome to make this work on es6 exports (`export const data`) as well as for subobjects!

- Did the intitial build of the new gatsbyjs.org! It's in the `www`
  subdirectory on the 1.0 branch and is built on each push! That's my
  kind of integration testing 😎 You can see the early version of the
  site at https://gatsbyjs.netlify.com/.
- Added `<link preload>` for page JS bundles. This speeds up loading scripts
  slightly by telling the browser to start downloading the scripts when
  the HTML first starts being parsed instead of when the browser reaches
  the end. This is especially helpful for large HTML documents on slow
  mobile networks. [PR](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/558)

## Changed
- Use namedmodulesplugin instead of recordsPath for ensuring
  deterministic builds and long-term cachability. The [previous PR adding
  support for recordsPath](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/533)
  proved unpleasant as you had to build locally and commit the outputted
  records.json which was confusing and annoying.

  <h1>Hi friends!</h1>
  <img src={myImage} />
</div>
```

We're using the [image-webpack-loader](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader) which uses the popular [Imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin) project to minify your images.

There's future (responsive) image work planned! See https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/285 if you want to get involved.

## Upgrade

This is marked as a breaking release as it _could_ interfere with your Webpack config _if_ you already have added image loader support.

If you have added custom image loaders already, to upgrade, in your `modifyWebpackConfig` function in `gatsby-node.js` add this line: `config.removeLoader('images')`

You'll also need to add `image-webpack-loader` to your site:

`npm install --save-dev image-webpack-loader`

Enjoy!

## Minor (but awesome) improvements
- Some css module types (Less/Sass) weren't being minimized https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/0a667e0abfab8b68f8ea4b0d2ab80c48256abab0
- @adjohnson916 noticed we were using a private API of React Router https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/343
- Added check for processes listening to the port requested by `gatsby serve-build` similar to what we do for `gatsby listen` #345
- Set the `NODE_ENV` to `production` for node code (we were already doing this for Webpack modules but some Webpack loaders don't behave correctly without this fix #348

This is a best practice recommended by Google's AMP project among others as you then avoid additional requests which can signifcantly slow down your site. Testing using webpagetest.org showed that moving css inline improved the Speed Index 20-50%!! In one test on a simulated 3G connection, the time to initial render went from [~1.8 seconds](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/160508_FF_8WW/) to [~1 second](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/160508_95_8YQ/).

It's a very simple switch to make. See this commit in the default starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/commit/1faecb5a7ded5585b12e8330f9aaa663f9d8b769 It's also documented at https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby#inline-css

## Breaking changes
- `post-build.js` moved inside `gatsby-node.js`. If you had added a `post-build.js` module to your code, this function should now be exported from `gatsby-node.js`. A simple way to make the change is to simply require `post-build.js` there e.g. `
  exports.postBuild = require('./post-build')`. Thanks to @LukeSheard for this! #273
- The ""stages"" were renamed. If you override Webpack configs and are switching behavior based on the stage, `static` is split into two stages, `build-css` and `build-html` and `production` is now `build-javascript`. We think these are much more sensible names. Thanks to @scottnonnenberg for the this! #253 

## Other notable non-breaking changes

@benstepp did a deep refactor of how we're loading Babel plugins. There shouldn't be any breaking changes but it fixes a number of bugs https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/279

Some highlights:
- User can override the `.babelrc` passed to webpack.
- User can use whatever babel plugins they want.
- User babel config is extended with `react-hmre` rather than being overwritten in develop.js.
- Object.assign is now polyfilled by default.
- Non breaking change as starters previously required a babelrc and gatsby will just read them as normal.
- Fixes three issues #129, #235, #264

Also we hit 2500 stars as I was writing this review :tada: 

## Babel 6

Gatsby started its life on Babel 5 but Babel 6 is out and stable so we'll upgrade along with the rest of the ecosystem and take advantage of [its improved performance and awesome new plugin api](https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0).

## Gatsby must now be installed as a dependency of the site

The global Gatsby install now defers to the local install of Gatsby (and throws if it can't find one). This means you can build a site and not worry about needing to upgrade it again as Gatsby accumulates breaking changes. This also helps ensure Gatsby works in environments where you don't want a global install e.g. build servers.

### Upgrade instructions
- Install Gatsby — `npm install --save gatsby`
- Install new Babel 6 dependencies (they must be installed locally) — `npm install --save babel-plugin-add-module-exports babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-1` and `npm install --save-dev babel-preset-react-hmre`.
- Uninstall old Babel 5 dependencies (if you added any).
- The `link` function from `gatsby-helpers.js` was renamed to `prefixLink` to clarify its purpose.
- Your `.babelrc` file needs to be upgraded to look like:

```
{
  ""presets"": ['react', 'es2015', 'stage-1'],
  ""plugins"": ['add-module-exports']
}
```
- If you modified the default Webpack config in `gatsby.config.js`, this functionality is now moved to `gatsby-node.js` and instead of using module.exports, export your config modification function as `modifyWebpackConfig`. See the [updated instructions in the README](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby#how-to-use-your-own-webpack-loaders).
- If you were differentiating between pages with content (like .md files) and pages without (like pages/profile.js) by looking for truthy `page.data`, you'll now need check for truthy `page.data.body`.
- If your site is under version control, you might want to ignore the new auto-written module `.gatsby-context.js`.
- **rare** if you used the `rewritePath`, `onRouteChange` hooks in your app.js — app.js is now not supported. Instead you should export `rewritePath` in `gatsby-node.js` and `onRouteChange` in `gatsby-browser.js`. The function signatures didn't change. These new files will be gaining more functionality in future releases.

That's it! See you in the issue queues :-)

Finished off a major new release of Gatsby in time for ReactConf :tada:

## New features
- Support Less/Sass/Postcss out of the box. CSS files are processed using the excellent [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/).
- Support extracting and minifying css on production builds to an external `styles.css` file.
- React-Router 2.0 :tada:

## Internals work
- We're using Webpack Hot Middleware + react-transform-hmr now instead of react-hot-loader.
- All remaining Coffeescript files have been converted to JS. 

## Breaking changes.

React Router has made two major releases since Gatsby was first built with a ton of nice improvements. But as Gatsby uses React Router heavily, its breaking changes often cause breaking changes within Gatsby.

The main change is what props are passed to `_template` and wrapper components. Previously each component was passed the current `page` data and a `pages` array of all pages. Now this information is put onto the `route` prop passed in by React Router.

Also where previously React Router provided a `<RouteHandler/>` component which rendered the children components in `_template` files, you should now replace those with `{this.props.children}`.

## Upgrading
- Install new packages: `npm install --save react-router@latest lodash@latest` && `npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-transform@1.1.1 react-transform-catch-errors react-transform-hmr redbox-react`
- Adjust templates and wrappers (and other components as necessary) to account for the React Router changes.

Gatsby tries to anticipate most needs out of the box but many projects will need some customizations to Webpack.

The big change for this release was updating React to 0.14. Thanks to @patrykkopycinski for his [PR](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/81)!

We're still on the 0.13 series of React Router as their recent 1.0 release will require internal updates to Gatsby. Follow along at https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/32 if interested.

## `gatsby serve` now `gatsby develop`

Serve implied Gatsby was just serving up files. Develop conveys the idea better that you're starting up a full-fledged development server with the intent to start developing.

## Can now do webpack requires in your html.jsx

Previously you couldn't do webpack requires in your html component as the development server was requiring the module in node context. But with the help of @petehunt's [webpack-require](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-require) project, you can now require css or anything else you'd like in your html.jsx.

## Improved support for prefixing site links e.g. when building for Github Pages.

[See the documentation that's been added to the README.](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby#deploying-to-github-pages-and-other-times-your-sites-links-need-prefixes)

# How to upgrade

You'll need to update React in your project to React 0.14 as well as upgrade any React components that relied on older React APIs. Make sure to _not_ install the latest react-router.
