I recommend to be extra cautious when upgrading -- make sure it's not peak hour of usage and that you have a backup.

Also in this version we replaced the HighCharts charting library with Plot.ly's library, as the former wasn't open source.

While I'm usually online on our [Slack channel](http://slack.redash.io), I'll also be available specifically for upgrade questions & help during the following ""office hours"":
- [Monday 18/1 20:00-22:00 UTC](http://time.is/2000_18_Jan_2016_in_UTC) (click on the link to see it in your time zone)
- [Tuesday 19/1 11:00-13:00 UTC](http://time.is/1100_19_Jan_2016_in_UTC)

I will post additional office hours on the [blog](http://blog.redash.io) and [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/getredash).

If anything isn't clear, don't hesitate to reach out over Slack or Google Groups. Also ""private support"" is available - see here for details.

## Backward Incompatible Changes

In this release we made two backward incompatible settings changes:
- The default validation method for API calls is now simple api key, vs. HMAC. If you were already using the HMAC validation and want to keep using it, add to your `/opt/redash/.env` file: `export REDASH_AUTH_TYPE=hmac`.
- There is a built in mechanism of query results cleanup that was disabled by default. From this release it will be enabled by default. It will delete unreferenced query results that are older than 7 days. If you want to disable this mechanism, add to your `/opt/redash/.env` file: `export REDASH_QUERY_RESULTS_CLEANUP_ENABLED=false`.
