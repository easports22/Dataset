Changes since `1.0.36`: https://github.com/github/gh-ost/compare/v1.0.36...v1.0.40

Notable:

- Fix to **data integrity issue**: corruption in `timestamp(6)` and `datetime(6)` microsecond values when smaller than `0.1sec`, https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/452
- Fix to **data integrity issue**: `kill` on the master connection could cause a premature cut-over without all the rows being copied, https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/445
- Fix to **data integrity issue**: support for `alter table .. change column X` where X is a different letter case than original column, https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/447
- supporting tables that reach up to and including max length (`64` characters), https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/451
- Hibernate on critical load: when `critical-load-hibernate-seconds > 0`, then the behavior of `critical-load` changes. Instead of panicking and bailing out with error, `gh-ost` enters hibernation. https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/424
- `dml-batch-size` is dynamic, supported up to `1000`
- `http-throttle` outputs clearer throttle messahes
- `http-throttle` is freno aware and outputs clearer throttle messahes
- fix to `critical-load` hibernation check
- support for `drop + add` a column of same name (`gh-ost` will recognize the before/after columns to be unrelated)
- RDS documentation, thanks @jacobbednarz
- improved documentation, thanks @jessbreckenridge 
- more...

- fixed ""close sync with err: sync is been closing..."" message

`gh-ost` now supports and uses [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/). The community will now have visibility into CI tests on both external and internal PRs.

- fix to `throttle-control-replicas` dynamic setting; showing number of throttle control replicas in status
- added ""common questions"" doc page

notable:
- Batched writes for applying binlog events onto _ghost_ table: solving https://github.com/github/gh-ost/issues/348, this increases write capacity for `gh-ost` without introducing delays or stalls. See https://github.com/github/gh-ost/issues/352
- Only using internal heartbeat mechanism.  `--replication-lag-query` is now deprecated and unused. `gh-ost` has its own subsecond resolution replication lag measurement which it uses both on the connected server as well as on the control-replicas. See https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/347
- support for `--master-user` and `--master-password`, for when master and replicas have different credentials.
- Add possibility to set `server-id` as command line flag - contribution by @cypiszzz, see https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/349
- `--check-flag` is a flag with which one can check if other flags are supported. Used for scripting and testing in lieu of evolving and changing versions. See https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/351

notable:

4843535,2016-12-06T12:12:23Z,2016-12-06T12:21:06Z,GA release v1.0.30,"Many additions since `1.0.28`. The ultimate breakdown is https://github.com/github/gh-ost/compare/v1.0.28...v1.0.30

Notable:
- Fixed cut-over stall: when cut-over happened to start executing even as lag or otherwise a throttling condition also emerged, a race condition would make the cut-over stall until throttling reason went away. The fix is that cut-over _does not wait_, and at worst, rolls back.
- fix to cut-over retries -- it didn't throttle properly in between and did not cleanup properly in between.
- cut-over timeout on ""unknown"" stalls. An example to ""unknown"" was the throttling problem described above. I don't know what other unknowns there are, but cut-over is now generically resilient to them.
- support for `--skip-foreign-key-checks` - can save inspection time, when one is _certain_ no FKs actually exist
- Made column-rename detection heuristic more robust (it could wrongly infer a rename by some unfortunate comment or column-name)
- Reading and reporting replication lag before waiting on initial replication event -- this adds visibility in seemingly-hanging operations where the replica is lagging in the first place
- changelog table uses same engine as original table
- on startup, verifying replication works all all the way up to the master.

Notable:
- support for `DATETIME` subsecond resolution
- user-commanded throttling implies complete silence, not even `heartbeat` is written
- fixed `log_slave_updates` check on `--test-on-replica` and `--migrate-on-replica`
- cleanly closing streamer connection (connection that imposes as a replica) upon completion
- on `--exact-rowcount`, `--concurrent-rowcount` now defaults `true`
- added validation to confirm table structure on master & replica is identical (yes, the counter case happened)
- correct (though suboptimal) behavior on `enum` being part of the migration key

Notable:
-  [support for --critical-load-interval-millis](https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/266) -- a 2nd threshold sample to allows for graceful recovery from sudden and immediate spike.
- [better](https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/236) support for [non-utf](https://github.com/github/gh-ost/pull/227) charsets; help [requested](https://github.com/github/gh-ost/issues/228).

- Support for `latin1` (but for other character sets, please see https://github.com/github/gh-ost/issues/228). `utf8` and `utf8md4` supported out of the box.
- named cut-over: a configurable protection mechanism to require table name when commanding `postpone` on interactive commands. `--force-named-cut-over` is introduced.
