- URL parameter syntax changed from `/:id` to `/{id}` for even more flexible routing, such as `/articles/{month}-{day}-{year}-{slug}`, `/articles/{id}`, and `/articles/{id}.{ext}` on the same router
- Support for regexp for routing patterns, in the form of `/{paramKey:regExp}` for example: `r.Get(""/articles/{name:[a-z]+}"", h)` and `chi.URLParam(r, ""name"")`
- Add `Method` and `MethodFunc` to `chi.Router` to allow routing definitions such as `r.Method(""GET"", ""/"", h)` which provides a cleaner interface for custom handlers like in `_examples/custom-handler`
- Deprecating `mux#FileServer` helper function. Instead, we encourage users to create their own using file handler with the stdlib, see `_examples/fileserver` for an example
- Add support for LINK/UNLINK http methods via `r.Method()` and `r.MethodFunc()`
- Moved the chi project to its own organization, to allow chi-related community packages to be easily discovered and supported, at: https://github.com/go-chi

  community `net/context` package has been included in the standard library as `context` and
  utilized by `net/http` and `http.Request` to managing deadlines, cancelation signals and other
  request-scoped values. We're very excited about the new context addition and are proud to
  introduce chi v2, a minimal and powerful routing package for building large HTTP services,
  with zero external dependencies. Chi focuses on idiomatic design and encourages the use of 
  stdlib HTTP handlers and middlwares.
- chi v2 deprecates its `chi.Handler` interface and requires `http.Handler` or `http.HandlerFunc`
- chi v2 stores URL routing parameters and patterns in the standard request context: `r.Context()`
- chi v2 lower-level routing context is accessible by `chi.RouteContext(r.Context()) *chi.Context`,
  which provides direct access to URL routing parameters, the routing path and the matching
  routing patterns.
- Users upgrading from chi v1 to v2, need to:
  1. Update the old chi.Handler signature, `func(ctx context.Context, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)` to
     the standard http.Handler: `func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`
  2. Use `chi.URLParam(r *http.Request, paramKey string) string`
     or `URLParamFromCtx(ctx context.Context, paramKey string) string` to access a url parameter value
