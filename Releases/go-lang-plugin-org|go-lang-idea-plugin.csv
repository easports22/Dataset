This release focuses mostly on fixes. The most critical issues which were fixed in this release are auto-importing packages from unreachable `testdata` directories and resolving `cap` expressions.

Also here are couple improvements which this release brings:

### Go vet tool

`go vet` tool is built-in tool now and can be invoked on selected file or directory via `Code | Go Tools | Go vet` menu or via editor menu.

### Expression Type

`Show info` action is reimplemented using built-in `Expression Type` action which is available by `Alt+=` (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Mac) shortcut. Also it works now on variable/constant definitions.

### Autoscroll from source and Navigate in... features

Since this release it's possible to use `Autoscroll form source` mode in `File structure` tool window for `go` sources. `Navigate to... | File Structure` action works now as well.

This release focuses mostly on fixes and improvements. It contains fixes in resolution algorithms and in running tests mechanism.

## Read/Write access

### New inspections and quick fixes

In this release, the part which is responsible for detecting read/write access to variables was completely rewritten. Based on this the new inspection  `_ used as value inspection` is introduced and added new `Replace with ':='` quick fix for unresolved variables with write access.

<img width=""400"" alt=""replace_with_declaration"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/140920/14285945/0465b840-fb56-11e5-8893-ce0c279fa770.gif"">

### Improved inspections and quick fixes

Also `Introduce constants` quick fix won't be suggested for unresolved variables with write access and `Cannot assign to constant` catches more cases now.

### Find usages grouping

Grouping by read/write access in find usages works more accurate as well.

## Run configurations

Now you can see real `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` values which are used during compilation and running your application. Also, now there is an easy way to restart run configuration after compilation error.

This release introduces compatibility with IDEA 2016.1 and long-expected vendoring experiment support.

To install the plugin, visit the [readme](https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin#pre-release-builds).

# Changes

First of all, the plugin now supports IDEA 2016.1 and all IDEs based on this release version.

Also, this is the last update compatible to IDEA 14.1 and all IDEs based on 141.\* builds.

### Vendoring

With the new version the plugin now supports the Go 1.5 Vendoring Experiment. This means that all imports from vendored packages will be resolved properly. Auto-import quick fix and package completion are also working corresponding to vendoring experiment rules now. Moreover, completion lists are less polluted since the symbols defined in unreachable vendored packages are excluded.

### Internal Packages

Internal package are supported in the same way as vendoring. The special inspection now highlights invalid usages of internal package and unreachable internal packages are filtered out from completion list.

### Rerun Failed Tests

Another new feature is the ability to **Rerun Failed Tests**: [![Rerun Failed Tests action](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/140920/13855322/d638f11e-ec80-11e5-9a24-2110e3730e9e.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDH4XMinjYk)

### Test function name completion and auto-import while generating tests

![complete_test_names](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/140920/14091905/9630c1ae-f54b-11e5-9859-965f17ee3e1a.gif)

## Release notes

### Configuration

Starting with this pre-release Go SDK could be set in small IDEs (RubyMine, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm) and all code insight is available there as well. There is a new configurable in `Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Go | Go SDK`. 
Essentially `Go SDK` settings are treated as `$GOROOT` and `Go Libraries` – `$GOPATH`. In IntelliJ IDEA `Go SDK` page is missing due to existence built-in SDK settings in `File | Project Structure`;

### Running
- Fixed running single test method;
- 'File'-test kind is also fixed. Now file is run in package scope with the filter contaning all method names in selected file;
- `Go Application` run configuration is also fixed in someway and I hope you'll be able to run multi-files applications from IDE;
- For now it's possible to customize environment variables in Run Configurations;

### Completion
- Names of imported package added to completion even if they don't have an alias;
- Types from all files are added in completion list with auto-import functionality;
- Completion with auto-import became a little smarter. Now it can complete something like `f.prin` to `fmt.Println()` and will insert `import ""fmt""` automatically;  
- Completion items of types now contain import path of their package. I believe it makes simplier choosing items with the same name and package;

### Inspections and highlighting
- @jakecoffman implemented custom color highlighting for `hex` and `oct` numbers;
- Some performance improvements were made.
