It is hard to explain, so start the Hugo development server with `hugo server` and start editing. Live reloads just got so much faster! The ""how and what"" is discussed at length in [other places](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/3959), but the short version is that we now re-render only the parts of the site that you are working on.

The second performance-related feature is a follow-up to the Template Metrics added in Hugo `0.29`. Now, if you add the flag `--templateMetricsHints`, we will calculate a score for how your partials can be cached (with the `partialCached` template func).

This release also more or less makes the really fast Chroma highlighter a complete alternative to Pygments. Most noteable is the new table `linenos` support ([7c30e2cb](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/7c30e2cbb08fdf0e61f80c7f1aa29909aeca4211) [@bep](https://github.com/bep) [#3915](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3915)), which makes copy-and-paste code blocks much easier.

This release represents **31 contributions by 10 contributors** to the main Hugo code base.
[@bep](https://github.com/bep) leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contribution, but also a big shoutout to [@moorereason](https://github.com/moorereason), [@digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman), and [@bmon](https://github.com/bmon) for their ongoing contributions.
And as always a big thanks to [@digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman) for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition.

## Notes

* Running `hugo server` will now run with the new ""Fast Render Mode"" default on. To turn it off, run `hugo server --disableFastRender` or set `disableFastRender=true` in your site config.
* There have been several fixes and enhancements in the Chroma highlighter. One is that it now creates Pygments compatible CSS classes, which means that you may want to re-generate the stylesheet. See the [Syntax Highlighting Doc](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/).

Hugo `0.29` brings Template Metrics by [@moorereason](https://github.com/moorereason). Hugo is very fast, but it is still possible to write ineffective templates. Now these should be easy to identify. Just run:

```bash
hugo --templateMetrics
```
Now, that was the tasty carrot. The real reason this release comes so fast after the last one is to change the default value for the new `noHTTPCache` flag, which gives away too much performance to make sense as a default value.

A big thank you to [Alec Thomas](https://github.com/alecthomas) for taking on this massive task of porting the popular python highlighter Pygments to Go.

See the [Updated Documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/) for more information about how this works.

Worth mentioning is also the `liveReloadPort`  flag on `hugo server`, which makes it possible to do ""live reloads"" behind a HTTPS proxy, which makes for very cool remote customer demos. 

One example would be a Hugo server running behind a [ngrok](http://ngrok.com) tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 1313
```
Then start the Hugo server with:

```bash
hugo server -b https://youridhere.ngrok.io --appendPort=false --liveReloadPort=443 --navigateToChanged
```

The `navigateToChanged` flag is slightly unrelated, but it is super cool ...

## Notes
* Hugo now uses Chroma as new default syntax highlighter. This should in most cases work out-of-the box or with very little adjustments. But if you want to continue to use Pygments, set `pygmentsUseClassic=true` in your site config.
* We now add a set of ""no cache"" headers to the responses for `hugo server`, which makes the most sense in most development scenarios. Run with `hugo server --noHTTPCache=false` to get the old behaviour.

![Hugo Open on Save](https://cdn-standard5.discourse.org/uploads/gohugo/optimized/2X/6/622088d4a8eacaf62bbbaa27dab19d789e10fe09_1_690x345.gif ""Hugo Open on Save"")

If you start with `hugo server --navigateToChanged`, Hugo will navigate to the relevant page on save (see animated GIF). This is extremely useful for site-wide edits. Another very useful feature in this version is the added support for `AND` (`intersect`)  and `OR` (`union`)  filters when combined with `where`.

Example:

```go
{{ $pages := where .Site.RegularPages ""Type"" ""not in"" (slice ""page"" ""about"") }}
{{ $pages := $pages | union (where .Site.RegularPages ""Params.pinned"" true) }}
{{ $pages := $pages | intersect (where .Site.RegularPages ""Params.images"" ""!="" nil) }}
```

The above fetches regular pages not of `page` or `about` type unless they are pinned. And finally, we exclude all pages with no `images` set in Page params.

This release represents **36 contributions by 12 contributors** to the main Hugo code base. [@bep](https://github.com/bep) still leads the Hugo development with his witty Norwegian humor, and once again contributed a significant amount of additions.

## Fixes

* Fix archetype regression when no archetype file [4294dd8d](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/4294dd8d9d22bd8107b7904d5389967da1f83f27) [@bep](https://github.com/bep) [#3626](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3626)

This is **The Revival of the Archetypes!**

> ""A feature that could be the name of the next Indiana Jones movie deserves its own release,"" says [@bep](https://github.com/bep).

Hugo now handles the **archetype files as Go templates**. This means that the issues with sorting and lost comments are long gone. This also means that you will have to supply all values, including title and date. But this also opens up a lot of new windows.

A fictional example for the section `newsletter` and the archetype file `archetypes/newsletter.md`:

```markdown
---
title: ""{{ replace .TranslationBaseName ""-"" "" "" | title }}""
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true
---

**Insert Lead paragraph here.**

<!--more-->

## New Cool Posts

{{ range first 10 ( where .Site.RegularPages ""Type"" ""cool"" ) }}
* {{ .Title }}
{{ end }}
```

And then create a new post with:

```bash
hugo new newsletter/the-latest-cool.stuff.md
```

**Note:** the site will only be built if the `.Site` is in use in the archetype file, and this can be time consuming for big sites.

**Hot Tip:** If you set the `newContentEditor` configuration variable to an editor on your `PATH`, the newly created article will be opened.

The above _newsletter type archetype_ illustrates the possibilities: The full Hugo `.Site` and all of Hugo&#39;s template funcs can be used in the archetype file.

**Also, Hugo now supports archetype files for all content formats, not just markdown.**

Hugo now has:

* 17839&#43; [stars](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/stargazers)
* 493&#43; [contributors](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/graphs/contributors)
* 166&#43; [themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/)

## Notes

* Archetype files now need to be complete, including `title` and `date`.
* The `-f` (format) flag in `hugo new` is removed: Now use the archetype files as is.

## Enhancements

* Support extension-less media types. The motivation behind this change is to support Netlify&#39;s `_redirects` files, so we can generate server-side redirects for the Hugo docs site. See [this commit](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/commit/c1ab9894e8292e0a74c43bbca2263b1fb3840f9e) to see how we configured that.

Hugo `0.22.1` fixes a couple of issues reported after the [0.22 release](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/tag/v0.22) Monday. Most importantly a fix for detecting regular subfolders below the root-sections.

Also, we forgot to adapt the `permalink settings` with support for nested sections, which made that feature less useful than it could be.

With this release you can configure **permalinks with sections** like this:

**First level only:**

```toml
[permalinks]
blog = "":section/:title""
```

**Nested (all levels):**

```toml
[permalinks]
blog = "":sections/:title""
```

We are still low on documentation for this great feature, but [@bep](https://github.com/bep)  has been kind enough to accompany his implementation with a [demo site](http://hugotest.bep.is/).

This release represents **58 contributions by 10 contributors** to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has **gained 420 stars and 2 additional themes.**

[@bep](https://github.com/bep) still leads the Hugo development with his witty Norwegian humor, and once again contributed a significant amount of additions. But also a big shoutout to [@bogem](https://github.com/bogem), [@moorereason](https://github.com/moorereason), and [@onedrawingperday](https://github.com/onedrawingperday) for their ongoing contributions. And as always big thanks to [@digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman) for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition.

Hugo now has:

* 17576&#43; [stars](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/stargazers)
* 455&#43; [contributors](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/graphs/contributors)
* 165&#43; [themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/)

## Other Highlights

`.Site.GetPage` can now also be used to get regular pages ([#2844](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2844)):

```go
{{ (.Site.GetPage ""page"" ""blog"" ""mypost.md"" ).Title }}
```

Also, considerable work has been put into writing automated benchmark tests for the site builds, and we&#39;re happy to report that although this release comes with fundamental structural changes, this version is -- in general -- even faster than the previous. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously maintain the stellar performance Hugo is famous for. 


 
## Notes

`.Site.Sections` is replaced. We have reworked how sections work in Hugo, they can now be nested and are no longer taxonomies. If you use the old collection, you should get detailed upgrade instructions in the log when you run `hugo`. For more information, see this [demo site](http://hugotest.bep.is/).

6462777,2017-05-22T13:11:22Z,2017-05-22T13:25:04Z,v0.21,"Hugo `0.21` brings full support for shortcodes per [Output Format](https://gohugo.io/extras/output-formats/) ([#3220](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3220)), the last vital piece of that puzzle. This is especially useful for `Google AMP` with its many custom media tags.

This release represents **126 contributions by 29 contributors** to the main Hugo code base. Since last main release Hugo has **gained 850 stars and 7 additional themes**.

[@bep](https://github.com/bep) leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to [@moorereason](https://github.com/moorereason), [@bogem](https://github.com/bogem), and [@munnerz](https://github.com/munnerz) for their ongoing contributions. And as always a big thanks to [@digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman) for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition.

## Other Highlights

On a more technical side, [@moorereason](https://github.com/moorereason) and [@bep](https://github.com/bep) have introduced namespaces for Hugo&#39;s many template funcs ([#3042](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3042) ). There are so many now, and adding more into that big pile would be a sure path toward losing control.  Now they are nicely categorised into namespaces with its own tests and examples, with an API that the documentation site can use to make sure it is correct and up-to-date.

## Notes

* The deprecated `.Extension`, `.Now` and `.TargetPath` will now `ERROR` [544f0a63](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/commit/544f0a6394b0e085d355e8217fc5bb3d96c12a98) [@bep](https://github.com/bep)

Hugo `0.20.2` adds support for plain text partials included into `HTML` templates. This was a side-effect of the big new [Custom Output Format](https://gohugo.io/extras/output-formats/) feature in `0.20`, and while the change was intentional and there was an ongoing discussion about fixing it in [#3273](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3273), it did break some themes. There were valid workarounds for these themes, but we might as well get it right.

The most obvious use case for this is inline `CSS` styles, which you now can do without having to name your partials with a `html` suffix.

A simple example:

In `layouts/partials/mystyles.css`:

    body {
    	background-color: {{ .Param ""colors.main"" }}
    }

Then in `config.toml` (note that by using the `.Param` lookup func, we can override the color in a page’s front matter if we want):

    [params]
    [params.colors]
    main = ""green""
    text = ""blue""

And then in `layouts/partials/head.html` (or the partial used to include the head section into your layout):

    <head>
        <style type=""text/css"">
        {{ partial ""mystyles.css"" . | safeCSS }}
        </style>
    </head>

Of course, `0.20` also made it super-easy to create external `CSS` stylesheets based on your site and page configuration. A simple example:

Add “CSS” to your home page’s `outputs` list, create the template `/layouts/index.css` using Go template syntax for the dynamic parts, and then include it into your `HTML` template with:

    {{ with  .OutputFormats.Get ""css"" }}
    <link rel=""{{ .Rel }}"" type=""{{ .MediaType.Type }}"" href=""{{ .Permalink |  safeURL }}"">
    {{ end }}`",https://api.github.com/users/bep,394382,bep,https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/releases/6092004/assets,https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/releases/6092004,v0.20.2rb,https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/tarball/v0.20.2,https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.20.2,https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/zipball/v0.20.2,v0.20.2,False,False

Hugo `0.20` introduces the powerful and long sought after feature [Custom Output Formats](http://gohugo.io/extras/output-formats/); Hugo isn’t just that “static HTML with an added RSS feed” anymore. _Say hello_ to calendars, e-book formats, Google AMP, and JSON search indexes, to name a few ( [#2828](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2828) ).

This release represents **over 180 contributions by over 30 contributors** to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has **gained 1100 stars, 20 new contributors and 5 additional themes.**

Hugo now has:

*   16300+ stars
*   495+ contributors
*   156+ themes

[@bep](//github.com/bep) still leads the Hugo development with his witty Norwegian humor, and once again contributed a significant amount of additions. Also a big shoutout to [@digitalcraftsman](//github.com/digitalcraftsman) for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, and [@moorereason](//github.com/moorereason) and [@bogem](//github.com/bogem) for their ongoing contributions.

## Other Highlights

[@bogem](//github.com/bogem) has also contributed TOML as an alternative and much simpler format for language/i18n files ([#3200](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3200)). A feature you will appreciate when you start to work on larger translations.

Also, there have been some important updates in the Emacs Org-mode handling: [@chaseadamsio](//github.com/chaseadamsio) has fixed the newline-handling ( [#3126](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3126) ) and [@clockoon](//github.com/clockoon) has added basic footnote support.

Worth mentioning is also the ongoing work that [@rdwatters](//github.com/rdwatters) and [@budparr](//github.com/budparr) is doing to re-do the [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/) site, including a total restructuring and partial rewrite of the documentation. It is getting close to finished, and it looks fantastic!

## Notes

*   `RSS` description in the built-in template is changed from full `.Content` to `.Summary`. This is a somewhat breaking change, but is what most people expect from their RSS feeds. If you want full content, please provide your own RSS template.
*   The deprecated `.RSSlink` is now removed. Use `.RSSLink`.
*   `RSSUri` is deprecated and will be removed in a future Hugo version, replace it with an output format definition.
*   The deprecated `.Site.GetParam` is now removed, use `.Site.Param`.
*   Hugo does no longer append missing trailing slash to `baseURL` set as a command line parameter, making it consistent with how it behaves from site config. [#3262](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3262)

## Enhancements

*   Hugo `0.20` is built with Go 1.8.1.
*   Add `.Site.Params.mainSections` that defaults to the section with the most pages. Plan is to get themes to use this instead of the hardcoded `blog` in `where` clauses. [#3206](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3206)
*   File extension is now configurable. [#320](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/320)
*   Impove `markdownify` template function performance. [#3292](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3292)
*   Add taxonomy terms’ pages to `.Data.Pages` [#2826](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2826)
*   Change `RSS` description from full `.Content` to `.Summary`.
*   Ignore “.” dirs in `hugo --cleanDestinationDir` [#3202](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3202)
*   Allow `jekyll import` to accept both `2006-01-02` and `2006-1-2` date format [#2738](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2738)
*   Raise the default `rssLimit` [#3145](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3145)
*   Unify section list vs single template lookup order [#3116](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3116)

We’re happy to announce the first release of Hugo in 2017.

This release represents **over 180 contributions by over 50 contributors** to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has **gained 1450 stars, 35 new contributors and 15 additional themes.**

Hugo now has:
-   15200+ stars
-   470+ contributors
-   151+ themes

Furthermore, Hugo has its own Twitter account ([@gohugoio](https://twitter.com/gohugoio)) where we share bite-sized news and themes from the Hugo community.

[@bep](//github.com/bep) leads the Hugo development and once again contributed a significant amount of additions. Also a big shoutout to [@chaseadamsio](//github.com/chaseadamsio) for the Emacs Org-mode support, [@digitalcraftsman](//github.com/digitalcraftsman) for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, [@fj](//github.com/fj) for his work on revising the `params` handling in Hugo, and [@moorereason](//github.com/moorereason) and [@bogem](//github.com/bogem) for their ongoing contributions.

## Highlights

Hugo `0.19` brings native Emacs Org-mode content support ( [#1483](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1483) ), big thanks to [@chaseadamsio](//github.com/chaseadamsio).

Also, a considerably amount of work have been put into cleaning up the Hugo source code, in an issue titled [Refactor the globals out of site build](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2701). This is not immediately visible to the Hugo end user, but will speed up future development.

Hugo `0.18` was bringing full-parallel page rendering, so workarounds depending on rendering order did not work anymore, and pages with duplicate target paths (common examples would be `/index.md` or `/about/index.md`) would now conflict with the home page or the section listing.

With Hugo `0.19`, you can control this behaviour by turning off page types you do not want ( [#2534](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2534) ). In its most extreme case, if you put the below setting in your `config.toml`, you will get **nothing!**:

```
disableKinds = [""page"", ""home"", ""section"", ""taxonomy"", ""taxonomyTerm"", ""RSS"", ""sitemap"", ""robotsTXT"", ""404""]
```

Today, we’re excited to release the much-anticipated Hugo 0.18!

We’re heading towards the end of the year 2016, and we can look back on three releases and a steady growing community around the project. This release includes **over 220 contributions by nearly 50 contributors** to the main codebase. Since the last release, Hugo has **gained 1750 stars and 27 additional themes**.

Hugo now has:
-   13750+ stars
-   408+ contributors
-   137+ themes

[@bep](//github.com/bep) once again took the lead of Hugo and contributed a significant amount of additions. Also a big shoutout to [@digitalcraftsman](//github.com/digitalcraftsman) for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, and also a big thanks to [@moorereason](//github.com/moorereason) and [@bogem](//github.com/bogem) for their contributions.

We wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  
_The Hugo team_

## Highlights

The primary new feature in Hugo 0.18 is that every piece of content is now a `Page` ( [#2297](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2297) ). This means that every page, including the home page, can have a content file with frontmatter. Not only is this a much simpler model to understand, it is also faster and paved the way for several important new features:
-   Enable proper titles for Nodes [#1051](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1051)
-   Sitemap.xml should include nodes, as well as pages [#1303](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1303)
-   Document homepage content workaround [#2240](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2240)
-   Allow home page to be easily authored in markdown [#720](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/720)
-   Minimalist website with homepage as content [#330](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/330)

Hugo again continues its trend of each release being faster than the last. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously dramatically improve performance. Running [this benchmark](https://github.com/bep/hugo-benchmark) with [these sites](https://github.com/bep/hugo-benchmark/tree/master/sites) (renders to memory) shows about 60% reduction in time spent and 30% reduction in memory usage compared to Hugo 0.17.

## Other New Features
-   Every `Page` now has a `Kind` property. Since everything is a `Page` now, the `Kind` is used to differentiate different kinds of pages. Possible values are `page`, `home`, `section`, `taxonomy`, and `taxonomyTerm`. (Internally, we also define `RSS`, `sitemap`, `robotsTXT`, and `404`, but those have no practical use for end users at the moment since they are not included in any collections.)
-   Add a `GitInfo` object to `Page` if `enableGitInfo` is set. It then also sets `Lastmod` for the given `Page` to the author date provided by Git. [#2291](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2291)
-   Implement support for alias templates [#2533](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2533)
-   New template functions:
  -   Add `imageConfig` function [#2677](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2677)
  -   Add `sha256` function [#2762](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2762)
  -   Add `partialCached` template function [#1368](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1368)
-   Add shortcode to display Instagram images [#2690](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2690)
-   Add `noChmod` option to disable perm sync [#2749](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2749)
-   Add `quiet` build mode [#1218](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1218)

## Notices
-   `.Site.Pages` will now contain _several kinds of pages_, including regular pages, sections, taxonomies, and the home page. If you want a specific kind of page, you can filter it with `where` and `Kind`. `.Site.RegularPages` is a shortcut to the page collection you have been used to getting.
-   `RSSlink` is now deprecated. Use `RSSLink` instead. Note that in Hugo 0.17 both of them existed, so there is a fifty-fifty chance you will not have to do anything (if you use a theme, the chance is close to 0), and `RSSlink` will still work for two Hugo versions.

## Fixes
-   Revise the `base` template lookup logic so it now better matches the behavior of regular templates, making it easier to override the master templates from the theme [#2783](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2783)
-   Add workaround for `block` template crash. Block templates are very useful, but there is a bug in Go 1.6 and 1.7 which makes the template rendering crash if you use the block template in more complex scenarios. This is fixed in the upcoming Go 1.8, but Hugo adds a temporary workaround in Hugo 0.18. [#2549](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2549)
-   All the `Params` configurations are now case insensitive [#1129](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1129) [#2590](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2590) [#2615](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2615)
-   Make RawContent raw again [#2601](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2601)
-   Fix archetype title and date handling [#2750](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2750)
-   Fix TOML archetype parsing in `hugo new` [#2745](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2745)
-   Fix page sorting when weight is zero [#2673](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2673)
-   Fix page names that contain dot [#2555](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2555)
-   Fix RSS Title regression [#2645](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2645)
-   Handle ToC before handling shortcodes [#2433](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2433)
-   Only watch relevant themes dir [#2602](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2602)
-   Hugo new content creates TOML slices with closing bracket on new line [#2800](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2800)

## Improvements
-   Add page information to error logging in rendering [#2570](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2570)
-   Deprecate `RSSlink` in favor of `RSSLink`
-   Make benchmark command more useful [#2432](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2432)
-   Consolidate the `Param` methods [#2590](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2590)
-   Allow to set cache dir in config file
-   Performance improvements:
  -   Avoid repeated Viper loads of `sectionPagesMenu` [#2728](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2728)
  -   Avoid reading from Viper for path and URL funcs [#2495](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2495)
  -   Add `partialCached` template function. This can be a significant performance boost if you have complex partials that does not need to be rerendered for every page. [#1368](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1368)

## Documentation Updates
-   Update roadmap [#2666](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2666)
-   Update multilingual example [#2417](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2417)
-   Add a “Deployment with rsync” tutorial page [#2658](//github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2658)

We put a lot of thought into how we could extend Hugo to support multilingual websites with the most simple and elegant experience. Hugo’s multilingual capabilities rival the best web and documentation software, but Hugo’s experience is unmatched. If you have a single language website, the simple Hugo experience you already love is unchanged. Adding additional languages to your website is simple and straightforward. Hugo has been completely internally rewritten to be multilingual aware with translation and internationalization features embedded throughout Hugo.

Hugo continues its trend of each release being faster than the last. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously dramatically improve performance. [@bep](//github.com/bep) has made it his personal mission to apply the Go mantra of “Enable more. Do less” to Hugo. Hugo’s consistent improvement is a testament to his brilliance and his dedication to his craft. Hugo additionally benefits from the performance improvements from the Go team in the Go 1.7 release.

This release represents **over 300 contributions by over 70 contributors** to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has **gained 2000 stars, 50 new contributors and 20 additional themes.**

Hugo now has:
-   12,000 stars on GitHub
-   370+ contributors
-   110+ themes  

[@bep](//github.com/bep) continues to lead the project with the lionshare of contributions and reviews. A special thanks to [@bep](//github.com/bep) and [@abourget](//github.com/abourget) for their considerable work on multilingual support.

A big welcome to newcomers [@MarkDBlackwell](//github.com/MarkDBlackwell) , [@bogem](//github.com/bogem) and [@g3wanghc](//github.com/g3wanghc) for their critical contributions.

### Highlights

**Multilingual Support:** Hugo now supports multiple languages side-by-side. A single site can now have multiple languages rendered with full support for translation and i18n.

**Performance:** Hugo is faster than ever! Hugo 0.17 is not only our fastest release, it’s also the most efficient. Hugo 0.17 is **nearly twice as fast as Hugo 0.16** and uses about 10% less memory. This means that the same site will build in nearly half the time it took with Hugo 0.16. For the first time Hugo sites are averaging well under 1ms per rendered content.

**Docs overhaul:** This release really focused on improving the documentation. [Gohugo.io](http://gohugo.io) is more accurate and complete than ever.

**Support for macOS Sierra**

Hugo 0.16 is our best and biggest release ever. The Hugo community has outdone itself with continued performance improvements, [beautiful themes](http://themes.gohugo.io) for all types of sites from project sites to documentation to blogs to portfolios, and increased stability.

This release represents **over 550 contributions by over 110 contributors** to the main Hugo codebase. Since last release Hugo has **gained 3500 stars, 90 contributors and 23 additional themes.**

This release celebrates 3 years since [@spf13](//github.com/spf13) wrote the first lines of Hugo. During those 3 years Hugo has accomplished some major milestones including…
-   10,000+ stars on GitHub
-   320+ contributors
-   90+ themes
-   1000s of happy websites
-   Many subprojects like [@spf13/cobra](//github.com/spf13/cobra) , [@spf13/viper](//github.com/spf13/viper) and [@spf13/afero](//github.com/spf13/afero) which have experienced broad usage across the Go ecosystem.

[@bep](//github.com/bep) led the development of Hugo for the 3rd consecutive release with nearly half of the contributions to 0.16 in addition to his considerable contributions as lead maintainer. [@anthonyfok](//github.com/anthonyfok) , [@DigitalCraftsman](//github.com/DigitalCraftsman) , [@MooreReason](//github.com/MooreReason) all made significant contributions. A special thanks to [@abourget](//github.com/abourget%20) for his considerable work on multilingual support. Due to its broad impact we wanted to spend more time testing it and it will be included in Hugo’s next release.

### Highlights

**Partial Builds:** Prior to this release Hugo would always reread and rebuild the entire site. This release introduces support for reactive site building while watching (`hugo server`). Hugo will watch the filesystem for changes and only re-read the changed files. Depending on the files change Hugo will intelligently re-render only the needed portion of the site. Performance gains depend on the operation performed and size of the site. In our testing build times decreased anywhere from 10% to 99%.

**Template Improvements:** Template improvements continue to be a mainstay of each Hugo release. Hugo 0.16 adds support for the new `block` keyword introduced in Go 1.6 – think base templates with default sections – as well as many new template functions.

**Polish:** As Hugo matures releases will inevitably contain fewer huge new features. This release represents hundreds of small improvements across ever facet of Hugo which will make for a much better experience for all of our users. Worth mentioning here is the curious bug where live reloading didn’t work in some editors on OS X, including the popular TextMate 2. This is now fixed. Oh, and now any error will exit with an error code, a big thing for automated deployments.

### .deb packages for Debian, Ubuntu, etc.

Hugo has become part of the official Debian and Ubuntu repositories since January 2016!
Check out the following download links in Debian and Ubuntu:
- Debian: https://packages.debian.org/sid/hugo
- Ubuntu: http://packages.ubuntu.com/yakkety/hugo (awaiting sync from Debian as of 2016-06-12)

And, if you are already running the latest cutting-edge version of Debian or Ubuntu, simply run `apt-get install hugo` to get it!   :smile:

Or download the .deb files provided below (amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, ppc64, ppc64el are currently available, hopefully more coming soon).  For Raspberry Pi users running Raspbian and alike, the file you want is [hugo_0.16-1_armhf.deb](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.16/hugo_0.16-1_armhf.deb).

_Note: The .deb file sizes are smaller than other alternative downloads because the `/usr/bin/hugo` contained therein were stripped of debug symbols as per Debian policy.

### RPM package for Fedora (and Mandriva, openSUSE, etc.)

@jdoss has kindly uploaded and built the Hugo .rpm packages to the Fedora Copr.<sup>1</sup>  Please visit https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/spf13/Hugo/ to get them.

Alternatively, you may download [hugo-0.16-2.el6.x86_64.rpm](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.16/hugo-0.16-2.el6.x86_64.rpm) below (fetched from https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/spf13/Hugo/epel-6-x86_64/00341389-hugo/hugo-0.16-2.el6.x86_64.rpm) which should work on all flavors of RPM-based distributions running on x86_64 (amd64).

2184545,2015-11-25T14:33:53Z,2015-12-19T09:45:24Z,v0.15,"The v0.15.0 Hugo release brings a lot of polish to Hugo. Exactly 6 months after the 0.14 release, Hugo has seen massive growth and changes. Most notably, this is Hugo's first release under the Apache 2.0 license. With this license change we hope to expand the great community around Hugo and make it easier for our many users to contribute.  This release represents over **377 contributions by 87 contributors** to the main Hugo repo and hundreds of improvements to the libraries Hugo uses. Hugo also launched a [new theme showcase](http://themes.gohugo.io) and participated in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com).

Hugo now has:
- 6700 (+2700) stars on GitHub
- 235 (+75) contributors
- 65 (+30) themes

**Template Improvements:** This release takes Hugo to a new level of speed and usability. Considerable work has been done adding features and performance to the template system which now has full support of Ace, Amber and Go Templates.

**Hugo Import:** Have a Jekyll site, but dreaming of porting it to Hugo? This release introduces a new `hugo import jekyll`command that makes this easier than ever.

**Performance Improvements:** Just when you thought Hugo couldn't get any faster, Hugo continues to improve in speed while adding features. Notably Hugo 0.15 introduces the ability to render and serve directly from memory resulting in 30%+ lower render times.

Huge thanks to all who participated in this release. A special thanks to [@bep](https://github.com/bep) who led the development of Hugo this release again, [@anthonyfok](https://github.com/anthonyfok), [@eparis](https://github.com/eparis), [@tatsushid](https://github.com/tatsushid) and [@DigitalCraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/).

## New features
- new `hugo import jekyll` command. [#1469](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/pull/1469)
- The new `Param` convenience method on `Page` and `Node` can be used to get the most specific parameter value for a given key. [#1462](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1462)
- Several new information elements have been added to `Page` and `Node`:
  - `RuneCount`: The number of [runes](http://blog.golang.org/strings) in the content, excluding any whitespace. This may be a good alternative to `.WordCount`  for Japanese and other CJK languages where a word-split by spaces makes no sense.  [#1266](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1266)
  - `RawContent`: Raw Markdown as a string. One use case may be of embedding remarkjs.com slides.
  - `IsHome`: tells the truth about whether you're on the home page or not.

## Improvements
- `hugo server` now builds ~30%+ faster by rendering to memory instead of disk. To get the old behavior, start the server with `--renderToDisk=true`.
- Hugo now supports dynamic reloading of the config file when watching.
- We now use a custom-built `LazyFileReader` for reading file contents, which means we don't read media files in `/content` into memory anymore -- and file reading is now performed in parallel on multicore PCs. [#1181](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1181)
- Hugo is now built with `Go 1.5` which, among many other improvements, have fixed the last known data race in Hugo. [#917](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/917)
- Paginator now also supports page groups. [#1274](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1274)
- Markdown improvements:
  - Hugo now supports GitHub-flavoured markdown code fences for highlighting for `md`-files (Blackfriday rendered markdown) and `mmark` files (MMark rendered markdown). [#362](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/362) [#1258](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1258)
  - Several new Blackfriday options are added:
    - Option to disable Blackfriday's `Smartypants`.
    - Option for Blackfriday to open links in a new window/tab. [#1220](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1220)
    - Option to disable Blackfriday's LaTeX style dashes [#1231](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1231)
    - Definition lists extension support.
- `Scratch` now has built-in `map` support.
- We now fall back to `link title` for the default page sort. [#1299](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1299)
- Some notable new configuration options:
  -  `IgnoreFiles` can be set with a list of Regular Expressions that matches files to be ignored during build. [#1189](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1189)
  - `PreserveTaxonomyNames`, when set to `true`, will preserve what you type as the taxonomy name both in the folders created and the taxonomy `key`, but it will be normalized for the URL.  [#1180](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1180)
- `hugo gen` can now generate man files, bash auto complete and markdown documentation
- Hugo will now make suggestions when a command is mistyped
- Shortcodes now have a boolean `.IsNamedParams` property. [#1597](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/pull/1597)

## New Template Features
- All template engines:
  - The new `dict` function that could be used to pass maps into a template. [#1463](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/pull/1463)
  - The new `pluralize` and `singularize` template funcs.
  - The new `base64Decode` and `base64Encode` template funcs.
  - The `sort` template func now accepts field/key chaining arguments and pointer values. [#1330](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1330)
  - Several fixes for `slicestr` and `substr`, most importantly, they now have full `utf-8`-support. [#1190](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1190) [#1333](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1333) [#1347](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1347)
  - The new `last` template function allows the user to select the last `N` items of a slice. [#1148](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1148)
  - The new `after` func allows the user to select the items after the `Nth` item. [#1200](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/pull/1200)
  - Add `time.Time` type support to the `where`, `ge`, `gt`, `le`, and `lt` template functions.
  - It is now possible to use constructs like `where Values "".Param.key"" nil` to filter pages that doesn't have a particular parameter. [#1232](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1232)
  - `getJSON`/`getCSV`: Add retry on invalid content. [#1166](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1166)
  -   The new `readDir` func lists local files. [#1204](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/pull/1204)
  - The new `safeJS` function allows the embedding of content into JavaScript contexts in Go templates.
  - Get the main site RSS link from any page by accessing the `.Site.RSSLink` property. [#1566](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/pull/1566)
- Ace templates:
  - Base templates now also works in themes. [#1215](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1215).
  - And now also on Windows. [#1178](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1178)
- Full support for Amber templates including all template functions.
- A built-in template for Google Analytics. [#1505](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/pull/1505)
- Hugo is now shipped with new built-in shortcodes: [#1576](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1576)
  - `youtube` for YouTube videos
  - `vimeo` for Vimeo videos
  - `gist` for GitHub gists
  - `tweet` for Twitter Tweets
  - `speakerdeck` for Speakerdeck slides

## Bugfixes
- Fix data races in page sorting and page reversal. These operations are now also cached. [#1293](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1293)
- `page.HasMenuCurrent()` and `node.HasMenuCurrent()` now work correctly in multi-level nested menus.
- Support `Fish and Chips` style section titles. Previously, this would end up as  `Fish And Chips`. Now, the first character is made toupper, but the rest are preserved as-is. [#1176](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1176)
- Hugo now removes superfluous p-tags around shortcodes. [#1148](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1148)

## Notices
- `hugo server` will watch by default now.
- Some fields and methods were deprecated in `0.14`. These are now removed, so the error message isn't as friendly if you still use the old values. So please change:
  -   `getJson` to `getJSON`, `getCsv` to `getCSV`, `safeHtml` to
    `safeHTML`, `safeCss` to `safeCSS`, `safeUrl` to `safeURL`, `Url` to `URL`,
    `UrlPath` to `URLPath`, `BaseUrl` to `BaseURL`, `Recent` to `Pages`.

## Known Issues

Using the Hugo v0.15 32-bit Windows or ARM binary, running `hugo server` would crash or hang due to a [memory alignment issue](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#pkg-note-BUG) in [Afero](https://github.com/spf13/afero).  The bug was discovered shortly after the v0.15.0 release and has since been [fixed](https://github.com/spf13/afero/pull/23) by @tpng.  If you encounter this bug, you may either compile Hugo v0.16-DEV from source, or use the following solution/workaround:
- **64-bit Windows users: Please use [hugo_0.15_windows_amd64.zip](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.15/hugo_0.15_windows_amd64.zip)** (amd64 == x86-64).  It is only the 32-bit hugo_0.15_windows_386.zip that crashes/hangs (see #1621 and #1628).
- **32-bit Windows and ARM users: Please run `hugo server --renderToDisk` as a workaround** until Hugo v0.16 is released (see [“hugo server” returns runtime error on armhf](https://discuss.gohugo.io/t/hugo-server-returns-runtime-error-on-armhf/2293) and #1716).

The foundation of Hugo is stabilizing nicely and a lot of polish has been added. We’ve expanded support for additional content types with support for AsciiDoc, Restructured Text, HTML and Markdown. Some of these types depend on external libraries as there does not currently exist native support in Go. We’ve tried to make the experience as seamless as possible. Look for more improvements here in upcoming releases.

A lot of work has been done to improve the user experience, with extra polish to the Windows experience. Hugo errors are more helpful overall and Hugo now can detect if it’s being run in Windows Explorer and provide additional instructions to run it via the command prompt.

The Hugo community continues to grow. Hugo has over 4000 stars on github, 165 contributors, 35 themes and 1000s of happy users. It is now the 5th most popular static site generator (by Stars) and has the 3rd largest contributor community.

This release represents over **240 contributions by 36 contributors** to the main Hugo codebase.

Big shout out to [@bep](https://github.com/bep) who led the development of Hugo this release, [@anthonyfok](https://github.com/anthonyfok), [@eparis](https://github.com/eparis), [@SchumacherFM](https://github.com/SchumacherFM), [@RickCogley](https://github.com/RickCogley) & [@mdhender](https://github.com/mdhender) for their significant contributions and [@tatsushid](https://github.com/tatsushid) for his continuous improvements to the templates. Also a big thanks to all the theme creators. 11 new themes have been added since last release and the [hugoThemes repo now has previews of all of them](https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md#theme-list).

Hugo also depends on a lot of other great projects. A big thanks to all of our dependencies inclding:
[cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper), [blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday), [pflag](https://github.com/spf13/pflag), [HugoThemes](https://github.com/spf13/hugothemes), [BurntSushi/Toml](github.com/BurntSushi/toml), [goYaml](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/tree/v2), and the Go standard library.

## Notices
- To get variable and function names in line with the rest of the Go community,   a set of variable and function names has been deprecated: These will still  work in 0.14, but will be removed in 0.15. What to do should be obvious by  the build log; `getJson` to `getJSON`, `getCsv` to `getCSV`, `safeHtml` to   `safeHTML`, `safeCss` to `safeCSS`, `safeUrl` to `safeURL`, `Url` to `URL`,  `UrlPath` to `URLPath`, `BaseUrl` to `BaseURL`, `Recent` to `Pages`,  `Indexes` to `Taxonomies`.

    `le`; `<`, `lt`; `in`, `not in`
  - `where` template function now also accepts dot chaining key argument
    (e.g. `""Params.foo.bar""`)
- New template functions:
  - `apply`
  - `chomp`
  - `delimit`
  - `sort`
  - `markdownify`
  - `in` and `intersect` 
  - `trim`
  - `replace`
  - `dateFormat`
- Several [configurable improvements related to Markdown
  rendering](http://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/#configure-blackfriday-rendering:a66b35d20295cb764719ac8bd35837ec):
  - Configuration of footnote rendering
  - Optional support for smart angled quotes, e.g. `""Hugo""` → «Hugo»
