*Porters only*:

These changes affect porters who build the C++ metadata themselves (e.g. `cpp/src/phonenumbers/metadata.cc`) using our build tools:

*   Backwards-incompatible: the `protobuf-java` dependency used to build the C++ metadata changed from 2.5.0 to 3.0.0.
    *   If you run `mvn package` from a directory above `tools/java/cpp-build/pom.xml`, you need to either install `protoc` such that the version is 3.0.0, or update the `pom.xml` in your clone to the version number you're using.
*   Deprecation fix: C++ geocoding build tools now use `readdir`, since `readdir_r` is deprecated.

New functionality in this release:

*   New `getSupportedCallingCodes()` API in C++, Java, and JS to return all the calling codes that the library considers valid, both for geographical and non-geographical entities.
*   New `isSmsServiceForRegion(PhoneNumber, RegionCode)` API in C++ and Java short number info libraries. An SMS service is where the primary or only intended usage is to receive and/or send text messages (SMSs). This includes MMS as MMS numbers downgrade to SMS if the other party isn't MMS-capable.
*   Java public APIs that used to take in strings representing phone numbers or parts of phone numbers now take in `CharSequence` instead. This affects `ShortNumberInfo` and `PhoneNumberUtil`.

Heads-up:

*   In `phonenumberutil.h`, we removed most of the `using std::*` statements, leaving only `using std::string`, and changing `phonenumberutil.cc` and `phonenumberutil_test.cc` to prefix `std::` for other usage in the code. If you were relying on these using statements, your build will likely stop compiling. This is not considered a breaking library change since depending on these is not considered good C++ practice, hence our not changing the major version number with this change; however if you were relying on us exporting these symbols, you will have to make similar changes to prefix the relevant std collections appropriately.

*Porters only*:

*   The `is_sms_service` metadata is serialized for the first time in C++ and JS metadata.
*   Documentation update for private variables `VALID_PUNCTUATION` and `SINGLE_INTERNATIONAL_PREFIX`, also renaming the latter from `UNIQUE_INTERNATIONAL_PREFIX`.

*New functionality in this release*:
* Added a new enum for `CountryCodeSource` called `UNSPECIFIED`. This is used as a default value, and will be returned if someone calls `parse()` and then `getCountryCodeSource()` on the result. If users want an actual value for this then they should call `parseAndKeepRawInput()` instead; the values that were previously returned after calling this method will not change.

*Changes affecting porters*:
* `leading_zero_possible` was removed from the metadata and all the places it is referenced in the build and prod code. This will be removed from the metadata proto itself in a subsequent release. This should not affect users of the library - the only place it was used was `FormatInOriginalFormat`, and only initially to try and avoid modifying the input number by removing/adding digits inadvertently. Now this is checked at the end of the method anyway. However slight formatting differences with this method on invalid numbers starting with 0s may be noticed in some countries.
* The possible number pattern has been deleted from the `phonemetadata.proto` file and all generated code. This has not been used for a long time.

Main code changes in this release:


*  isPossibleWithReason now returns the new enums INVALID_LENGTH and
   IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY, where these apply. We hope any users of this method have already updated their code appropriately, as per [this announcement](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/libphonenumber-discuss/sPhYzdzFCmg/6tYsS1f6DgAJ).


A reminder of example changes you might want to make, if they have not been made already:
- If you are calling isPossible, but you only want to accept possible fully-qualified numbers, you may want to switch to isPossibleWithReason and check for IS_POSSIBLE only.
- If you have a switch statement that generates messages based on the result from isPossibleWithReason you should check that these messages are appropriate for the new values as well. More details about these enums in the code, e.g. the[```PhoneNumberUtil``` javadoc](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/29810dcd1b62d430c22587143ab458b4c6a74f74/java/libphonenumber/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/PhoneNumberUtil.java#L444)

New functionality in this release:

- New API methods: isPossibleNumberForType and isPossibleNumberForTypeWithReason, along with getSupportedTypesForRegion and getSupportedTypesForNonGeoEntity. These allow you to query which types (e.g. Mobile) exist for a particular region, and work out if a number is possible for that type (this is a simple length check) rather than for the region as a whole. This allows for more accurate checks than with the existing API isPossibleNumber which considered lengths of all supported types in a region (e.g. mobile, voicemail, fixed-line, etc.).

- isNumberMatch has been improved to better compare numbers which weren't created purely by calling ""parse"" as recommended.
- C++ only changes: the maximum allowed length for a national significant number was increased to 17 for parity with Java, and the method ExactlySameAs to compare two phone number protos was fixed to also consider the number_of_leading_zeros field.

New functionality in this release:
-  New API in ShortNumberUtil to calculate whether a short number is carrier specific or not for a particular region (isCarrierSpecificForRegion). This API should be preferred over the old isCarrierSpecific API, which did not take region into account.

We consider a number to be carrier-specific if it connects to a different endpoint or does not connect at all, depending on the caller's carrier. With the new API a short number that is valid in multiple regions that share a country calling code (e.g. Bermuda and the United States, both of which use the country calling code 1) will now return whether it is carrier-specific or not for the particular region passed in - since it may, for example, be carrier-specific in Bermuda, but not in the United States.

See [detailed release notes](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/release_notes.txt).

**For those who depend on libphonenumber releases from GitHub tags:**
We published and deleted tags named v8.0.1 several times over 11th and 12th January while diagnosing a [Maven issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MRELEASE-812) that had blocked our release.

_What you should do:_
First, determine the impact on your project. The libphonenumber library metadata and code are identical across the different v8.0.1 publications. This probably doesn't affect you if either of the following applies:
-   You didn't pick up the tag on 11th or 12th January.
-   You don't copy or use the `pom.xml` files in any way _and_ you don't care about the timestamp, exact size, and other build-time details of the tag's contents.

If you are affected or have any doubts, please pick up the tag that we published on 13th January, which is stable; and alert your clients and porters about any subsequent action they should take.

Please refer to the [discussion group announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/libphonenumber-discuss/LrTW073URvo) for more details.

_Warning_: this release may break your code unless you update your code at the same time, as it has the following breaking changes:
-   Deleted deprecated methods in ShortNumberInfo that work on strings, instead of phone number objects. These have been marked deprecated for months. Any users of these methods should call PhoneNumberUtil.parse first to create a PhoneNumber object, and pass this in.
-   Support semicolon as extension character while parsing phone numbers. This is not applicable when you are trying to find the phone numbers.
-   Updated JavaScript to throw an error rather than a string. As a result, users doing custom behavior depending on the value of the error must now compare to the value of e.message.

Special note:
- This is our last release of the year. We'll aim to resume releases in the second week of January.

The new release contains mostly [metadata changes](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/FAQ.md#metadata_definition)

Code changes in this release:
- Using new possibleLengthInfo to decide whether a short number is the right
  length or not. This could result in more specific results; whereas before, a
  number from length 3 to length 6 may have been deemed possible, now we may
  exclude a number of length 5.
- Add hash (#) as a diallable character. Numbers with # in them will no longer
  have formatting applied in formatInOriginalFormat, and
  normalizeDiallableCharsOnly now retains the # symbol.
- getExampleNumberForNonGeoEntity has been changed to look at the specific
  number types, not just the generalDesc, for the example numbers; this is a
  necessary change due to changes in the metadata structure, see details for porters below.

Full details in the [release notes](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/release_notes.txt).

Porting or packaging libphonenumber?
There are a series of changes affecting people who port or package libphonenumber. Changes range from how the metadata is organized internally to how releases are tagged.

Please find the new JARs on the maven site [here](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/googlecode/libphonenumber/libphonenumber/7.7.2/).

_Warning_: this release may break your code unless you update your code at the same time, as it has the following breaking changes:
- Calls to `formatNationalNumberWithPreferredCarrierCode`, where `parseAndKeepRawInput` was used to provide the phone number and no carrier code was found, will now use the fallback carrier code. Before we erroneously used an empty string as a carrier code.
- Calls to `formatNumberForMobileDialing` for Brazilian numbers previously produced output for any number, regardless of whether a carrier code was found or not, so long as the number had been obtained with `parseAndKeepRawInput`. Now if no carrier code was found, no output will be produced, because we can't guarantee the number is diallable. If you want to get output regardless, you will need to explicitly set a carrier code for Brazilian numbers if none was present.

You may also need to update any tests that rely on the exact result of parsing a number using `parseAndKeepRawInput`, since the `preferred_domestic_carrier_code` won't be set where it was previously empty.

Full details in the [release notes](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/release_notes.txt), along with information on what metadata has changed.

In light of the fact that this may require changes from clients using these methods to achieve the same behaviour as previous releases, we should have tagged this release as v8.0.0; apologies for this oversight. We hope it won't cause too much inconvenience.

Please find the new JARs on the maven site [here](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/googlecode/libphonenumber/libphonenumber/7.7.0/).

The new release contains only code changes and no [metadata](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/FAQ.md#metadata_definition) changes.

New functionality in this release:
- Removed the dependency on protobuf-javanano from the Java library. This resulted in a minor reduction in the size of the libphonenumber jar. If you added a dependency on protobuf-javanano due to [libphonenumber-7.6.0](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/releases/tag/libphonenumber-7.6.0) it is now safe to remove this dependency.

More details in the [release notes](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/release_notes.txt).

Note if you take advantage of this new functionality by changing your code, it will not necessarily be trivially easy to roll back to a previous version, since you will have to re-add the dependency.

Please find the new JARs on the maven site [here](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/googlecode/libphonenumber/libphonenumber/7.6.0/).

The new release contains [metadata](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/FAQ.md#metadata_definition) changes and some code changes. Upgrading to the latest release is always encouraged since phone number information changes often!

New functionality in this release:
- Use [protobuf-javanano](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/master/javanano) runtime dependencies [from the Maven Repository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.protobuf.nano/protobuf-javanano/3.0.0-alpha-7) in our build. Previously we were packaging these dependencies directly in our jar, which was bad practice and a bad experience for clients*.
  - We hope this is good news for many of you. If this version has unintended consequences please let us know ASAP by reporting an issue on GitHub.
  - For more technical details on what changed, see PR [#1282](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1282).
- Made isNumberGeographical public, and changed the geocoder to use this when checking whether to give a detailed answer or country-level only.

Full details in the [release notes](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/release_notes.txt).

_Warning: If you don't compile your project with protobuf-javanano dependencies_, this release will break your code unless you update your code at the same time. _You need to ensure that you have protobuf-javanano dependencies in your build_. For example, if you compile with Maven, add the following under dependencies:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.protobuf.nano</groupId>
  <artifactId>protobuf-javanano</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0-alpha-7</version>
</dependency>
```

If you have tips on adding this dependency for other build systems, please chime in on [the release announcement thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/libphonenumber-discuss/YzSNYll33Gc)!

_Moreover_, if you _already had_ protobuf-javanano dependencies in your own project, be aware that we stopped renaming Java imports for com.google.protobuf.nano to com.google.i18n.phonenumbers.repackaged.com.google.protobuf.nano in our files.
Repackaging ([PR #1099](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1099)) was a temporary workaround until we removed the dependencies from the jars.

_Finally_, if you take advantage of the new functionality (isNumberGeographical) by changing your code, it will not necessarily be trivially easy to roll back to a previous version.
