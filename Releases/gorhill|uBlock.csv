A new setting has been added in the _Privacy_ section of the _Settings_ pane in the dashboard: ""Block CSP reports"". Default is un-checked. Rationale for this new setting: [issue #3150](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/3150). Documentation for this new setting: [Block CSP reports](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Settings#block-csp-reports).

## Changes

Small improvements to the element picker on touch-aware devices:
- The picker dialog box is now rendered with a minimal width.
- After you pick an element, if the picker dialog box is...
    - Visible...
        - Swiping right will hide it.
    - Not visible...
        - Swiping left or touching it will un-hide it.
        - Swiping right will quit element picker mode.

## Changes:

The filter list category _Social_ has been renamed to broader _Annoyances_.

Changes in selection of stock filter lists:

Added:
- ""Adguard Base Filters""
    - Thanks to Adguard's @ameshkov for [going out of his way to make the list specifically for uBO](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/5138#issuecomment-328883965). Both Adguard and uBO share some extended filter syntax, and as such uBO users do benefit from Adguard's filter lists.
- ""Adguard Spyware Filters"" (in ""Privacy"" section)
- ""Adguard Annoyances"" (in ""Annoyances"" section)
- ""Adguard Spanish/Portuguese"" (see #3089)
- ""VIE: ABPVN"" (see <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/pull/2600>)

Changed:
- Instruction URLs added for ""RUS: RU AdList"" and ""CHN: CJX's EasyList Lite""
    - So that users can find more about these lists and the recommendations on how to best use them made by their respective maintainers.
- ""RUS: Adguard Russian"" and ""CHN: CJX's EasyList Lite"" will now be selected by default for new installations.

Removed:
- ""EasyList without element hiding rules"" (not very useful)
- ""Reek's AAK"" (no longer maintained)
- ""uBlock Protector List"" (it required Chrom[ium|e], uBO must be browser vendor agnostic)
- ""Fanboy Ultimate"" (see #3061)
- ""CHN: CJX's Annoyance"" (optional list)
- ""EU: Prebake"" (no longer maintained)
- ""KOR: Fanboy Korean"" (marked as ""officially unsupported"")
- ""RUS: BitBlock"" (see <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/pull/3019#issuecomment-330076525>)
- ""VIE: Fanboy Vietnamese"" (marked as ""officially unsupported)

For whoever has one of the removed list selected, it will be moved to the ""Custom"" section (i.e. converted into an imported filter list).

## Changes

**Update 2:** ~~Also, there appears to be a [limit to how much data can be stored in indexedDB](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1371255#c21), so if you have many more extra filter lists, not all of them will be able to load, and this can also break the future updating of whichever filter lists could load. In short, total mess. Just as [I feared](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1371255#c16), there are issues with indexedDB.~~ **Wrong, there is no limit** -- I erroneously concluded there was a limit. I can only hypothesize that it I was maybe my network connection which for whatever reason had become less responsive -- and led me to believe I could not add more filter lists.

**Update 3:** Some users are still using Firefox for Android 54. Unfortunately, this version does not have a way to access extension's popup panel or dashboard, this is fixed in Firefox for Android 55. See <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1331742>.

***

### To recover your lost settings:

Due to the many reported issues with the webext-hybrid version of uBO, I am pushing the pure webext version of uBO to AMO. If this causes all your custom settings to be lost, you can recover them by following these steps (two options offered):

#### Option 1

1. Install version 1.13.8: <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/685614/ublock_origin-1.13.8-an+fx+sm+tb.xpi>.
1. Backup all your settings: go to the _Settings_ pane in the dashboard, click on the _""Back up to file""_ button at the bottom.
1. Install latest stable release from AMO: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/>.
1. Restore your settings:  go to the _Settings_ pane in the dashboard, click on the _""Restore from file...""_ button at the bottom.

#### Option 2

**OR**, you still may want to first try the webext-hybrid approach, and maybe the issue affecting lots of users won't affect you:

1. Install version 1.13.10: <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/708468/ublock_origin-1.13.10-an+fx.xpi>.
1. Install latest stable release from AMO: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/>.

***

As required by AMO review process, the Firefox webext[-hybrid] version of uBO will no longer fetch the latest version of [`assets/filters/resources.txt`](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/blob/master/filters/resources.txt) from the project's repository.

The Firefox webext[-hybrid] version of uBO now uses [indexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) to store its cacheable assets<sup>[1]</sup>. There are positive and negative consequences as a result. See issue #2925 for details.

<sub>[1] ""Cacheable assets"" refer to: filter lists downloaded from remote servers; compiled ([pre-parsed](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Launch-and-filter-lists-load-performance)) filter lists; ""selfie"" ([kind of dated doc](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Notes-on-memory-benchmarks,-selfies) but ""selfie"" part is still relevant).</sub>

**Update:** Apparently there are more issues for people using the 32-bit version of Firefox. See <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1371255#c21>. Please report such issues to Firefox devs, there is nothing I can do.

***

**Important:** If you are having issue with uBO being irremediably broken with the 1.13.10 update, try:

1. Un-install uBO
1. Quit Firefox (be sure Firefox is really no longer in memory)
1. Launch Firefox
1. Verify that uBO is really removed in `about:addons`, otherwise, go to step 1.
1. Quit Firefox (be sure Firefox is really no longer in memory)
1. Launch Firefox
1. Re-install uBO
1. Don't as me why, I don't know. See issue #2909 / <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1372750> (reportedly fixed in Firefox 56).

If this still does not work, you will have to fall back to re-installing 1.13.8 (legacy version), possibly after repeating the steps above, except step that install 1.13.8 at step 7.

Direct link to 1.13.8: <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/685614/ublock_origin-1.13.8-an+fx+sm+tb.xpi>.

Once you installed 1.13.8 above, you will have to choose one of two options:

1. Backup all your settings, then install the pure webext version of uBO from the dev channel on AMO, which is not affected by the root issue. Here is a direct link to that version: <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/709305/ublock_origin-1.13.11rc0-an+fx.xpi>. Once you have installed the pure webext version, restore your settings from the backup file.

OR

2. Keep using 1.13.8 until Firefox 56 (in which the root issue is fixed). If you choose this option, you should probably disable the auto-update for uBO. For Android, there is a setting to disable auto-update of extensions, but it applies to all extensions: `about:config` => `extensions.autoupdate.enabled` => `false`.

***

This is the webext-hybrid version of uBlock Origin to be published on AMO. It's still is marked as ""Legacy"" in Firefox because of the data migration legacy code present, so as to seamlessly migrate your settings from legacy storage to webext storage.

See [Firefox WebExtensions documentation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Firefox-WebExtensions) for **up to date** information regarding the uBO/webext[-hybrid].

### Stock filter lists

I added code to enable me to remove stock filter lists in a seamless way for users. There are a couple of stock filter lists I wish to remove (because no longer maintained), but I refrain from doing so because it would be rude to remove a stock filter list which might be enabled for some users out there. The added code will convert removed stock filter lists which are enabled into imported filter lists, so that no change occurs in the resulting filterset from a user's point of view.

### Firefox WebExtensions

I plan to push the webext-hybrid version of uBO into uBO’s dev channel on AMO as soon as 1.13.8 is published. I don’t think the webext-hybrid qualifies as a webext, but is a necessary step to migrate user data seamlessly.

### Chromium-based browsers

- [Inconvenient default hotkey mapping activation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2723)
    - Reportedly, the default keyboard shortcut I picked do not work for all locales. Consequently I removed default shortcuts and users will have to pick whatever work for them.
    - **Important:** For those already affected by the issue, the suggested shortcuts were already added and won't be removed with this update. You will have to remove or re-assign yourself by clicking _""Keyboard shortcuts""_ link in the page `chrome://extensions` -- the link is at the bottom of the page.

**P.S.:** Such an issue should never have made it to the release version. The fact that it did means nobody is testing the dev build, or nobody using the dev build reported the issue. It's completely unrealistic to expect me alone to find all such issues. Given the nature of this project, you will have to accept for such quirks to happen if you are not willing to contribute by using the dev build and reporting such issues. **TL;DR:** Contribute by installing and using the dev build.

### Google Chrome, with uBO installed from Chrome store

- [The extension is disabled in chrome](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2722)
    - More specifically, this is due to a Chromium bug, see <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2720#issuecomment-309988605>.
    - Chromium bug: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=720597>.
    - As reported by users, if you click _Repair_, you will lose all your settings in uBO, see <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2720#issuecomment-310056152>.
    - Consequently, [force an update of the extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2720#issuecomment-310053200), do not click _""Repair""_ -- my understanding so far is that forcing an update will not cause all your uBO settings to be lost.
    - 1.13.0 had been released to only 20% of all Chrome store users.
    - In the unfortunate event all your uBO settings were lost, you will have to [restore them](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Settings#backuprestore-section).

### New static network filter option: `csp=`

This new filter option allows to inject any Content Security Policy header in pages matching the filter. See <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1930#issuecomment-301052117> for discussion about the rationale behind this new filter option.

Some existing filters may be converted internally to `csp=`-based filters by uBO. For example, a filter such as `|blob:$script,[...]` will be converted to `*$csp=script-src 'self' * data: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval',[...]`, in order to enforce the blocking of `blob:`-based URIs for scripts, something otherwise not possible through the `chrome.webRequest` API.

### Element zapper

Ability to zap DOM elements on the current page:

![a](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/585534/26530837/b51a874a-43aa-11e7-8512-0927be4d8992.png)

The purpose is to quickly deal with the removal of nuisance elements on a page **without** having to create one or more filters: [see documentation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Element-zapper).

### Support for keyboard shortcuts

Features which can be launched using a keyboard shortcut:
- Enter element zapper mode: default to <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd>.
- Enter element picker mode: default to <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>X</kbd>.
- Open logger: default to <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>L</kbd>

#### For Chromium or WebExtension-compatible browsers

> **Update:** Default keyboard shortcuts have been removed for Chromium-based browsers, because of issue #2723. You will have to bind your own shortcuts, as the default ones choosen originally (above) interfere with proper keyboard usage in some locales.

You can re-configure the shortcuts through the browser API. For Chromium-based browsers, go to `chrome://extensions`, scroll down then click on _""Keyboard shortcuts""_. I suppose this depends of the browser, you will have to investigate.

#### For Firefox (non-webext version)

You can re-configure the default shortcuts for the above commands by opening `about:config` and filtering with `extensions.ublock0`. The default shortcuts are built-in, if you want to re-defined or un-set them, you will have to create the entries:

- `extensions.ublock0.shortcuts.launch-element-zapper`
- `extensions.ublock0.shortcuts.launch-element-picker`
- `extensions.ublock0.shortcuts.launch-logger`

To disable a built-in shortcut, set the value to `-`.

To reset to a default shortcut, reset the corresponding entry in `about:config`.

These `about:config` shortcut values are read only at launch time, so you will have to restart uBO for the changes to take effect.

## Changes

### Some refactoring work of static filtering engine

- to be more modular and hence make it easier to extent filter syntax
- to lessen overhead overall
- to address #2598, #2630
- to extend filter syntax to support `csp=` filter option.

This is an important refactoring. At first my intention was to add support for `csp=` filter syntax, but this required some refactoring, and while at it I decided to address a lot of other details regarding static filtering engine which I meant to address since a while, hence the extent of the changes to the code.

As a result, I have observed that baseline memory footprint of uBO itself is 5-6 MB less with  1.13.0 compared to 1.12.4 on both Chromium and Firefox (Linux 64-bit, default uBO settings).

### Improved compatibility with Adguard's filter lists

See #2624. I do plan to add Adguard's English filter lists to uBO's stock filter lists for the next stable release. 

Given that both Adguard and uBO support advanced filter syntax not supported by ABP (which advanced syntax benefit end users and make a filter list maintainer's life easier), and given that EasyList maintainers are limiting themselves to support no more than what ABP can support, enabling Adguard's filter lists as default list in their respective locale is something I am considering.

New static network filter option: `badfilter`. Using this option will prevent another filter to be loaded in memory. See <https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/192> for rationale for having such a filter option.

### Chromium/Firefox WebExtension

Ability to support more request types from webRequest API: `csp-report`, `font`, `media`, `websocket`, and actually whatever is part of [webRequest.ResourceType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/ResourceType). This means uBO will be able to natively filter websocket connection attempts starting with Chromium 58.

### Firefox

The webext version for Firefox has been converted into a [hybrid version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Embedded_WebExtensions), to allow seamless migration of uBO's settings/data from a legacy extension to webext extension. I consider this webext version of uBO to be fit to release to AMO if the current stable Firefox version (52) supported all the proper WebExtensions API required by uBO. All the [blocking issues](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1309926) have been resolved, but the fixes will be available in a future stable version of Firefox.

**Update:** due to [auto-update snafu](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2454), the webext version of uBO has been given a different id than the official one, this will guarantee that auto-update won't cause issue (you will have to update manually if using the webext version).

**Important:** If you install the webext version of uBO (you need the most recent build of Nightly), this is what will happen:

When you launch uBO/webext for the first time, it will read all your settings/data from the old storage and migrate them to the new webext storage. This happens **only** if uBO/webext can find a [file named `ublock0.sqlite`](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/dist/README.md#firefox). This will happens only once, the first time you install uBO/webext. Depending of how much data there is to migrate, this may cause your browser to work hard during that first launch and delay readiness.

Once the data from the uBO/legacy has been migrated to uBO/webext, each version of uBO will only see its own data, meaning no change in settings in one version will be seen by the other version. If you remove uBO/webext, this also removes the storage associated to it, meaning re-installing uBO/webext following removal will cause the storage migration code to kick in again.

Asset managements was refactored: [details](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/pull/2314).

The user interface of the _""3rd-party filters""_ pane has been revisited:
- To render better in devices with smaller screen.
- Clicking _""Update now""_ is no longer a blocking operation.
- The home icon is a link to the support site for a given filter list.
- The clock icon replaces the _""purge cache""_ label.
  - Click to mark a filter list as out-of-date.
- The custom filter lists input field has been repurposed to _import_ external filter lists, as opposed to _declare_ external filter lists as was the case before.
  - An imported filter list will have an _X_ icon aside its name, to be used to remove the custom filter list.
- You can now hide unused filter lists by clicking the global filter count at the top.

Procedural cosmetic filters can now be chained and recursive ([something which was planned](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1930#issuecomment-242053806)) .

New procedural cosmetic filter operators:
- `:has-text(argument)`: to filter elements according to whether they have a specific text string found in them. Use `/.../` to match a literal regular expression instead of plain text.
- `:if()`/`:if-not(argument)`: use to implement recursion, `argument` is itself a valid procedural cosmetic filter, but can also be a plain CSS selector.

The cost of parsing procedural cosmetic filters has been moved from content script-time to filter list compile-time, i.e. done only once when a filter list is updated.

[Documentation about procedural cosmetic filters](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Procedural-cosmetic-filters) has been updated.

The element picker supports all procedural cosmetic filters, i.e. it will also provide visual feedback as you enter manually such filters in the input field. Invalid filters, procedural or not, will be labelled with a bright red `E`.

#### Cosmetic filtering

Implementation of cosmetic filter operator `:matches-css` has been revised according to the discussion at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1930#issuecomment-241997548 and request in https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/212:
- `:matches-css` now accept no more than one single style property. If more than one style property must be matched on the same node, you will need to chain them (i.e. `div##matches-css(...):matches-css(...)` -- ability to chain is coming for next release). Since there is only one style property, do not use trailing `;`.
- `:matches-css-before()` and `:matches-css-after()` are now also available to specifically match style property for the pseudo elements `:before` and `:after` on a node.
- Support the use of regexes for property matching: if the first and last character of the value to match is `/`, the value will be deemed to be a literal regular expression which must be matched.

#### Dashboard

The last dashboard's pane you visited will be automatically opened next time you open the dashboard ([issue #2206](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2206)).

### Dynamic filtering pane

The dynamic filtering pane in the popup panel is now available in read-only mode to users who did not enable _""I am an advanced user""_ in _Settings_:

![Dynamic filtering pane in read-only mode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/585534/20142632/9869bf24-a663-11e6-9189-02a470f95a96.png)

The rationale for this change is explained in [issue 2010](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2010). It still is collapsed by default, but can be brought up by clicking the _""requests blocked""_ or _""domains connected""_ fields in the main area.

### Template-based scriptlets

In order to promote the reuse of [injectable scriplets](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#scriptinject) across different sites, it is now possible for a scriptlet to accept arguments. The arguments are comma-separated and appear after the token, for example ([a real case](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/184)):

```
golem.de##script:inject(abort-on-property-write.js, _sp_)
```

In the example above, the scriplet `abort-on-property-write.js` contains a placeholder for one argument, which placeholder will be replaced with the argument `_sp_`. Placeholders for scriplets which accept arguments will _always_ be for string values (reminder that injectable scriplets are [part of the project](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/blob/master/filters/resources.txt), never from an external party).

### Advanced settings

A new _""Advanced settings""_ pane, available only to advanced users. It contains settings which are experimental, or which are of interest to advanced users who want more control over how uBO behaves internally. I do not want to bloat the _Settings_ pane in the dashboard with settings which are of interest only to a minority of users or which are experimental: this is where the new _""Advanced settings""_  pane is useful.

When you enabled _""Advanced users""_ in the _Settings_ pane, a _cogs_ icon will appear next to that setting. Click this _cogs_ icon to access those ""hidden"" advanced settings:

![the _cogs_ icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/585534/20042797/2800dcd4-a44e-11e6-9bc8-a5e0c960262c.png)

The UI of the advanced settings page is purposefully stern. Keep in mind that whatever settings you see in there may be experimental and could be removed at any time in the future.

Experimental advanced setting of interest: `suspendTabsUntilReady` (default to `false`), to prevent uBO from establishing any remote connection at launch before all filter lists/settings have been fully loaded (related issue #1327). How well it works will have to be evaluated by users.

### WebExtensions

From now on, there will be a Firefox's WebExtension version of uBO (see `uBlock0.webext.zip` below, see [_""Temporary Installation in Firefox""_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) on how to install on Firefox). Do not bother trying it out if you do not have Nightly 52.0a1 (2016-10-29) or later installed. Also, do not open issues here for the WebExtension version of uBO -- it is still at an experimental stage and there are things which are known to be missing in the API for uBO to fully function: see [bugzilla 13099260](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1309926).

Some work has been done on the element picker:
- can now handle procedural cosmetic filters (`:has`, `matches-css`, `:xpath`), and also the special operator `:style` -- matching elements of such filters will be highlighted like normal CSS selector-based filters.
- an invalid filter in the input field will now trigger a visual cue: the background of the input field will be reddish.
- the number of elements on the current page matching the filter in the input field is now displayed in the bottom right corner of the input field.
- the preview mode is now sticky, i.e. you can modify the filter in the input field without being kicked out of preview mode. Convenient when creating `:style`-based cosmetic filters.

The _Privacy_ setting _""Disable hyperlink auditing/beacon""_ has been changed to _""Disable hyperlink auditing""_, and network requests of type `beacon` are no longer blanket-blocked. The network requests of type `beacon` will now be filtered just like any other network requests, according to the current filters/rules. [need to update wiki doc].

Network requests of type `csp_report` will be blocked regardless of filters/rules when there is a probability they are fired as a result of uBO internally redirecting one or more network requests to neutered resources. In such case, uBO considers these `csp_report` network requests as ""spurious"" and blocks them. An example of such spurious CSP reports being fired as a result of uBO redirecting resources is `https://medium.com/` (see dev console when loading a page from that site), where a CSP report is fired by the browser as a result of uBO redirecting Google Analytics script to uBO's neutered version.

Core code related to static and cosmetic engines has been refactored to take advantage of ES6 [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)/[Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) (related issue: #1070). Polyfilled versions of Set/Map are provided for compatibility with Chromium 37 and less<sup>[1]</sup>, and for Pale Moon 26 and earlier<sup>[2]</sup>. While at it, I also revisited some of the inner-most loops executed at load time to remove other observed overheads in profiling results.

[Benchmarks shows](https://gorhill.github.io/obj-vs-set-vs-map/) that there are good gains to be had in performance and memory efficiency when using ES6 Set/Map. The performance gains are especially true when dealing with collections with a lot of _misses_, which is typical of the static and cosmetic filtering engines ni uBO.

Following the above refactoring, profiling Chromium/Firefox, I observed:
- Non-selfie case: uBO will roughly load in about half the time, because:
  - Using ES6 `Set` and `Map` instead of `Object`
  - No longer using `String.split` to split lines into fields = less memory allocations = less work for garbage collector
- Selfie-case: there is a marginal performance improvement at most in boot time -- make sense since a selfie is just a no-parsing-at-all load mechanism regardless of how the data is represented internally.

Cosmetic filtering operator `matches-css()`, to remove any DOM element which matches specific CSS properties (see https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/84).

- [Bug 1232354 - uBlock Origin makes the loading of a long page hang the content process ](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1232354)
  - The issue is not specific to uBO, it likely affects any extension which implements `shouldLoad()`.
  - The person who reported the bug would have found many other extensions being worst than uBO (including BluHell at 20s).
  - I could find a sensible work around for the `shouldLoad()` issue for uBO though, as explained in the bug comments.
  - Though the code change obviously benefits the specific test case in the bug report, it will lower the overhead uBO add to web pages in general in Firefox (e10s enabled or not).

3788244,2016-08-01T21:41:58Z,2016-08-01T21:42:30Z,,"### New:

New cosmetic filtering operators: `:has()`, `:xpath()`, `:style()`. See detailed documentation at [_""Static filter syntax""_](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#has).

These new operators are to be used only for cosmetic filtering cases which are hard to crack -- more and more of these are surfacing (for example DOM elements with random class or id values).

When it comes to cosmetic filtering, preferably, always favor a plain old CSS3-based cosmetic filter, since they can be used in a declarative way, inside a `style` tag. But there are cases where no CSS3-based expression will work, and in such case consider these new `:has` and `:xpath` operators.

Note that unlike `:has`,  `:xpath` is not a valid CSS4 expression, so they will always be enforced in a non-declarative way (in other word, javascript is doing the filtering, through [`document.evaluate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate)).

These new cosmetic filtering operators can be ""excepted"" like any other standard CSS3-based cosmetic filter using the usual `#@#` prompt. Such exception cosmetic filters do not have to be _specific_ however, i.e. you do not have to associate them to a specific hostname/entity.

---

### Changes

The content script code responsible to implement cosmetic filtering has been re-factored:
- To harden against sites which tries to work around uBO's cosmetic filtering.
- To improve general performance and memory usage.
- To support the new cosmetic filters.

#### Chromium-based browsers

No significant change: I just tidied up changes made for the emergency fix released as 1.7.2. Now-unused code paths related to WebSocket wrapper code have been removed (they were bypassed in 1.7.2).

#### Chromium-based browsers only

**Emergency fix:** removed WebSocket support for the time being (#1604):
- I overestimated the number of people using the dev build of uBO -- and as a consequence assumed that any issue would have been reported prior to release.
- I underestimated the use of WebSocket in the field -- turns out it's used way more than expected.

Sorry for the unexpected breakage.

Ideally, fixing the root issue would be best -- maybe [starring the issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=129353) will make it more likely to be fixed sooner than later.

**Update:** There is now a companion extension for uBlock Origin, which will restore the ability of uBlock Origin to see/filter WebSocket connection attempts: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin-websocket/pgdnlhfefecpicbbihgmbmffkjpaplco.

##### Element picker

The element picker has been beefed-up:
- It will now offer as filter choice background images, if any. (#1202)
- When you click on an element on the page, it will report _all_ elements found under the mouse.
  - Previously, the picker would report filters only for the element clicked and its ancestors.
- Filters for media elements will now be offered, if any. (#1545)
- You can now preview the effect of the selected filter on the page. (#650)

##### Chromium-based browsers

It is now possible to block websocket connections for Chromium-based browsers. ([Chromium issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=129353), #956, #1497):

![a](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/585534/14825534/58d43d36-0ba8-11e6-99f5-effabebc546d.png)

Ability to filter websocket connections like any other network requests will take care of a new breed of ad-delivery techniques seen on more and more sites, and currently existing protocol-independent filters in filter lists will take care to filter out many of these websocket connections just like they did for http/https connections. For those wholesale-blocking 3rd parties on a site, websocket connections to 3rd-party servers will no longer escape the block.

Examples of cases solved by the ability to filter websocket connections with no need for special filters:
- https://forums.lanik.us/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=30068&p=92706
- https://forums.lanik.us/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=29304&p=91894

A general observation though, is that webscokets are more and more used: you will spot their use on sites such as GitHub, New York Times, etc.

Making uBO aware of websocket connections allows it to report these (previously invisible<sup>[1]</sup>) connections to the user, through the logger or through the dynamic filtering pane in the popup panel.

From now on, uBlock Origin will pull assets (filter lists, scriptlets) from a project dedicated strictly for the purpose of maintaining those resources: [uBlockOrigin/uAssets](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets). Notice that this project is owned by _uBlockOrigin_, an organization I created to maintain all things related to uBlock Origin, uMatrix. For now uAssets is the first project to be held under that organization.

The goal of [uBlockOrigin/uAssets](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) is to receive all the reports for the need of new filters, or reports of web pages broken by existing filters, and will be open for people to contribute (i.e. given write permissions on the project).

Popup filters can also be used to filter popunders. This was the case in the original implementation of popunder filtering, however this was removed eventually as this was causing too many false positives for popunders, causing legitimate tabs to be closed (#1010). The new solution is to still filter popunders according to existing popup filters, but to disregard popup filters which are too broad. Cases for which a popunder cannot be taken care by an existing popup filter, an explicit `popunder` filter should be used.

##### Ability to set the default state of per-site switches (issue #1193)

It is now possible to set the default value of [per-site switches](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Per-site-switches) from the _Settings_ pane in the dashboard, under the _Default behavior_ header (see figure below). It was possible before to modify the default setting, but this had to be done by manually entering the proper rule in the _My rules_ pane -- not very suitable to non-advanced users.

##### Block media elements by size (issue #1163)

This is a new per-site switch:

![Block-by-size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/popup-1h.png)

Primary purpose is to save bandwidth. See [documentation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Per-site-switches#no-large-media-elements) for more information.

Note that this feature has been implemented with the utmost care to not add overhead to those not using it. The content scripts to handle interaction with blocked media elements are injected _if and only if_ large media elements were actually blocked.

More specifically, this allows to defeat AdDefend- or Yavli-based ads on many sites (as of writing), which so far were defeated only through inline script tag filtering -- so this means that now Chromium-based browsers can also bypass AdDefend/Yavli (for example, see #1100). Some documentation available [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#special-cosmetic-filters) (will eventually create a dedicated page).

##### Ability to use Adguard filter lists

You can now directly use [Adguard filter lists](https://adguard.com/en/filters.html). Filters which use Adguard-specific filter syntax extension will simply be discarded by uBO. If you want to use an Adguard filter list, you will have to import it as an [external filter list](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists-from-around-the-web#import-external-filter-lists).

##### Popunders

A new filter type is introduced: `popunder`. This gives uBlock Origin the ability to block popunders. Popunders are when a web page opens new legitimate content in another tab or window, while at the same time loading nuisance content in the current tab. They are essentially the reverse of what is happening with nuisance popups, where the nuisance content is opened in a new tab or window.

Since the `popunder` option is specific to uBO, any instance of sites using popunders will have to be reported [here](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues) so that filters can be crafted to address the issue for those sites.

##### Redirection infrastructure

Consider this still experimental. This adds the option to map blocked network requests to uBO-provided resources. Specifically, this solves issue raised in #949/#1043 -- and more generally consider this yet another tool in uBO's arsenal to enforce users' choices.

The library of resources which are used for redirection is -- and will always be completely under control of uBO, this is not something under the control of any 3rd parties. This ensures only safe resources are used for redirection.

It could be said this feature is vaguely similar to [NoScript's surrogates](https://forums.informaction.com/viewforum.php?f=26), except that in the case of uBO it's network redirection to plainly map one resource into another one, and it can be used for any kind of resource, not just scripts (anything which can be represented with a `data:` URI).

Only blocked network requests are candidates for redirection.

To create a redirection filter, just add the `redirect=[...]` filter option to it, like so:

```
||example.com/badimage.*$image,redirect=2x2-transparent.png
```

The `[...]` is a token identifying the resource to which to redirect: it must be a resource which appears in the [resource library](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/blob/master/filters/resources.txt). With the example filter above, a web page will not see that the resource was blocked.

For the `redirect=` filter option to be taken into account, some conditions must be met by the static filter, for efficiency purpose. The static filter ...
- must be hostname-anchored, i.e. starts with `||`.
- must have one type specified -- negated types are not valid.
- must have a redirect token which identifies an existing resource in the resource library.

If at least one of the above conditions is not met, no redirection will take place, though the filter will still block matching network requests.

Example of cases solved by the `redirect` filter option:
- Ads in video: http://www.chip.de/news/Halbvoll-in-2-Minuten-Huawei-zeigt-neue-Superakkus_85752247.html
- Site detects blocker: http://dayt.se/

New cosmetic filter to foil specific inline script tags -- one more tool in uBlock Origin's arsenal against bloat. Syntax of this new cosmetic filter is:

```
example.com##script:contains(...)
```

Where `...` is a plain string or a regular expression. If `...` is a string in between `/` like `/.../`, the string is treated as a literal javascript regular expression, otherwise it is treated as a plain string.

Caveats of current implementation:
- The filter must apply to a specific hostname or entity. Generic script tag filters will be rejected.
- This **works only on not too old versions of Firefox**: this feature makes use of the [`beforescriptexecute` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/beforescriptexecute), and this event is [not supported on Chromium-based browsers](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5711871906676736).
  - Starring the [related Chromium issue](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=168175) may motivate developers to bring support of `beforescriptexecute` to Chromium.

Excellent example of the usefulness of this new cosmetic filter:
- Enable _""DEU: EasyList Germany‎""_ in _3rd-party filters_ pane in the dashboard.
- Go to http://www.focus.de/.
- See site purposefully defacing itself with obnoxious click-bait ads.
- Go to _My filters_ pane in the dashboard.
- Add custom cosmetic filter `www.focus.de##script:contains(uabInject)`.
- Reload http://www.focus.de/.
- No more obnoxious click-bait ads.
- Another example: `explosm.net##script:contains(/^__durl=/)` for http://explosm.net/.

Blocking inline script tags for that site would prevent site-defacing ads from appearing, but this is a broad approach which can result in other useful functionality on the site being disabled as well. The new script tag cosmetic filter syntax allows a more refined approach by blocking one or more specific inline script tags on a page. Blocking all inline script is preferred if this does not lead to the site losing useful functionalities. But if this happens, a specific script tag filter is the solution.

#### New:

##### Support for cloud storage ([wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Cloud-storage))

Related issues: #80, https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/126.

I consider the new feature to be early development, a lot more testing by more users will tell how well it works. Please refrain from filing feature requests related to cloud storage unless it's a severe usability issue for everybody.

##### Dashboard: _Revert_ buttons

_Revert_ buttons have been added to the _My filters_ and _Whitelist_ panes in the dashboard. I figured this was needed with the new ability to import data from cloud storage.

##### All non-default 3rd-party filter lists are no longer part of the package

The only 3rd-party filter lists which are part of the package are the ones which are selected by default in uBlock:
- EasyList
- EasyPrivacy
- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list‎
- Malware Domain List‎
- Malware domains‎

If you had any other stock filter lists selected, the change should be seamless, _except_ for the filter lists which have been removed from the stock filter lists, because there were no longer maintained, and/or of dubious quality:
- ESP: Filtros Nauscopicos
- ROU: RO-LIST

If you want to keep using these removed filter lists, you will have to import them as external filter lists.

The conversion of non-default stock filter lists into external stock filter lists allowed to reduce uBlock Origin's package size from ~3.6 MB to less than 1.5 MB.

**CAVEAT:** if you were importing as custom filter list a filter list which was already available in the stock filter lists, you will now have to select the appropriate stock filter list. Trying to import as custom filter list a filter list which is already available in the stock filter lists won't work: uBlock Origin will refuse to import a custom filter list which is already available in the stock filter  lists. Sorry for the inconvenience. (issues #668, #669).

##### Firefox
- _""Speculative pre-connections""_ will now also be disabled when the option _""Disable pre-fetching""_ is checked. More info:

  - Side-effect of the fix: network filters which apply to many hostnames (through the `domain=` filter option) will no longer be ""decomposed"" into one-filter-instance-per-hostname, there is now one filter instance for all the listed hostnames.
  - User-side this means:
    - The logger will report the long version of the original filter: `||example.com^$domain=a.com|b.com|c.com`.
    - The filter count reported in the _3rd-party filters_ pane will be lower than it used to be.
  - Performance-wise, I expect this is a marginal improvement (i.e. unnoticeable by any user) -- especially for those filter instances with large list of hostnames in their `domain=` option<sup>[1]</sup>.

- New wiki page for easy subscription to a choice of filter lists
  - Here: [Filter lists from around the web](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists-from-around-the-web)
- You can open the logger in its own separate window when opened from the popup UI **with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key pressed**.
- Ability to strict-block using finer-grained filters, rather than just whole sites:
  - Use the `document` option: means strict-block whole page.
    - To reiterate: exception filters with the `document` option are still discarded by uBlock.
  - Permanently disabling strict-blocking is still on a per-site basis though, by design.

##### New logger tool

A new DOM inspector tool can be accessed from the logger (the `</>` button), to assist in the creation of cosmetic filters, including the ability to interactively create exception cosmetic filters (a long missing ability):

![a](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/585534/8460038/546b7bc4-1fef-11e5-8e47-069448631bad.png)

Roughly:
- Click on an element to hide it
- Click on a cosmetic filter (red) to unhide the element(s) affected by it

Once you are satisfied with the result, click the _save_ icon to commit your changes. This will open a modal dialog box which will show you the resulting list of cosmetic filters, and all the elements which are affected by those will be highlighted on the page: red = will be hidden as a result, green = will no longer be hidden as a result.

You can further manually edit the listed filters, and the page will show the result live. So if you end up creating an invalid filter, this will be reflected in the page which will show nothing highlighted.

Once you click _create_, these filters are now part of your custom filters.

Click the _eraser_ to reset all changes to the page, i.e. any selected elements or cosmetic filters will be _un-clicked_ in the inspector.

That new feature is part of the logger, hence all this new code is loaded in memory if and only if the logger is opened.

##### [UI in the logger](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger#static-filtering) to assist in creating static filters.

Related issue: https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/68.

![c](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/585534/8037377/6ed2d4d4-0dcb-11e5-826c-e5109f72b86b.png)

##### A new per-site switch to disable remote fonts

![c](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/585534/8084792/f5756be2-0f5a-11e5-809d-c309db2a2216.png)

""Side-effect"" is to fix issue #15:
- Simply add the rule `no-remote-fonts: * true` to _""My rules""_, and remote fonts from everywhere will be blocked by default -- yet uBlock will still be able to use its FontAwesome font from its package.
- As a opposed to using a browser setting to disable remote fonts, you can enable remote fonts on a per-site basis -- so disabling remote fonts is no longer an all or nothing choice.

The number of times a page did or did try to download remote fonts appears as a badge aside the switch.

**Caveat:** Chromium's webRequest API [does not specifically report requests of type `font`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/webRequest#type-ResourceType), fonts are reported as type `other`. Whether a request is for a font resource is inferred by uBlock using the ""extension"" of the path part of a URL. However a URL can be anything really, regardless of request type, so for Chromium-based browsers, uBlock **may** have to block a font **after** the request is made, when the response headers are received from the remote server -- as the response headers allow to identify for sure the type of a resource.

##### Ability to find out from which filter lists a static filter originates:

Related issue: #58.

![c](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/585534/8112038/45e8dcd4-1033-11e5-8e93-1475d02bf6f4.png)

Can be accessed from the logger: if a static filter is present in the 3rd-column of a row, clicking on the cell will show the filter list(s) in which the filter can be found.

There is a resource cost to reverse lookup filter lists from a filter, but this is mitigated by implementing the reverse lookup as a standalone ""service"", which is launched **if and only if** an actual reverse lookup is requested.

Since reverse lookup is potentially CPU intensive (depending on number of lists, size of lists), the lookup is performed from within a [Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers), i.e. its own dedicated thread:

![c](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/585534/8129341/5d42c496-10d6-11e5-880f-71bea5943cda.png)<br><sup>Resource cost while reverse lookup service is alive: 6.5 MB on [Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/). It's because all the stored compiled version of filter lists in use must be kept in live memory to perform the lookup efficiently.</sup>

The reverse lookup ""service"" will shutdown itself after being idle for a set time (currently 11 minutes), so that the extra resources used are freed.

---

##### Strict blocking will now show you which filter list(s) caused a document to be blocked:

Related issue: #298.

![c](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/585534/8130396/d82fb2d2-10df-11e5-88d0-e5bfd5f8c75c.png)

This is accomplished by using the reverse lookup feature described above.

---

##### Filter lists with special instructions for proper usage

Related issue: #312.

Some filter lists require extra steps for proper usage. Those filter lists are now identified with a special icon, which links to instructions on how to use the filter list:

#### Changes

Issue #59 was fixed as a side-effect of some specific re-factoring related to how the static filtering engine returns results -- a necessary step toward fixing other future issues. The effect of this specific re-factoring:
- The logger will now report accurately the static (atomic) filter which affects a network request. For examples:
  - The `third-party` filter option is now reported if present (it wasn't before).
  - If a filter applies to a specific request type, this is now reported (it wasn't before).
  - If a filter applies to a specific domain, this is now always reported (it wasn't always before).
- Some overhead removed from the static filtering engine for when the logger is not opened.
  - Previously, uBlock was returning a string representation of a filter in case of match, even if that (inaccurate) string representation was not going to be used in the logger. This does not happen anymore.

Firefox support for browser settings has been added, so now the new privacy settings in the _Settings_ pane are also effective in Firefox.

A new privacy setting has been added:

```
[ ] Disable hyperlink auditing/beacon
```

Checked by default. [Background information regarding hyperlink auditing](http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/hyperlink-auditing-aka-a-ping-and-beacon-aka-navigator-sendbeacon.364904/).

Note that with Chromium, hyperlink auditing is enabled by default, and there is no UI in the browser setting pages to disable it. Now there is with uBlock. (**edit:** ok, [there is a sort of UI](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/288), not exactly user friendly and upfront though.)

With the following steps I can have Google generate a `ping` request, so I use these to validate that the disabling of hyperlink auditing works:
- Open the logger, select _Behind the scene_ scope.
- In Google, search `buy iphone`.
- Find a link to `bestbuy.com` in the links offered as result (I get one to `bestbuy.ca`).
- Click that link.
- If hyperlink auditing is not disabled, you should see a behind-the-scene request to `google.*`.

The setting will also affect whether `navigator.sendBeacon` is enabled/disabled. You can see these behind-the-scene requests while navigating Gihub (`https://www.google-analytics.com/collect`). Unfortunately, it does not seem possible at this time to disable `navigator.sendBeacon` in Chromium.

Most of the work for this version are for Firefox, but I will publish this version only in the Chrome store, as the new setting:

[  ] _Disable pre-fetching (to prevent any connection for blocked network requests)_

... is only functional for the Chromium version. I need to read more to hook it properly for Firefox. That new setting is checked by default. It is suggested you read _Chrome Help_'s [_Make webpages load faster_](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1385029):

> If you turn this setting on in Chrome, websites (and any of their embedded resources) that are prerendered or prefetched may set and read their own cookies as if you had visited them before -- even if you don’t visit the prerendered or prefetched pages after all.

Note that pre-fetching is more of a crutch to speed up page load, using a blocker in the first place is [what really improve page load time](http://monica-at-mozilla.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/tracking-protection-for-firefox-at-web.html), without sacrificing privacy like pre-fetching does. Aside the privacy implication of pre-fetching, it certainly does not come for free either resource-wise (bandwidth, memory, cpu). In any case, your choice, so long as you can make an informed one (that _pre-fetching_ setting, enabled be default, and its negative implication privacy-wise are not exactly disclosed upfront).

#### Closed as fixed:

##### Chromium:
- [[Chrom*] connections not being blocked after reload](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues/234) (from uMatrix)
  - uBlock now requires a new permission, _""Change your privacy-related settings""_:  for uBlock to be able to disable the setting _""Prefetch resources to load pages more quickly""_.
  - This will ensure no connection is opened **at all** for blocked requests: **It's for your own protection privacy-wise**.
  - [_Prefetching_](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1385029) is under _Privacy_ for good reasons: using prefetching has negative implications privacy-wise.
  - For pages with lots for blocked requests, this will actually remove overhead from page load (if you did not have the setting already disabled).
  - When uBlock blocks a network request, the expectation is that it blocks **completely** the connection, hence the new permission is necessary for uBlock to do **truthfully** what it says it does.

uBlock's primary purpose is to block **network connections**, not just data transfer. Not blocking the connection while just blocking the data transfer would mean uBlock is lying to users. So this permission will stay, and sorry for those who do not understand that it actually allows uBlock to do its intended job more thoroughly. A blocker which does not thoroughly prevent connections is not a real blocker.

**Privacy Badger also requires exactly the same permissions.** I want uBlock to also serve privacy-minded users first.

If _prefetching_ had been disabled by default, this new permission would not be needed, but _prefetching_ is unfortunately enabled by default, and under _Privacy_ heading, which is itself hidden by default under _""advanced settings""_.

[Google on prefetching:](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1385029)

> If you turn this setting on in Chrome, websites (and any of their embedded resources) that are prerendered or prefetched may set and read their own cookies as if you had visited them before -- even if you don’t visit the prerendered or prefetched pages after all.

Also, the benefits of _prefetching_ are probably marginal, and in the context of a blocker, the benefits could be negative, since a lot of useless connections would be made, just to be discarded after the browser find out the requests won't be made anyway. So do not fall for the _""lost of major performance boost""_ claim I read elsewhere, this is just a silly and baseless claim.

**Edit:** next release there will be a setting [allowing you to re-enable prefetching](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/274). At least you will now use prefetching with an understanding of the negative consequences and in an informed consent manner.

The `gnuzilla.org` filter list _""Block all well known privacy trackers""_ **has been removed**, due to it's high likelihood of breaking web pages. The filter list [I learned](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/77#issuecomment-97189326) is made from piecing together already existing filter lists, i.e. _EasyList_, _EasyPrivacy_, _Fanboy Social_, except that all exception filters to ensure no page breakage are removed.

Two alternatives for those who really want to use that list:
1. Non-recommended: Use http://gnuzilla.gnu.org/filters/blacklist.txt as custom filter list.
2. Recommended: if privacy is a top concern and you do not mind page breakage, use uBlock's [dynamic filtering in default-deny mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-default-deny).
   - This will be even much more strict than the `gnuzilla.org` filter list can ever be.
   - You gain the ability to very easily un-break web pages through simple point-and-click.

Cosmetic filters are now reported in the logger (related long-standing issue: https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/308).
- Whatever added overhead incurred as a result of surveying active cosmetic filters exists **if and only if** the logger is opened, and **only** for whatever tab is being logged.

Tool added to logger: ability to manually evaluate static filters (related long-standing issue: https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/10).
- Mostly useful to advanced users for when trying to diagnose filtering issues.
- Example: a user complained of [non-blocked popups](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/1294#issuecomment-96375391).
- I could not reproduce the issue, as the web site was not serving me the specific popup which was reportedly not blocked.
- However now I can enter manually the URL, and other relevant parameters.
- Result: within seconds I could [identify what was the issue](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/1294#issuecomment-96394641).
- No internationalization available yet (please do not file an issue).

Various other trivial improvements to the logger.
- Fixed regression bug: [Console error when you clear request log and try to reload](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/123)

The derivation of synthetic hostnames for special pages has been extended to enable more specific rules. For examples:
- Whitelist only Firefox Hello: `loopconversation.about-scheme` (derived from `about:loopconversation`).
- Whitelist only `about:blank`: `blank.about-scheme` (derived from `about:blank`).
- Whitelist uBlock's own pages (Firefox): `ublock0.chrome-scheme` (derived from `chrome://ublock0/[...]`).
- Whitelist uBlock's own pages (Chromium): `cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm.chrome-extension-scheme` (derived from `chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/[...]`).
- Whitelist all extensions' pages (Chromium): `chrome-extension-scheme` (derived from `chrome-extension://[...]`).
- Etc.
- All these synthetic hostnames can also be used in dynamic filtering rules.

#### Closed as fixed:

##### Chromium
- [Detect ublock by sending ajax](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/140)

##### Firefox
- [uBlock is blocking Firefox Hello](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/135)
  - Firefox Hello widget is embedded in a tab which URL is `about:loopconversation#[...]`, so this means you need to whitelist `about-scheme` in the _Whitelist_ pane.

- [Strange bug with specific website](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/134)
  - Definitely a bad bug which was still lingering in uBlock.
  - The bug surfaced only for when a user created custom filters using the element picker.
  - It was only a runtime bug, i.e. it disappeared when reloading the filter lists or rebooting uBlock.

Version 0.9.4.4 submitted to the Chrome store, and I see it has been labeled _""Pending Review""_. Not sure what's happening to the Chrome store lately, publishing new versions used to be straightforward. Probably some new mechanisms to automatically flag an extension when something of importance changes: logo, file added in package, etc. (just speculating).

Version 0.9.4.5 submitted to the Opera store, awaiting reviewer's approval (normal for Opera store).

- Icons/logo has been reworked a bit more, the last change was done in a hurry in order to restore the extension in the Chrome store. I am rather satisfied with this latest version, so it won't change anymore.
  - The reference icon is located [here (Inkscape svg)](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/doc/img/ublock.svg) if you need it.
- Cleanup of filter lists -- **please verify that your selected filter lists are still selected**:
  - GNU.org's _""Block all well known privacy trackers‎""_ added.
    - Usual warning applies: the more filters one use, the higher the likelihood of web page breakage (for example, this list currently breaks `amazon.ca` pages)  -- your call.
  - Obsolete filter lists have been removed (they were labelled _""obsolete, will be removed""_ since forever).
  - Some filter lists have been relocated to a new server -- issues [#14](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/14), [#75](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/75), [#844](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/844).
  - This will put to work code paths that have not been tested in the pass -- the seamless migration of existing filter lists to a new location, so please ensure that all the filter lists you had selected are still selected with this update.
  - Short term, this will also allow me to reduce the size of the extension package, as from now on I will avoid shipping optional filter lists as part of the extension package.

#### Important:

If you install uBlock₀ **manually**:

Because now this version is a fork of the previous repo, I needed to also change name for installation purpose, which means that with this release, uBlock₀ will no longer fetch settings from former uBlock, so it will install as if it was the first time.

Please backup all your settings using a prior release -- if not done yet. You can restore them all with this release. This can be easily done through the _Settings_ pane in uBlock₀'s dashboard: just click the _""Restore from file""_ button.

If you install from the Chrome/Opera store, there is nothing to do.

Related issue: [Make this version of uBlock to be installed alongside with gorhill's](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/1219).

#### New:
- New per-site switch to toggle cosmetic filtering on/off:
  - ![Toggle cosmetic filtering for a given site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/popup-1j.png)
  - Cosmetic filtering is of course enabled by default, so no change there.
  - The badge on the switch tells the number of DOM elements which have been hidden from view as a result of cosmetic filtering.
  - The switch is useful to create per-site exceptions as to when cosmetic filtering should not apply.
  - See [""Popup-user interface: no cosmetic filtering""](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface#no-cosmetic-filtering).
  - A good example page to try the switch (given the amount/size of ads on the page): https://www.google.com/search?q=buy+car.
  - An example of that new switch being useful to un-break a web page broken by cosmetic filtering: http://www.infoworld.com/article/2905688/applications/mozillas-rust-based-servo-browser-engine-inches-forward.html (as reported in https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/1192).
- Per-site switches can now be manually edited [manually](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Manually-editing-per-site-switches) from within the _""My rules""_ panes.
  - So for example, this now allows to do non-recommended things like to disable strict blocking everywhere (`no-strict-blocking: * true`).
- When a page is blocked because of strict blocking, the user is now given the choice to disable strict blocking for the whole domain.

#### Fixed:
- [uBlock automatically blocks mailing with 'list-manage.com/track'](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/1212)
  - This was one more occurrence where strict blocking appeared overzealous, so I relaxed a bit the heuristic, as per originally suggested in [issue #1128](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/1128) by @harshanvn.
  - This, coupled with the fact that it is now possible to disable strict blocking for a whole domain should make strict blocking less annoying.
- Support `font` network request type (related: https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/649).
- The display of tooltips in the popup UI.
- [Content scripts for cosmetic filtering active despite page being whitelisted](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues/144)
  - This was originally identified as a uMatrix issue but it turns out the problem was in uBlock.
- Refactoring of tab/root document URL binding code -- this takes care of many new and old issues at once. No formal issue, but [some are referred to in the code](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/commit/64411613294e44cd47cd2c1c7438e7f632d2e7f2#diff-ce215d94a52d449f1a34f292126608d7).
