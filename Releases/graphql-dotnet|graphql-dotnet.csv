By default it should convert them as it is currently, with camelCase field names using `CamelCaseFieldNameConverter`.  This can be changed by setting the `FieldNameConverter` property in the execution configuration.
- BREAKING CHANGES:
  - The `DocumentWriter` no longer uses `CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver`.
  - Because of the previous use of `CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver`, Aliases would get converted to camelCase.  Aliases now do not get converted and will be returned exactly as they are requested.
- Note: You can write your own `IFieldNameConverter` - keep in mind that some field names, such as those used by introspection, need to remain camelCase for tools like GraphiQL to work.

### Additions
- Documentation!  There is now some basic documentation [available here](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/tree/master/docs)
- The preferred way to configure the execution engine has changed.  Please use the configuration action or the `ExecutionParameters` overloads for `ExecuteAsync`.  The old `ExecuteAsync` with a ton of optional parameters will be deprecated in a future release.

``` csharp
var schema = new Schema { Query = new StarWarsQuery() };

var result = await new DocumentExecuter().ExecuteAsync( _ =>
{
  _.Schema = schema;
  _.Query = @""
      query {
        hero {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    "";
}).ConfigureAwait(false);

var json = new DocumentWriter(indent: true).Write(result);
```
- Add query complexity analysis
- The core engine now supports both Type based and Instance based registration
- Add Metadata dictionaries to fields and objects
- Add field middleware
- Basic Metrics are now being tracked and field level metrics can be enabled with the new `InstrumentFieldsMiddleware` field middleware

``` csharp
var result = await _executer.ExecuteAsync(_ =>
{
    _.FieldMiddleware.Use<InstrumentFieldsMiddleware>();
}).ConfigureAwait(false);
```
- Make `GraphTypesLookup` more thread safe
- Add `EnumerationGraphType<TEnum>`

### Fixes
- Fix bug when trying to register an interface type on `ObjectGraphType<T>`
- Fix issue where an already faulted task would attempt to be awaited

- `GetArgument()` wasn't using the `FieldDefinition`'s default value for an argument correctly. Added method signature for using the `FieldDefinition` default, and one for overriding the value
- `ConnectionType<T>`, `EdgeType<T>` and `PageInfoType` implementations have been separated from their backing data objects. Improved and more consistent Relay-specific helper functions for these will be transitioned over to graphql-dotnet/conventions
- Moved Relay-specific type structures to the `GraphQL.Types.Relay` namespace
- Removed `new()` constraint on connections and edges
- Exposing `ResolveFieldContext` in `FieldBuilder` and `ConnectionBuilder` (and consequently also the `CancellationToken`, etc.)
- Added new scalar type `DecimalGraphType`
- Added support for deprecation of `EnumerationGraphType` members
- Added a range of unit tests for the above
- Implemented `IdGraphType.Coerce()`
- `IntGraphType.Coerce()` can now also deal with `long` integers

- `GraphQLAbstractType` now has a `PossibleTypes` property which is a list of graph types of all possible types that abstract type could be.
- The `PossibleTypes` collection is populated on bootstrap of the Schema.

`IsTypeOf` allows you to replace usages of `ResolveType`.  It allows you to place the type check within the specific object graph type.  This makes it so each interface or union type does not need to have a specific check for each of their possible types.
