After this release much of devtools' functionality will be split into separate smaller packages, however the devtools package will still remain as a meta package.

## New Features

* `spell_check` gains a `dict` argument to set a custom language or dictionary

* `release()` now checks documentation for spelling errors by default.

* New `use_gpl3_license()` sets the license field in `DESCRIPTION` and
  includes a copy of the license in `LICENSE`.

## Revdep check improvements

* Various minor improvements around checking of reverse dependencies
  (#1284, @krlmlr). All packages involved are listed at the start,
  the whole process is now more resilient against package
  installation failures.

* `revdep_check()` and `revdep_check_resume()` gain a skip argument
  which takes a character vector of packages to skip.

* `revdep_check()` and `check_cran()` gain a `quiet_check` argument.
  You can use `quiet_check = FALSE` to see the actual text of R CMD
  check as it runs (not recommending with multiple threads).

* `revdep_check_resume()` now takes `...` which can be used to
  override settings from `revdep_check()`. For debugging a problem
  with package checks, try
  `revdep_check(threads = 1, quiet_check = FALSE)`

* `revdep_check()` collects timing information in `timing.md` (#1319, @krlmlr).

* Package names and examples are sorted in case-insensitive C collation (#1322, @krlmlr).

* `use_revdep()` adds `.gitignore` entry for check database (#1321, @krlmlr).

* Own package is installed in temporary library for revdep checking (#1338, @krlmlr).

* Automated revdep check e-mails now can use the new `my_version` and
  `you_cant_install` variables. The e-mail template has been updated
  to use these variables (#1285, @krlmlr).

* Installation failures are logged during revdep checking, by default in
  `revdep/install`. Once an installation has failed, it is not attempted
  a second time (#1300, @krlmlr).

* Print summary table in README.md and problems.md (#1284, @krlmlr).Revdep

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Handle case of un-installed package being passed to session_info (#1281).

* Using authentication to access Github package name. (#1262, @eriknil).

* `spell_check()` checks for hunspell before running (#1475, @jimvine).

* `add_desc_package()` checks for package dependencies correctly (#1463, @thomasp85).

* Remove deprecated `args` argument from `install_git()` to allow passthrough to `install` (#1373, @ReportMort).

* added a `quiet` argument to `install_bitbucket()`, with a default value
  of `FALSE` (fixes issue #1345, @plantarum).

* `update_packages()` allows for override of interactive prompt (#1260, @pkq).

* `use_test()` template no longer includes useless comments (#1349)

* Add encoding support in `test_dir()` call by adding reference to pkg$encoding (#1306, @hansharhoff)

* Parse valid Git remote URLs that lack trailing `.git`, e.g. GitHub browser URLs (#1253, @jennybc).

* Add a `check_bioconductor()` internal function to automatically install
  BiocInstaller() if it is not installed and the user wants to do so.

* Improve Git integration. `use_git_ignore()` and `use_git_config()` gain
  `quiet` argument, tests work without setting `user.name` and `user.email` Git
  configuration settings (#1320, @krlmlr).

* Improve Git status checks used in `release()` (#1205, @krlmlr).

* Improved handling of local `file://` repositories in `install()` (#1284, @krlmlr).

* `setup()` and `create()` gain new `quiet` argument (#1284, @krlmlr).

* Avoid unnecessary query of `available_packages()` (#1269, @krlmlr).

* Add cache setting to AppVeyor template (#1290, @krlmlr).

* Fix AppVeyor test by manually installing `curl` (#1301).

* `install(dependencies = FALSE)` doesn't query the available packages anymore (@krlmlr, #1269).

* `use_travis()` now opens a webpage in your browser to more easily activate
  a repo.

* `use_readme_rmd()` and `use_readme()` share a common template with sections
  for package overview, GitHub installation (if applicable), and an example
  (@jennybc, #1287).

* `test()` doesn't load helpers twice anymore (@krlmlr, #1256).

* Fix auto download method selection for `install_github()` on R 3.1 which
  lacks ""libcurl"" in `capabilities()`. (@kiwiroy, #1244)

- New `install_bioc()` function and bioc remote to install Bioconductor
  packages from their SVN repository.
- `install_dev_deps()` gets everything you need to start development on source
  package - it installs all dependencies, and roxygen2 (#1193).
- `use_dev_version()` automates the process of switching from a release
  version number by tweaking the `DESCRIPTION`, adding a heading to
  `NEWS.md` (if present), and checking into git (if you use it) (#1076.)
- `use_github()` accepts a host argument, similar to `install_github()` 
  (@ijlyttle, #1101)

## Bug fixes and minor improvements
- Update with Rtools-3.4 information, (@jimhester)

  on your system (#1059)
- Handle case when a GitHub request returns a non-JSON error response.
  (@jimhester, #1204, #1211)
- Suggested packages, including those specified as `Remotes:` are now installed
  after package installation. This allows you to use circular `Remotes:`
  dependencies for two related packages as long as one of the dependencies is a
  Suggested package. (@jimhester, #1184, hadley/dplyr#1809)
- bug fix for installation of binary packages on windows, they must be
  installed directly from a zip file. (@jimhester, #1191, #1192)
- `build_vignette()` will now only install the ""VignetteBuilder"" if it's 
  not present, not try and upgrade it if it is (#1139).
- `clean_dll()` Only removes package_name.def files and now operates
  recursively. (@jimhester, #1175, #1159, #1161)
- `check_man()` now prints a message if no problems are found (#1187).
- `install_*` functions and `update_packages()` refactored to allow updating of
  packages installed using any of the install methods. (@jimhester, #1067)
- `install_github()` now uses `https://api.github.com` as the host argument, so
  users can specify 'http:' or other protocols if needed. (@jimhester, #1131, #1200)
- `load_all()` runs package hooks before sourcing test helper files 
  allowing test helper to make use of objects created when a package is loaded 
  or attached. (@imanuelcostigan, #1146) 
- `revdep_check()` will now create the `revdep/` directory if it does not
  already exist (#1178).
- `source_gist()` gains a `filename` argument to specify a particular file to
  source from a GitHub gist. (@ateucher, #1172)
- Add a default codecov.yml file to turn off commenting with `use_coverage()`
  (@jimhester, #1188)

- `create_description()` now sets `Encoding: UTF-8`. This helps non-English
  package authors (#1123).
- All `use_` function have been overhauled to be more consistent, particularly
  arround notification. Most functions now also ask to overwrite if a file 
  already exists (#1074).
- `use_coverage()` now adds covr to ""Suggests"", rather than recommending you
  install it explicitly in `.travis.yml`.
- `use_cran_badge()` now uses HTTPS URL (@krlmlr, #1124).
- `use_github()` now confirms that you've picked a good title and description
  (#1092) and prints the url of the repo (#1063).
- `use_news()`, and `use_test()` open the files in RStudio (if you're using
  it and have the rstudioapi package installed).
- `use_testthat()` tells you what it's doing (#1056).  
- `use_travis()` generates a template compatible with the newest R-travis.
- `use_readme_md()` creates a basic `README.md` template (#1064).
- `use_revdep()` has an updated template for the new revdep check 
  system (#1090, @krlmlr). 
- Removed the deprecated `use_coveralls()`, `add_rstudio_project()`, 
  `add_test_infrastructure()`, and `add_travis()`.

## Checks and and release()
- `check()` now always succeeds (instead of throwing an error when 
  `R CMD check` finds an `ERROR`), returning an object that summarises
  the check failures.
- `check()` gains `run_dont_test` and `manual` arguments to control whether or 
  not `\donttest{}` tests are tested, or manuals are built. This defaults to 
  `FALSE`, but `release()` runs check with it set to `TRUE` (#1071; #1087, 
  @krlmlr).
- The `cleanup` argument to `check()` is deprecated: it now always returns
  the path to the check directory.
- `check_built()` allows you to run `R CMD check` on an already built package.
- `check_cran()` suppresses X11 with `DISPLAY = """"`.
- `release()` has been tweaked to improve the order of the questions, 
  and to ensure that you're ok with problems. It  warns if both `inst/NEWS.Rd` 
  and `NEWS.md` exist (@krlmlr, #1135), doesn't throw error if Git head is 
  detached (@krlmlr, #1136).
- `release()` gains an `args` argument to control build options, e.g.
  to allow passing `args = ""--compact-vignettes=both""` for packages with
  heavy PDF vignettes (@krlmlr, #1077).
- `system_check()` gains new arguments `path` to controls the working directory
  of the command, and `throw` to control whether or not it throws an error
  on command failure. `env` has been renamed to the more explicit `env_vars`.

## Revdep checks

`revdep_check()` has been overhauled. All `revdep_` functions now work like 
other devtools functions, taking a path to the package as the first argument.

`revdep_check()` now saves its results to disk as `check/check.rds`, and the other `revdep()` functions read from that cache. This also allows you to resume a partial run with `revdep_check_resume()`. This should be a big time saver if something goes unexpected wrong in the middle of the checks. You can blow away the cache and start afresh with `revdep_check_reset()`.

`revdep_check_save_summary()` now creates `README.md` to save one level of clicking in github. It also creates a `problems.md` that contains only results for only packages that had warnings or errors. Each problem is limited to at most 25 lines of output - this avoids lengthy output for failing examples. `revdep_check_print_problems()` prints a bulleted list of problems, suitable for inclusion in your `cran-comments.md`.

Summary results are reported as they come in, every then messages you'll get a message giving elapsed and estimated remaining time.

An experimental `revdep_email()` emails individual maintainers with their `R CMD check` summary results (#1014). See testthat and dplyr for example usage.

There were a handful of smaller fixes:
- `revdep_check()` doesn't complain about missing `git2r` package anymore
  (#1068, @krlmlr).
- Package index caches for `revdep_check()` now time out after 30 minutes.
- `revdep_check_save_logs()` has been removed - it is just not that useful.
- `revdep_check_summary()` has been removed - it never should have been
  part of the exported API.

## Other improvements
- Devtools now uses new gcc toolchain on windows, if installed (@jimhester).
- `install_git()` now allows you to pass credentials to git2r to specify
  specific ssh credentials (@onlymee, #982)
- `load_all()` now sources all test helpers if you use testthat. This makes it 
  much easier to interactively run tests (#1125). `load_all()` also correctly 
  handles `unix` and `windows` subdirectories within `R` (@gaborcsardi, #1102)
- `build_win()` defaults to only R-devel, since this is most commonly
  what you want.
- Help shims now inform you that you're using development documentation 
  (#1049).
- `git_sha1()` Fix fetching the latest git commit so that it also works
  for shallow git clones, i.e. git clones which make use of depth.

2486673,2016-01-22T15:17:41Z,2016-01-25T14:23:50Z,devtools 1.10.0,"## New features
- `curl`, `evaluate`, `roxygen2` and `rversions` have been moved from Imports
  to Suggests to lighten the dependency load of devtools. If you run a 
  function that needs one of the packages, you'll prompted to install it
  (#962, @jimhester).
- Devtools uses a new strategy for detecting RTools on windows: it now only 
  looks for Rtools if you need to `load_all()` or `build()` a package with
  compiled code. This should make it easier to work with devtools if
  you're developing pure R packages (#947).
- `package_file()` lets you find files inside a package. It starts by 
  finding the root directory of the package (i.e. the directory that contains 
  `DESCRIPTION`) (#985).
- `use_news_md()` adds a basic `NEWS.md` template (#957).
- `use_mit_license()` writes the necessary infrastructure to declare and 
  release an R package under the MIT license in a CRAN-compliant way. 
  (#995, @kevinushey)
- `check(cran = TRUE)` adds `--run-donttest` since you do need to test
  code in `\dontest()` for CRAN submission (#1002).

## Package installation
- `install()` installs packages specified in the `Additional_repositories`
  field, such as drat repositories. (#907, #1028, @jimhester). It 
  correctly installs missing dependencies (#1013, @gaborcsardi). If called on a
  Bioconductor package, include the Bioconductor repositories if they are not 
  already set (#895, @jimhester).
- `install()` gains a `metadata` argument which lets you add extra fields to
  the `DESCRIPTION` on install. (#1027, @rmflight)
- `install_github()` and `install_git()` only downloads and installs the
  package if the remote SHA1 reference differs from the currently installed 
  reference (#903, @jimhester).
- `install_local()` captures git and github information and stores it in the
  `DESCRIPTION` (#1027, @rmflight).
- `install_version()` is more robust when handling multiple repos (#943, #1030,
  @jimhester).
- Bugfix for `Remotes:` feature that prevented it from working if devtools was
  not attached as is done in travis-r (#936, @jimhester).

## Bug fixes and minor improvements
- `check_dev_versions()` checks only package dependencies (#983).
- `check_man()` replaces `check_doc()` (since most other functions are
  named after the corresponding directory). `check_doc()` will hang around
  as an alias for the forseeable future (#958).
- `create()` produces a dummy namespace will fake comment so roxygen2 will 
  overwrite silently (#1016).
- `create()` and `setup()` are more permissive -- they now accept a path to
  either a new directory or empty directory. (#966, @kevinushey)
- `document()` now only runs `update_collate()` once.
- `load_all()` resolves a longstanding lazy load database corruption issue when 
  reloading packages which define S3 methods on generics from base or other 
  packages (#1001, @jimhester).
- `release_checks()` gains two new checks:
  - `check_vignette_titles()` checks that your vignette titles aren't the 
    default ""Vignette Title"" (#960, @jennybc). 
  - `check_news_md()` checks that `NEWS.md` isn't in your `.Rbuildignore`
    (since it's now supported by CRAN, #1042).
- `revdep_check()`:
  - More verbose about which package is installed (#926, @krlmlr)
  - Verifies the integrity of already downloaded package archives 
    (#930, @krlmlr)
  - Is now more tolerant of errors when retrieving the summary for a
    checked package (#929, @krlmlr). 
  - When `ncpus > 1`, it includes the package name for when so you know 
    which package has failed and can start looking at the output without 
    needing to wait for all packages to finish (@mattdowle).
  - Uses proper repository when `BiocInstaller::useDevel(TRUE)` 
    (#937, @jimhester).
- Shimmed `system.file()` now respects `mustWork = TRUE` and throws an error
  if the file does not exist (#1034).
- `use_appveyor()` template now creates `failure.zip` artifact instead of
  polluting the logs with `R CMD check` output (#1017, @krlmlr, @HenrikBengtsson).
- `use_cran_comments()` template has been improved (#1038).
- `use_data()` now warns when trying to save the same object twice,
  and stops if there is no object to save (#948, @krlmlr).
- `use_revdep_check()` no longer includes `revdep_check_save_logs` in 
  default template. I found I never used the logs and they just cluttered up
  the package directory (#1003).
- `with_*()` functions have moved into the withr package, and devtools
  functions have been deprecated (#925, @jimhester).

- Remove explicit `library(testthat)` call in `test()` (#798, @krlmlr).
- `as.package()` and `load_all()` gain new argument `create`. Like other 
  functions with a `pkg` argument, `load_all()` looks for a `DESCRIPTION` file 
  in parent directories - if `create = TRUE` it will be automatically
  created if there's a `R/` or `data/` directory (#852, @krlmlr).
- `build_vignettes()` gains dependencies argument (#825, @krlmlr).
- `build_win()` now uses `curl` instead of `RCurl` for ftp upload.
- `check()` now uses a better strategy when `cran = TRUE`. Instead of 
  attempting to simulate `--as-cran` behaviour by turning on certain env vars,
  it now uses `--as-cran` and turns off problematic checks with env vars (#866).
  The problematic `cran_env_vars()` function has been removed.
- `find_rtools()` now looks for registry keys in both HKCU (user) and 
  HKLM (admin) locations (@Kevin-Jin, #844)
- `install()` can now install dependencies from remote repositories by
  specifying them as `Remotes` in the `DESCRIPTION` file (#902, @jimhester).
  See `vignette(""dependencies"")` for more details.
- `install_*()` detects if called on a Bioconductor package and if so,
  automatically includes the Bioconductor repositories if needed (#895,
  @jimhester).
- `install_deps()` now automatically upgrades out of date dependencies. This
  is typically what you want when you're working on a development version of a 
  package. To suppress this behaviour, set `upgrade_dependencies = FALSE` 
  (#863). `install_deps()` is more careful with `...` - this means additional
  arguments to `install_*` are more likely to work (#870).
- `install_gitorious()` has been removed since gitorious no longer exists
  (#913).
- `load_all()` no longer fails if a `useDynLib()` entry in the NAMESPACE 
  is incorrect. This should make it easy to recover from an incorrect
  `@useDynLib`, because re-documenting() should now succeed.
- `release()` works for packages not located at root of git repository 
  (#845, #846, @mbjones).
- `revdep_check()` now installs _suggested_ packages by default (#808), and 
  sets `NOT_CRAN` env var to `false` (#809). This makes testing more similar to
  CRAN so that more packages should pass cleanly. It also sets `RGL_USE_NULL`
  to `true` to stop rgl windows from popping up during testing (#897). It
  also downloads all source packages at the beginning - this makes life a 
  bit easier if you're on a flaky internet connection (#906).
- New `uninstall()` removes installed package (#820, @krlmlr).
- Add `use_coverage()` function to add codecov.io or coveralls.io to a project,
  deprecate `use_coveralls()` (@jimhester, #822, #818).
- `use_cran_badge()` uses canonical url form preferred by CRAN.
- `use_data()` also works with data from the parent frame (#829, @krlmlr).
- `use_git_hook()` now creates `.git/hooks` if needed (#888)
- GitHub integration extended: `use_github()` gains a `protocol` argument (ssh or https), populates URL and BugReports fields of DESCRIPTION (only if non-existent or empty), pushes to the newly created GitHub repo, and sets a remote tracking branch. `use_github_links()` is a new exported function. `dr_github()` diagnoses more possible problems. (#642, @jennybc).
- `use_travis()`: Default travis script leaves notifications on default 
  settings.
- `uses_testthat()` and `check_failures()` are now exported (#824, #839, 
  @krlmlr).
- `use_readme_rmd()` uses `uses_git()` correctly  (#793).
- `with_debug()` now uses `with_makevars()` rather than `with_env()`, because R
  reads compilation variables from the Makevars rather than the environment
  (@jimhester, #788).
- Properly reset library path after `with_lib()` (#836, @krlmlr).
- `remove_s4classes()` performs a topological sort of the classes

1281868,2015-05-08T19:54:14Z,2015-05-11T11:49:30Z,devtools 1.8.0,"## Helpers
- New `dr_devtools()` runs some common diagnostics: are you using the 
  latest version of R  and devtools? It is run automatically by 
  `release()` (#592).
- `use_code_of_conduct()` adds a contributor code of conduct from 
  http://contributor-covenant.org. (#729)
- `use_coveralls()` allows you to easily add test coverage with coveralls
  (@jimhester, #680, #681).
- `use_git()` sets up a package to use git, initialising the repo and
  checking the existing files.
- `use_test()` adds a new test file (#769, @krlmlr).
- New `use_cran_badge()` adds a CRAN status badge that you can copy into a README file. Green indicates package is on CRAN. Packages not yet submitted or accepted to CRAN get a red badge.

## Package installation and info
- `build_vignettes()` automatically installs the VignetteBuilder package,
  if necessary (#736).
- `install()` and `install_deps()` gain a `...` argument, so additional
  arguments can be passed to `utils::install.packages()` (@jimhester, #712).
  `install_svn()` optionally accepts a revision (@lev-kuznetsov, #739).
  `install_version()` now knows how to look in multiple repos (#721).
- `package_deps()` (and `dev_package_deps()`) determines all recursive 
  dependencies and whether or not they're up-to-date (#663). Use
  `update(package_deps(""xyz""))` to update out of date dependencies. This code 
  is used in `install_deps()` and `revdep_check()` - it's slightly more 
  aggressive than previous code (i.e. it forces you to use the latest version), 
  which should avoid problems when you go to submit to CRAN.
- New `update_packages()` will install a package (and its dependencies) only if
  they are missing or out of date (#675).
- `session_info()` can now take a vector of package names, in which case it
  will print the version of those packages and their dependencies (#664).

## Git and github
- Devtools now uses the git2r package to inspect git properties and install
  remote git packages with `install_git()`. This should be considerably
  more reliable than the previous strategy which involves calling the 
  command line `git` client. It has two small downsides: `install_git()`
  no longer accepts additional `args`, and must do a deep clone when
  installing.
- `dr_github()` checks for common problems with git/github setup (#643).
- If you use git, `release()` now warns you if you have uncommited changes,
  or if you've forgotten to synchronise with the remote (#691).
- `install_github()` warns if repository contains submodules (@ashander, #751).

## Bug fixes and minor improvements
- Previously, devtools ran all external R processes with `R --vanilla`.
  Now it only suppresses user profiles, and constructs a custom `.Rprofile` to
  override the default.  Currently, this `.Rprofile` sets up the `repos` option.
  Among others, this enables the cyclic dependency check in `devtools::release`
  (#602, @krlmlr).
- `R_BROWSER` and `R_PDFVIEWER` environment variables are set to ""false"" to 
  suppress random windows opening during checks.
- Devtools correctly identifies RTools 3.1 and 3.2 (#738), and
  preserves continuation lines in the `DESCRIPTION` (#709).
- `dev_help()` now uses `normalizePath()`. Hopefully this will make it more
  likely to work if you're on windows and have a space in the path.
- `lint()` gains a `cache` argument (@jimhester, #708).
- Fixed namespace issues related to `stats::setNames()` (#734, #772) and 
  `utils::unzip()` (#761, @robertzk).
- `release()` now reminds you to check the existing CRAN check results page
  (#613) ands shows file size before uploading to CRAN (#683, @krlmlr).
- `RCMD()` and `system_check()` are now exported so they can be used by other 
  packages. (@jimhester, #699).
- `revdep_check()` creates directories if needed (#759).
- `system_check()` combines arguments with ` `, not`, `. (#753)
- `test()` gains an `...` argument so that additional arguments can be passed
  to `testthat::test_dir` (@jimhester, #747)
- `use_travis()` now suggests you link to the svg icon since that looks a 
  little sharper. Default template sets `CRAN: http://cran.rstudio.com/` to 
  enable the cyclic dependency check.
- `NOT_CRAN` envvar no longer overrides externally set variable.
- `check(check_version = TRUE)` also checks spelling of the `DESCRIPTION`; if no
  spell checker is installed, a warning is given (#784, @krlmlr).

860538,2015-01-16T12:38:38Z,2015-01-17T13:22:07Z,Devtools 1.7.0,"## Improve reverse dependency checking

Devtools now supports a new and improved style of revdep checking with `use_revdep()`. This creates a new directory called `revdep` which contains a `check.R` template. Run this template to check all reverse dependencies, and save summarised results to `check/summary.md`. You can then check this file into git, making it much easier to track how reverse dependency results change between versions. The documentation for `revdep_check()` is much improved, and should be more useful (#635)

I recommend that you specify a library to use when checking with `options(""devtools.revdep.libpath"")`. (This should be a directory that already exists). This should be difference from your default library to keep the revdep environment isolated from your development environment.

I've also tweaked the output of `revdep_maintainers()` so it's easier to copy and paste into an email (#634). This makes life a little easier pre-release.

## New helpers
- `lint()` runs `lintr::lint_package()` to check style consistency and errors
  in a package. (@jimhester, #694)
- `use_appveyor()` sets up a package for testing with AppVeyor (@krlmlr, #549).
- `use_cran_comments()` creates a `cran-comments.md` template and adds it
  to `.Rbuildignore` to help with CRAN submissions. (#661)
- `use_git_hook()` allows you to easily add a git hook to a package.
- `use_readme_rmd()` sets up a template to generate a `README.md` from a
  `README.Rmd` with knitr.

## Minor improvements
- Deprecated `doc_clean` argument to `check()` has been removed.
- Initial package version in `create()` is now `0.0.0.9000` (#632).
  `create()` and `create_description()` checks that the package name is 
  valid  (#610).
- `load_all()` runs `roxygen2::update_collate()` before loading code. This
  ensures that files are sourced in the way you expect, as defined by 
  roxygen `@include` tags. If you don't have any `@include` tags, the
  collate will be not be touched (#623).
- `session_info()` gains `include_base` argument to also display loaded/attached
  base packages (#646).
- `release()` no longer asks if you've read the CRAN policies since the 
  CRAN submission process now asks the same question (#692). 
  
    `release(check = TRUE)` now runs some additional custom checks. These include:
  - Checking that you don't depend on a development version of a package.
  - Checking that the version number has exactly three components (#633).
    
    `release()` now builds packages without the `--no-manual` switch, both for
    checking and for actually building the release package (#603, @krlmlr). 
    `build()` gains an additional argument `manual`, defaulting to `FALSE`, 
    and `check()` gains `...` unmodified to `build()`.
- `use_travis()` now sets an environment variable so that any WARNING will
  also cause the build to fail (#570).
- `with_debug()` and `compiler_flags()` set `CFLAGS` etc instead of 
  `PKG_CFLAGS`. `PKG_*` are for packages to use, the raw values are for users
  to set. (According to http://cran.rstudio.com/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Using-Makevars)
- New `setup()` works like `create()` but assumes an existing, not necessarily 
  empty, directory (#627, @krlmlr).

## Bug fixes
- When installing a pull request, `install_github()` now uses the repository
  associated with the pull request's branch (and not the repository of the user
  who created the pull request) (#658, @krlmlr).
- `missing_s3()` works once again (#672)
- Fixed scoping issues with `unzip()`.

## Tool templates and `create()`
- `create()` no longer generates `man/` directory - roxygen2 now does
  this automatically. It also no longer generates an package-level doc
  template. If you want this, use `use_package_doc()`. It also makes a dummy 
  namespace so that you can build & reload without running `document()` first.
- New `use_data()` makes it easy to include data in a package, either 
  in `data/` (for exported datasets) or in `R/sysdata.rda` (for internal
  data). (#542)
- New `use_data_raw()` creates `data-raw/` directory for reproducible
  generation of `data/` files (#541).
- New `use_package()` allows you to set dependencies (#559). 
- New `use_package_doc()` sets up an Roxygen template for package-level
  docs.
- New `use_rcpp()` sets up a package to use Rcpp.
- `use_travis()` now figures out your github username and repo so it can 
  construct the markdown for the build image. (#546)
- New `use_vignette()` creates a draft vignette using Rmarkdown (#572).
- renamed `add_rstudio_project()` to `use_rstudio()`, `add_travis()` to 
  `use_travis()`, `add_build_ignore()` to `use_build_ignore()`, and 
  `add_test_infrastructure()` to `use_testthat()` (old functions are 
  aliased to new)

## The release process
- You can add arbitrary extra questions to `release()` by defining a function 
  `release_questions()` in your package. Your `release_questions()` should 
  return a character vector of questions to ask (#451). 
- `release()` uses new CRAN submission process, as implemented by 
  `submit_cran()` (#430).

## Package installation
- All `install_*` now use the same code and store much useful metadata.
  Currently only `session_info()` takes advantage of this information,
  but it will allow the development of future tools like generic update
  functions.
- Vignettes are no longer installed by default because they potentally require 
  all suggested packages to also be installed. Use `build_vignettes = TRUE` to 
  force building and to install all suggested packages (#573).
- `install_bitbucket()` has been bought into alignment with `install_github()`:
  this means you can now specify repos with the compact `username/repo@ref`
  syntax. The `username` is now deprecated. 
- `install_git()` has been simplified and many of the arguments have changed 
  names for consistency with metadata for other package installs.
- `install_github()` has been considerably improved:
  - `username` is deprecated - please include the user in the repo name: 
    `rstudio/shiny`, `hadley/devtools` etc. 
  - `dependencies = TRUE` is no longer forced (regression in 1.5) 
    (@krlmlr, #462).
  - Deprecated parameters `auth_user`, `branch`, `pull` and `password` have 
    all been removed.
  - New `host` argument which allows you to install packages from github 
    enterprise (#410, #506). 
  - The GitHub API is used to download archive file (@krlmlr, #466) - this
    makes it less likely to break in the future.
  - To download a specified pull request, use `ref = github_pull(...)`
    (@krlmlr, #509). To install the latest release, use `""user/repo@*release""` 
    or `ref = github_release()` (@krlmlr, #350).
- `install_gitorious()` has been bought into alignment with `install_github()`:
  this means you can now specify repos with the compact `username/repo@ref`
  syntax. You must now always supply user (project) name and repo.
- `install_svn()` lets you install an R package from a subversion repository
  (assuming you have subversion installed).
- `decompress()` and hence `install_url()` now work when the downloaded
  file decompresses without additional top-level directory (#537).

## Other minor improvements and bug fixes
- If you're using Rstudio, and you you're trying to build a binary package
  without the necessary build tools, Rstudio will prompt to download and
  install the right thing. (#488)
- Commands are no longer run with `LC_ALL=C` - this no longer seems 
  necessary (#507).
- `build(binary = TRUE)` creates an even-more-temporary package library
  avoid conflicts (#557).
- `check_dir()` no longer fails on UNC paths (#522).
- `check_devtools()` also checks for dependencies on development versions
  of packages (#534).
- `load_all()` no longer fails on partial loading of a package containing
  S4 or RC classes (#577).
- On windows, `find_rtools()` is now run on package load, not package
  attach.
- `help()`, `?`, and `system.file()` are now made available when a package is
  loaded with `load_all()`, even if the devtools package isn't attached.
- `httr` 0.3 required (@krlmlr, #466).
- `load_all()` no longer gives an error when objects listed as exports are
  missing.
- Shim added for `library.dynam.unload()`.
- `loaded_packages()` now returns package name and path it was loaded from. 
  (#486)
- The `parenvs()` function has been removed from devtools, because is now in the
  pryr package.
- `missing_s3()` uses a better heuristic for determining if a function
  is a S3 method (#393).
- New `session_info()` provides useful information about your R session.
  It's a little more focussed than `sessionInfo()` and includes where
  packages where installed from (#526).
- `rstudioapi` package moved from suggests to imports, since it's always 
  needed (it's job is to figure out if rstudio is available, #458)
- Implemented own version `utils::unzip()` that throws error if command
  fails and doesn't print unneeded messages on non-Windows platforms (#540).
- Wrote own version of `write.dcf()` that doesn't butcher whitespace and 
  fieldnames.

## Removed functionality
- The `fresh` argument to `test()` has been removed - this is best done by 
  the editor since it can run the tests in a completely clean environment
  by starting a new R session.

Four new functions make it easier to add useful infrastructure to packages:
- `add_test_infrastructure()` will create test infrastructure for a new package.
  It is called automatically from `test()` if no test directories are
  found, the session is interactive and you agree.
- `add_rstudio_project()` adds an Rstudio project file to your package.
  `create()` gains an `rstudio` argument which will automatically create
  an Rstudio project in the package directory. It defaults to `TRUE`:
  if you don't use Rstudio, just delete the file.
- `add_travis()` adds a basic travis template to your package. `.travis.yml`
  is automatically added to `.Rbuildignore` to avoid including it in the built
  package.
- `add_build_ignore()` makes it easy to add files to `.Rbuildignore`,
  correctly escaping special characters

Two dependencies were incremented:
- devtools requires at least R version 3.0.2.
- `document()` requires at least roxygen2 version 3.0.0.

## Minor improvements
- `build_win()` now builds R-release and R-devel by default (@krlmlr, #438).
  It also gains parameter `args`, which is passed on to `build()`
  (@krlmlr, #421).
- `check_doc()` now runs `document()` automatically.
- `install()` gains `thread` argument which allows you to install multiple
  packages in parallel (@mllg, #401). `threads` argument to `check_cran()`
  now defaults to `getOption(""Ncpus"")`
- `install_deps(deps = T)` no longer installs all dependencies of
  dependencies (#369).
- `install_github()` now prefers personal access tokens supplied to
  `auth_token` rather than passwords (#418, @jeroenooms).
- `install_github()` now defaults to `dependencies = TRUE` so you definitely
  get all the packages you need to build from source.
- devtools supplies its own version of `system.file()` so that when the function
  is called from the R console, it will have special behavior for packages
  loaded with devtools.
- devtools supplies its own version of `help` and `?`, which will search
  devtools-loaded packages as well as normally-loaded packages.

## Bug fixes
- `check_devtools()` no longer called by `check()` because the relevant
  functionality is now included in `R CMD CHECK` and it was causing
  false positives (#446).
- `install_deps(TRUE)` now includes packages listed in `VignetteBuilder` (#396)
- `build()` no longer checks for `pdflatex` when building vignettes, as
  many modern vignettes don't need it (#398). It also uses
  `--no-build-vignettes` for >3.0.0 compatibility (#391).
- `release()` does a better job of opening your email client if you're inside
  of Rstudio (#433).
- `check()` now correctly reports the location of the `R CMD check` 
  output when called with a custom `check_dir`. (Thanks to @brentonk)
- `check_cran()` records check times for each package tested.
- Improved default `DESCRIPTION` file created by `create_description()`.
  (Thanks to @ncarchedi, #428)
- Fixed bug in `install_github()` that prevented installing a pull request by
  supplying `repo = ""username/repo#pull""`. (#388)
- explicitly specify user agent when querying user name and ref for pull request
  in `install_github`. (Thanks to Kirill Müller, #405)
- `install_github()` now removes blank lines found in a package `DESCRIPTION`
  file, protecting users from the vague `error: contains a blank line` error.

- `install()` now respects the global option `keep.source.pkgs`.
- `install()` gains a `build_vignettes` which defaults to TRUE, and ensures 
  that vignettes are built even when doing a local install. It does this
  by forcing `local = FALSE` if the package has vignettes, so `R CMD build`
  can follow the usual process. (#344) 
- `install_github()` now takes repo names of the form `username/repo` - 
  this is now the recommended form for install_github if your username is
  not hadley ;)
- `install_github()` now adds details on the source of the installed package 
  (e.g. repository, SHA1, etc.) to the package DESCRIPTION file. (Thanks to JJ 
  Allaire)
- Adjusted `install_version()` to new meta data structure on CRAN. 
  (Thanks to Kornelius Rohmeyer)
- Fixed bug so that `install_version()` works with version numbers that 
  contain hyphens. (Thanks to Kornelius Rohmeyer)
- `install_deps()` is now exported, making it easier to install the dependencies
  of a package.

## Other minor improvements
- `build(binary = TRUE)` now no longer installs the package as a side-effect.

- `build_github_devtools()` is a new function which makes it easy for Windows
  users to upgrade to the development version of devtools.
- `create_description()` does a better job of combining defaults and user
  specified options. (#332)
- `install()` also installs the dependencies that do not have the required
  versions; besides, the argument `dependencies` now works like
  `install.packages()` (in previous versions, it was essentially
  `c(""Depends"", ""Imports"", ""LinkingTo"")`) (thanks, Yihui Xie, #355)
- `check()` and `check_cran()` gain new `check_dir` argument to control where 
  checking takes place (#337)
- `check_devtools()` no longer incorrectly complains about a `vignettes/`
  directory
- Decompression of zip files now respects `getOption(""unzip"")` (#326)
- `dev_help` will now use the Rstudio help pane, if you're using a recent
  version of Rstudio (#322)
- Release is now a little bit smarter: if it's a new package, it'll ask you
  to read and agree to the CRAN policies; it will only ask about
  dependencies if it has any.
- `source_url()` (and `source_gist()`) accept SHA1 prefixes.
- `source_gist()` uses the github api to reliably locate the raw gist.
  Additionally it now only attempts to source files with `.R` or `.r` 
  extensions, and gains a `quiet` argument. (#348)
- Safer installation of source packages, which were previously extracted
  directly into the temp directory; this could be a problem if directory
  names collide. Instead, source packages are now extracted into unique
  subdirectories.
