GitHub is assigning numbers to pull requests and issues and the ""10000"" is a [PR](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/10000). Our ratio is around 1/3 issues and 2/3 pull requests. To be more precise: 64% pull requests and 36% issues.

If you haven't noticed, there is now a [glossary](https://home-assistant.io/docs/glossary/) that collects some Home Assistant relevant terms. Talking about the documentation: [@DubhAd](https://github.com/DubhAd) rewrote large parts of the [Z-Wave section](https://home-assistant.io/docs/z-wave/). More structure to get started and to find details during the setup and the configuration.

## Google Assistant / Google Home integration
This release includes a new component to integrate Home Assistant with Google Assistant by [Phil Kates][@philk]. We integrate via the Smart Home API, which means that you will be able to control your devices in Home Assistant via any device that has Google Assistant. Learn more in [the documentation][googleactions docs].

## Hacktoberfest
[Hacktoberfest](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/09/29/hacktoberfest/) is still going on and so far we have received many improvements. We can't make any promises to review everything by the end of October, but we are trying to make sure that you will get your t-shirt.

## Map
The [map][map docs] is now its own component. Similar to [configuration (`config:`)](https://home-assistant.io/components/config/), it will not show up without adding it to your `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
map:
```

## Travis CI
Why not observe your [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) jobs with Home Assistant? [@tchellomello] created a [Travis CI][sensor.travisci docs] sensor which allows one to check on the current state of Travis jobs. Now you can make sure that the [coffee](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/28/face-coffee-wink/#first-coffee-maker-supported) is ready when the build passed.

8035776,2017-10-07T19:50:52Z,2017-10-07T19:51:21Z,0.55,"Beside the improved Wink support which was contributed by [@w1ll1am23], ships this release a wide variety of new components and platforms. The `input_slider` components has received a makeover by [@BioSehnsucht] and is now [`input_number`][input_number docs]. [@tinloaf] added a feature that allows you to enter dates: [`input_datetime`][input_datetime docs]. Both will help you to improve your automation rules.

## DuckDNS

Using Home Assistant with [DuckDNS](http://www.duckdns.org) for Dynamic DNS (DDNS or DynDNS) is an [old story](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2015/12/13/setup-encryption-using-lets-encrypt/). DuckDNS  is also integrated in [Hass.io](https://home-assistant.io/addons/duckdns/). 0.55 ships a component for no Hass.io users to get a similar feature.

## Recorder

The purging of data was [improved][recorder docs]. With `purge_interval` you can schedule regular purges of older events and states. In combination you can specify with `purge_keep_days` the amount of days you want to keep. The new service `recorder.purge` allow to handle this task when needed.

## Owntracks

[Owntracks](http://owntracks.org/) is an easy way to track your devices. For some times we have the device tracker which depends on [MQTT][device_tracker.owntracks docs] but thanks to a new feature in Owntracks we can now offer support for HTTP. The [new platform][device_tracker.owntracks_http docs] doesn't require a MQTT broker but sends messages directly as HTTP requests to Home Assistant.

## Tibber

This release introduces a new sensor: [Tibber][sensor.tibber docs]. The sensor provides the current electricity price if you are a [Tibber](https://tibber.com/) customer. This will allow you to make automation for turning off the heater when the electricity price is high or only charge your electric car when the prices are low. We further plan to add support for showing future electricity prices and historic electricity consumption data. Tibber is currently only available in Norway and Sweden

## The Things Network

[The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) (TTN) is a [LoRaWAN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/LoRaWAN/Home) based network especially designed for IoT devices. With this [integration][thethingsnetwork docs] one can observe the state of devices which are out of range of the local WiFi network as long as they are connected to a TTN gateway.

7693502,2017-09-09T07:51:52Z,2017-09-09T07:54:05Z,0.53,"The Home Assistant community has been super busy in the last two weeks to bring you this amazing release. 60 different contributors have done over a 100 PRs filled with new features, bug fixes and performance improvements.

9 days away from our 4th birthday, we've just accomplished a couple of great milestones that I would love to share with you. We've hit over 8000 stars 🌟  on GitHub and starting this release we now ship over 800 platforms and components!

## Customize editor

Another step in making Home Assistant configurable via the frontend has been contributed by @andrey-git: a customization editor! You are now able to inspect all (possible) customizations of an entity and update them with just a few taps. Want to change the name or icon of an entity? All possible in mere seconds.

![screen shot 2017-09-08 at 23 24 22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1444314/30237818-f5d0f95a-94ee-11e7-9da3-0818db50d33f.png)

New Home Assistant configurations will be created correctly automatically. If you are an existing user, make sure you have the config screen enabled and that you include customizations from `customize.yaml`. 

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
homeassistant:
  # Include the customizations.
  customize: !include customize.yaml

# Enable the config screen
config:
```

## Tesla

Thanks to the contribution by @zabuldon, you will now be able to control your Tesla car from Home Assistant. You're able to check the temperature inside and outside your car, control your AC and unlock the car.

## Input text

This release introduces a new input component: `input_text` contributed by @BioSehnsucht. With this component you will be able to set free form from the UI and then let that be used by your automations or templates. 

## KNX

This release ships a new KNX implementation thanks to @Julius2342. It will instantly show all changed states of KNX devices within Home Assistant. Additionally it brings support for HVAC devices and notification services. It also adds a service for direct communication with the KNX bus. You can connect to KNX/IP routing and tunnelling devices. In the background it uses asyncio communication.

## Breaking Changes

- The new customize editor is using the file `customize.yaml` in your config folder. If you are using this file today for other config, make sure to rename it before using the new customize UI editor. ([@andrey-git] - [#9134]) ([config docs]) ([config.customize docs]) (breaking change) (new-platform)
- The frontend component now supports loading custom html files when Home Assistant front end starts  ([@andrey-git] - [#9150]) (breaking change). It could be Javascript, CSS or custom Web Components. Along there was a breaking change in the way Custom UI is used:
  * `custom_ui_state_card` now specifies the exact element name and not a suffix after `state-card`. So if you had `state_card_custom_ui: custom-ui` in your config, you should change it to `state_card_custom_ui: state-card-custom-ui`
  * `custom_ui_state_card` no longer makes the html fetch, you should make it separately:

```
frontend:
  extra_html_url:
    - /local/custom_ui/state-card-custom-ui.html
```

- The Egardia alarm control panel now defaults to port 52010 instead of 85. ([@jeroenterheerdt] - [#9225]) ([alarm_control_panel.egardia docs]) (breaking change)
- The Homematic `delay` option has been dropped because it is no longer necessary ([@pvizeli] - [#9058]) ([homematic docs]) ([binary_sensor.homematic docs]) ([climate.homematic docs]) ([cover.homematic docs]) ([light.homematic docs]) ([sensor.homematic docs]) ([switch.homematic docs]) (breaking change)
- Switch - Dlink: Remove spaces and capital letters from attribute names for consistency ([@emlt] - [#9277]) ([switch.dlink docs]) (breaking change)

7530712,2017-08-26T05:11:12Z,2017-08-26T05:17:04Z,0.52,"Although the summer is in full progress, the development hasn't stalled. This release brings bug fixes, clean ups and another 8 new integrations. On top of that we are also introducing a new script editor!

To use the scripts editor, create a new file in your config directory named `scripts.yaml` and copy your existing scripts over:

```yaml
# scripts.yaml
turn_on_some_lights:
  alias: Turn on the lights
  sequence:
  - data: {}
    service: light.turn_on
```

 Than update your `configuration.yaml` to look like this:

```yaml
# Configuration.yaml example
script: !include scripts.yaml
```

Watch the scripts editor in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rntpcj1CGA

## New Platforms

- Nello.io lock support ([@pschmitt] - [#8957]) ([lock.nello docs]) (new-platform)
- Add HipChat notify service. ([@BioSehnsucht] - [#8918]) ([notify.hipchat docs]) (new-platform)
- Refactor USPS into component with Sensors+Camera ([@mezz64] - [#8679]) ([usps docs]) ([camera.usps docs]) ([sensor.usps docs]) (breaking change) (new-platform)
- Adds London_air component ([@robmarkcole] - [#9020]) ([sensor.london_air docs]) (new-platform)
- Add Abode home security component ([@arsaboo] - [#9030]) ([abode docs]) ([alarm_control_panel.abode docs]) ([binary_sensor.abode docs]) (new-platform)

- Add worldtidesinfo sensor component ([@aetolus] - [#8860]) ([sensor.worldtidesinfo docs]) (new-platform)

## Breaking Changes

- Remove spaces from Xiami switch attributes ([@syssi] - [#8952]) ([switch.xiaomi docs]) (breaking change)
- MQTT Switch: command and availability payload are now no longer linked. Command and availability payload default to ON/OFF and must be configured individually if custom values are required. ([@timstanley1985] - [#8934]) ([switch.mqtt docs]) (breaking change)

```yaml
 -  platform: mqtt
    name: ""Kitchen""
    state_topic: ""stat/sonoff_1/POWER""
    command_topic: ""cmnd/sonoff_1/POWER""
    availability_topic: ""tele/sonoff_1/LWT""
    payload_available: ""Online""
    payload_not_available: ""Offline""
    retain: true
```

- Refactor USPS into component with Sensors+Camera ([@mezz64] - [#8679]) ([usps docs]) ([camera.usps docs]) ([sensor.usps docs]) (breaking change) (new-platform)

```yaml
usps:
  username: user
  password: pass
  name: optional
```

- eliqonline: The optional channel_id configuration variable of the Eliqonline sensor needs to be a positive integer. ([@molobrakos] - [#9072]) ([sensor.eliqonline docs]) (breaking change)
- MySensors: Not a breaking change per se but users that have not been following the mysensors [serial API](https://www.mysensors.org/download/serial_api_20) could face dropped messages after this change. Messages are now validated according to the API before being passed along from/to devices. See [0.11 release notes](https://github.com/theolind/pymysensors/releases/tag/0.11) for more info. ([@MartinHjelmare] - [#9069]) ([mysensors docs]) ([binary_sensor.mysensors docs]) ([climate.mysensors docs]) ([cover.mysensors docs]) ([device_tracker.mysensors docs]) ([light.mysensors docs]) ([notify.mysensors docs]) ([sensor.mysensors docs]) ([switch.mysensors docs]) (breaking change)
- Automatic has disabled password authentication on their API. Home Assistant will now use OAuth2 to authenticate accounts. The following steps must be taken to transition your setup:
  1) Log in to your Automatic developer account. In the Automatic Developer Apps Manager, specify the OAuth Redirect URL in the developer page. This should be configured to `<home-assistant-url>/api/automatic/callback`. (Example: `http://hassio.local:8123/api/automatic/callback`) Note that this URL only needs to be accessible from the browser you use to perform the authentication.
  2) Remove username/password from your automatic device tracker configuration in configuration.yaml.
  3) If you have authorized your account for `scope:current_location`, add `current_location: true` to your automatic device tracker configuration in configuration.yaml.
  4) When you restart home assistant, click on the Automatic Configure link in the Configurator card, and follow the instructions to authorize Home Assistant.<br><br>NOTE: Automatic's API is currently not correctly authorizing with refresh tokens, so Step 4 currently needs to be performed after every restart. ([@armills] - [#8962] [#9002]) ([configurator docs]) ([device_tracker.automatic docs]) (breaking change)

7371108,2017-08-12T18:31:30Z,2017-08-12T18:36:30Z,0.51,"# This release contains a migration which can take a long time (20 minutes). During this time the frontend will not work. Do not stop Home Assistant while it is in progress.

Release 0.51 is around the corner and it contains some really great updates.

## Database speed up

The first one is the database updates [#8748] by [@OverloadUT]. Every query that has been tested executes in well under 1 second, even on a RPi using MySQL with 6 million rows and around 300 entities. This is true even when you're getting an unrealistically huge date range!

Updating the database will take some time when you start Home Assistant. During that time, Home Assistant is not usable. Please let it complete and do not turn Home Assistant off.

## Frontend update

We have finished the migration of our frontend to be powered by Polymer 2. This has given us a big speed boost on Safari/iOS devices and has fixed a wide range of bugs.

We have also finished the automation editor. All triggers and actions are now implemented and so are most conditions (missing are `and`, `or`). The automation editor is also no longer Chrome only, it can now also be used in Safari.

Another change to the frontend is that we have reorganized the panels. The Z-Wave and automation configuration panels have been merged into the configuration panel.

## Vacuum cleaners

As we have seen more vacuum cleaners land in Home Assistant, it was time to create an official component for them. That's why [@azogue] introduced the new vacuum cleaner component in  [#8623]. This allows first class integration of vacuum cleaners in Home Assistant. Out of the box we will have Dyson, Xiamo and Roomba as supported platforms.

7217685,2017-07-29T20:28:22Z,2017-07-29T20:29:54Z,0.50,"Last Wednesday we released [Hass.io](https://home-assistant.io/hassio/), an operating system to take care of all the updating hassles that come with running home automation at home and so much more. This is a major milestone for Home Assistant as it is our first step to offering a fully integrated solution using a bring your own hardware approach.

The launch has been crazy successful. The [20 minute introduction video][hassio-intro] by BRUHAutomation already has 12.5k views in just 4 days with no less than 150 comments.

Hass.io will be a great foundation for bigger and better integrated features. Stay tuned.

### Adding the power of voice to integrations

This release has completely revamped the way how we deal with voice integrations. We turned Home Assistant into a platform to write voice apps, no matter where the processing of the voice happens. This can be done by Alexa, Google Assistant or in the Home Assistant user interface.

We are super excited about the new functionality and hope that it will trigger a new type of applications and systems to be built on top of Home Assistant. To demo all this new functionality, we've included a new shopping list component. As a user you can add any item to the shopping list with your voice and also ask what is on your shopping list.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
shopping_list:
```

To make testing these applications easier, we've updated the conversation component. The component will now allow sentences to be configured that hook directly into the new voice functionality. Combined with the new interface it will allow for some great interactions!

[@OverloadUT] has been recently spending a lot of time on optimizing the history database queries. This release includes PR [#8632], the first in a list of improvements that he is working on. This PR greatly improves requests for single entities by using an optimized query for this use case.

The performance change in some of his tests shows this change to be about 300x faster (30 seconds to 0.1 seconds!) (There is no theoretical upper limit due to the issue with multi-entity queries getting worse the longer the current recorder run has been going.)

### Xiaomi integration

Yes, it has happened! After being in beta for a while, the Xiaomi support is now available to all. [@danielhiversen] did an amazing job and we now support sensors, switches, lights and covers.

### Velbus integration

Another awesome integration is that of the Velbus home automation system which has been contributed by [@thomasdelaet]. It integrates their sensors, covers, fans, lights and switches.

## New Platforms

- Initial support for Google Wifi/OnHub ([@fronzbot] - [#8485]) ([sensor.google_wifi docs]) (new-platform)

## Breaking Changes

- Automations: The state trigger keyword `state` and the time trigger keyword `after` were deprecated in 0.46. They have now been removed. ([@amelchio] - [#8510]) ([automation.state docs]) ([automation.time docs]) (breaking change)
- Wink: the component is no longer supporting the `access_token` in the config. Use the new OAuth authentication or add your username and password to the config. ([@w1ll1am23] - [#8208]) ([wink docs]) (breaking change)
- Alexa/API.AI/Snips.ai/Conversation: configuring responses to intents/sentences has been moved to a new component called `intent_script`. Conversation now allows configuring sentences to map to intents. ([@balloob] - [#8434]) ([alexa docs]) ([intent docs]) ([intent_script docs])
 ([shopping_list docs]) ([snips docs]) (breaking change) (new-platform)

Our already amazing frontend just got even more amazing thanks to [@andrey-git]. With the new theme support you can be in control of the primary color, accent color and a whole bunch more.

You can specify themes using new configuration options under frontend.

```yaml
frontend:
  themes:
    green:
      primary-color: #6ca518;
```

Not all parts of the user interface are themable yet. Expect improvements in future releases.

![localhost-8123-states](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1444314/28237031-da350c48-68ea-11e7-88b0-5fea7c131d0a.png)

## Kiosk mode

Another great new improvement for the frontend is the addition of a kiosk mode. When the frontend is viewed in kiosk mode, the tab bar will be hidden.

To activate kiosk mode, navigate to `https://hass.example.com:8123/kiosk/group.living_room_view`. Note that for `default_view` the url is just `https://hass.example.com:8123/kiosk`

This feature has also been brought to you by [@Andrey-git]! Big shout out to him for his continuous efforts to bring Home Assistant to the next level.

## New Platforms

- Add london_underground ([@robmarkcole] - [#8272]) ([sensor.tube_state docs]) (new-platform)
- Add citybikes platform ([@aronsky] - [#8202]) ([sensor.citybikes docs]) (new-platform)
- Add One-Time Password sensor (OTP) ([@postlund] - [#8332]) ([sensor.otp docs]) (new-platform)
- Add component for xiaomi robot vacuum (switch.xiaomi_vacuum) ([@rytilahti] - [#7913]) ([switch.xiaomi_vacuum docs]) (new-platform)

## Breaking Changes

- UPC Connect component no longer needs a password passed into the configuration. ([@Flavien] - [#8335]) ([device_tracker.upc_connect docs]) (breaking change)
- The Apple TV platform has been upgraded to a component and a remote platform has been added. This requires your Apple TV configuration to be moved to the new `apple_tv` component. ([@postlund] - [#8122]) ([media_player.apple_tv docs]) (breaking change)

```yaml
apple_tv:
  - name: Apple TV
    host: 10.0.10.20
    login_id: 00000000-1234-5678-9012-345678901234
    start_off: true
    credentials: 8660DEA5154FB46B:20B94847926112B3F46F85DB3A7311830463BF65570C22C3786E27F38C3326CF
```

- Refactored Amcrest to use central hub component to prepare for future integrations. This requires your Amcrest configuration to be moved to the new `amcrest` component. ([@tchellomello] - [#8184]) ([amcrest docs]) ([camera.amcrest docs]) ([sensor.amcrest docs]) (breaking change) (new-platform)

```yaml
amcrest:
  - host: !secret amcrest_living
    name: ""Living Room""
    username: !secret amcrest_living_username
    password: !secret amcrest_living_password
    resolution: low
    stream_source: snapshot
    sensors:
      - motion_detector
      - ptz_preset
```

6903194,2017-07-01T23:58:10Z,2017-07-01T23:58:46Z,0.48,"It's time for a great new release!

We've started the process of upgrading our frontend technology. If you notice something not working that did work before, please open [an issue][issue-polymer].

[Pascal][@pvizeli] has added a new option to Home Assistant core to set a list of whitelisted folders that Home Assistant can read from. When a component allows to send files (like Telegram), it will only be allowed to send files from those directories. The only default whitelisted folder is the public `<config>/www` directory.

Z-Wave will, as announced in the [last release](/blog/2017/06/17/release-47/), be defaulting to generate the new entity ids. More info in the [blog post](/blog/2017/06/15/zwave-entity-ids/). You can still opt-in for the old style.

```yaml
zwave:
  new_entity_ids: false
```

## Big speed up in querying the history

Thanks to the work by [@cmsimike] in [#8255] you'll see a significant speed up when using the history view. In his local tests queries went from 1 minute to 90ms! ⚡️ 

## Snips.ai component

Snips has contributed a component to integrate with their Snips.ai local voice assistant. This will allow you to hook a speaker and a microphone into your Raspberry Pi and make your own local Amazon Echo quickly. See [the docs][snips docs] for further instructions.

Also a shoutout to [@michaelarnauts] for keeping an eye on our Docker build and once again reducing the file size 👍

## Breaking Changes

- We have added a new option to whitelist folders that can be used as sources for sending files. You will need to use this option if you are using files with the telegram component. ([@pvizeli] - [#8189]) (breaking change)

```yaml
homeassistant:
  whitelist_external_dirs:
    - /tmp
    - /home/kenji/data
```

- Vera battery levels will no longer have the percent sign appended ([@philhawthorne] - [#8069]) ([vera docs]) (breaking change)
- Notify - SMTP: Added SMTP SSL/TLS support so now you should specify which encryption to use. ([@sn0oz] - [#7960]) ([notify.smtp docs]) (breaking change)

```
notify:
  - name: mail
    platform: smtp
    server: !secret smtp_server
    sender: !secret mail_alert
    username: !secret mail_username
    password: !secret mail_password
    recipient: !secret mail_admin
    encryption: tls  # Or starttls, none

6747794,2017-06-17T19:07:58Z,2017-06-17T19:08:52Z,0.47,"In this release a ton of new stuff! And who doesn't like new stuff? This release we're passing the 700 integrations for Home Assistant. As of today [we're 1369 days old][first-commit], which means that roughly every two days a new integration gets added!

## Python Scripts

The biggest change is a new type of script component: [Python scripts][python_script docs]. This new component will allow you to write scripts to manipulate Home Assistant: call services, set states and fire events. Each Python script is made available as a service. Head over to [the docs][python_script docs] to see how to get started.

## Updater

The updater has received a new opt-in option to let us know which components you use. This will allow us to focus development efforts on the components that are popular.

```yaml
updater:
  include_used_components: true
```

And as a reminder. We will never share gathered data in a manner that can be used to identify anyone. We do plan on making aggregate data public soon. This will include total number of users and which hardware/software platform people use to run Home Assistant.

## Z-Wave

Z-Wave is also getting a big update in this release. The confusing entity_ids will be on their way out. There is a [zwave blog post] that gives more detail, but the upgrade steps will be as follows:

1.	Run Home Assistant as normal and the old IDs will still be used.
2.	The new entity IDs will be shown in the more-info dialog for each entity. Check to make sure none of them will have conflicts once the new names are applied.
3.	Rename entities using the ui card as described in the blog post to avoid conflicts. Restart Home Assistant to observe the changes.
4.	Update all places mentioning IDs (groups, automation, customization, etc.) in configuration.yaml.
5.	Add `new_entity_ids: true` to your zwave config.
6.	Restart Home Assistant to run with new IDs.
7.	The old entity IDs will be available in the more info dialog to trace down any remaining errors.

## Breaking changes

- Update opencv config to match other image processors ([@Teagan42] - [#7864]) ([opencv docs]) ([image_processing.opencv docs]) (breaking change)

```yaml
image_processing:
  - platform: opencv
    name: OpenCV
    source:
      - entity_id: camera.front_door
    classifier:
      faces:
        file: /path/to/classifier
        name: Husband
        neighbors: 4
        min_size: (40, 40)
        scale: 1.1
```

- Lutron: Add configuration check and use default var names ([@fabaff] - [#7963]) ([lutron docs]) ([light.lutron docs]) (breaking change)

```yaml
lutron:
  host: IP_ADDRESS
  username: lutron
  password: integration
```

- Convert mailgun to component ([@happyleavesaoc] - [#7984]) ([mailgun docs]) ([notify.mailgun docs]) (breaking change) (new-platform)

```yaml
mailgun:
  domain: !secret mailgun_domain
  api_key: !secret mailgun_api_key
  sandbox: False

notify:
  - name: mailgun
    platform: mailgun
    recipient: !secret mailgun_recipient
```

- LIFX: add multiple modes to pulse effect. The `lifx_effect_breathe` call has been deprecated. Use `lifx_effect_pulse` with the new `mode: breathe` attribute instead. ([@amelchio] - [#8016]) ([light.lifx docs]) (breaking change)
- Use standard entity_ids for zwave entities. This also introduces a small API breakage, where `EVENT_SCENE_ACTIVATED` and `EVENT_NODE_EVENT` will no longer supply an `object_id`. They will now be tied to the node entity_id. ([@armills] - [#7786]) ([zwave docs]) ([light.zwave docs]) (breaking change)
- Fix attribute entities. Home Assistant will no longer filter out entities that are 'falsey'. So you might see more entity attributes show up. ([@pvizeli] - [#8066]) (breaking change)

6596199,2017-06-04T02:16:35Z,2017-06-04T02:17:06Z,0.46,"## New platforms

- Template light ([@cribbstechnologies] - [#7657]) ([light.template docs]) (new-platform)
- Support for GE Zwave fan controller ([@armills] - [#7767]) ([zwave docs]) ([fan.zwave docs]) (new-platform)
- Rachio (Sprinklers) ([@Klikini] - [#7600]) ([switch.rachio docs]) (new-platform)
- Introduced support to Netgear Arlo Cameras ([@tchellomello] - [#7826]) ([arlo docs]) ([camera.arlo docs]) ([sensor.arlo docs]) (new-platform)

## Breaking changes

- The USPS sensor entity names have changed as there are now two. One for packages and one for mail. Config will now also use `scan_interval` instead of `update_interval`  ([@happyleavesaoc] - [#7655]) ([sensor.usps docs]) (breaking change)
- Automation state trigger: From/to checks will now ignore state changes that are just attribute changess ([@amelchio] - [#7651]) ([automation.state docs]) (breaking change)
- Redesign monitored variables for hp_ilo sensor. `monitored_variables` is now a list of `name` and `sensor_type` values ([@Juggels] - [#7534]) ([sensor.hp_ilo docs]) (breaking change)

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: hp_ilo
    host: IP_ADDRESS or HOSTNAME
    username: USERNAME
    password: PASSWORD
    monitored_variables:
      - name: SENSOR NAME
        sensor_type: SENSOR TYPE
```

- Automation - time: the `after` keyword has been deprecated in favor of the `at` keyword. This resembles better what it does (old one still works, gives a warning) ([@armills] - [#7846]) ([automation.time docs]) (breaking change)
- Automation - numeric_state: `above` and `below` will no longer trigger if it is equal. ([@armills] - [#7857]) (breaking change)
- Broadlink switches: Entity ids will change for switches that don't have a default name set. In this case the object_id is now used. ([@abmantis] - [#7845]) ([switch.broadlink docs]) (breaking change)
- Disallow ambiguous color descriptors in the light.turn_on schema. This means that you can no longer specify both `xy_color` and `rgb_color`. ([@amelchio] - [#7765]) ([light.__init__ docs]) (breaking change)

6453077,2017-05-22T07:25:48Z,2017-05-22T08:43:08Z,0.45,"Welcome to another great release of Home Assistant! While some of contributors and users are gathering at PyCon US 2017, we still managed to get a great release together!

First thing for this release is a feature that has been requested a lot: an automation editor! It's still experimental - and many things are still in progress - but it works! You can create new automations and edit existing ones. If you start a new config, you're all good to go. Otherwise check [these instructions](https://home-assistant.io/docs/automation/editor/) to get your automations ready for editing in the UI.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1444314/26228446/b8664998-3bee-11e7-8a64-2d4c7af0cd9e.png)

As the editor is experimental, there are some limitations. These include that Chrome is the only supported browser, we don't support all triggers and actions and there is no support for conditions yet. But the foundation is there and so if you want to contribute to this, come help! 

On the Z-Wave front a lot has happened. The biggest one is that we have a major extension of the Z-Wave panel thanks to [@turbokongen]! You will now be able to change config parameters and manage your devices.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16622752/26245366/0cfe83ee-3c94-11e7-839f-56f423a2eb8e.png)

Thanks to the work by the Python Open Z-Wave team we are now able to install it on demand from PyPi! There is no longer a need to pre-compile it yourself. This should give us the guarantee that we work with the Python Open Z-Wave version that the code expects. **Warning:** If you have a security key set in your Open Z-Wave `options.xml`, copy `options.xml` to your Home Assistant configuration directory. This is the only place where options will get persisted.

Next to that [@armills] has lead the charge and managed to get full test coverage for Z-Wave! Thanks for all the hard work!

This release also contains two integrations which could help you to make non-smart devices a little smarter. The [`file` sensor][sensor.file docs] and the [`seven_segments` OCR image processing platform][image_processing.seven_segments docs]. The first simply reads a plain-text file which was created by a logger or alike. The latter one extracts the value from a captured image that shows a seven-segments display.

![power-meter](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/116184/26277681/a36f49f0-3d8c-11e7-82dd-9b0040d6840c.png)

And last, but not least, our Docker image is now based off Python 3.6. This version is faster and uses less memory than Python 3.5. Win!

If you are using our [experimental Hass.io image][hass.io], we made a breaking change in how the panel is served. If you have an existing installation, make sure you update your supervisor to the latest version before updating Home Assistant. If you are going to flash a new Hass.io image, make sure to only flash the new 0.8 image as linked on [the installation page][hass.io-install].

For the people that have been following on social media, you might have noticed that [we got pretty excited about the new IKEA Tradfri line up][ikea-blog]. And so we are very happy to announce that thanks to the work by [@ggravlingen], [@MartinHjelmare] and myself that this will be the first release to support the IKEA light bulbs. Home Assistant will automatically detect the gateway on your network and after following the instructions, allow you to control your lights.

And in case you have missed the other big news: [@robbiet480] released the [first version of our iOS app][ios]! It took a little over a year but it offers some great ways to make your iDevice work with Home Assistant. Big congrats to Robbie for shipping! As with our other parts, the app is open-sourced under APACHE 2 and contributors are welcome. [Check it out.][ios-source]

A big shout out this release to [@happyleavesaoc] for his constant stream of great contributions to Home Assistant. The first contribution was back in October 2015 and since then @happyleavesaoc has been responsible for many platforms and bug fixes including the Spotify platform this release. Thanks @happyleavesaoc, you're a great example of what makes our community awesome.

The new Spotify integration is based on the new Spotify Connect Playback API. It supports playback, album art and switching which Spotify device you're controlling.

## Breaking changes

- We were incorrectly treating groups named `default_view` as default views. Make sure you set `view: true` in the config for these groups. [#251 (frontend)](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/pull/251)
- The last release introduced a revamped LIFX platform. We only realised after deploy that this version does not work on Windows. We have added the old LIFX implementation back as `lifx_legacy`.
- We added indexes to the database to speed up the history view. Initial boot can take a couple of minutes. Do not shut down while migration is occurring. [#6688]
- Z-Wave cover workaround has been removed. Use device config instead. [#6832]

```yaml
zwave:
  device_config:
    cover.my_cover:
      invert_openclose_buttons: true
```

- If you set an initial state for an automation, input_boolean, input_slider or input_select it will overrule over the previous state. [#6911] [#6924]
- Z-Wave rename node service parameter `entity_id` has been replaced with `node_id` to align parameters [#6938]
- Automations are now initialized when Home Assistant finishes starting up. This means that it is deprecated to listen for event `homeassistant_start`. Instead, use the new `homeassistant` automation platform. [#6936]

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
```

- The Ring component has moved the authentication to a dedicated ring component. [#6520]

```yaml
ring:
    username: !secret ring_username
    password: !secret ring_password

binary_sensor:
  - platform: ring
    monitored_conditions:
      - ding
      - motion

sensor:
  - platform: ring
    monitored_conditions:
      - battery
      - last_activity
      - last_ding
      - last_motion
      - volume
```

5869132,2017-03-25T23:01:49Z,2017-03-25T23:03:14Z,0.41,"Welcome to 0.41. There was a lot going on in the last two weeks. Not only from the code side but also from the social one of Home Assistant. [Paulus][@balloob] did an [interview] with [OpenSourceCraft], [Fabian][@fabaff] did a [workshop] at the [Chemnitzer Linux Tage][clt], and we are now an award-winning Open source project (I will cover that in a separate blog post). 

## Plex
[@JesseWebDotCom] made massive changes to the [Plex][plex] media player platform. From better metadata support over new configuration options to improved controls and non-controllable clients. 

## Component overview
The [Components][components] overview is now powered by search/filtering feature. This will make it faster to get the component/platform you are looking for more quickly. Thanks again, [@bdurrer] for this.

 ## Changelog
The new format of the changelog which was introduced with 0.40 will provide a link to the related pull request. We are not covering everything in our release notes but we think that this addition will make it easier to find details about the change.

## New platforms/components

- Support for [Tado][tado] climate devices ([@wmalgadey])
- [Volumio][volumio] media player added ([@jslove])
- [Workday][workday] sensor ([@BastianPoe])

## Breaking changes

- The [Kodi notifier][kodi] platform was migrated to async and the configuration synced with the Kodi media player platform ([#6497]).
- For the [Music Player Daemon][mpd] (MPD) platform was `location` replaced with `name` ([#6553]).
- Event decorators were removed ([#6634]).
- The [Emby mediaplayer][emby] platform was changed to avoid name clashes ([#6664]).
- In a lot of places were the power and energy units update. This change mostly affects the `switch` platforms ([#6212]).
- If set to `auto` then the [MQTT][mqtt] implementation will use the bundled certificates automatically ([#6707]).

## If you need help...
...don't hesitate to use our very active [forums][forum] or join us for a little [chat][gitter]. The release notes have comments enabled but it's preferred if you use the former communication channels. Thanks.

Big thanks to [@pvizeli] for driving this effort. Startup is now super fast. We have also continued with adding warnings for components and platforms that are slowing down Home Assistant.

Some people have interpreted our recent added warnings as if 0.39 introduced the issues that caused the warning. This is not the case, the platforms and components have been misbehaving for a while but now we are adding warnings so we are able to track down the culprits.

Before we continue talking about all the improvements in this release I want to take a moment to thank a few people from the Home Assistant community that are fundamental to the success of Home Assistant. Big thanks to [@dale3h], [@CCOSTAN], [@skalavala] [@rrubin0] [@brahmafear] [@bassclarinetl2] and [@torn8o]! These are all people that hang out in our [main chat channel] and help new users get started and help existing users when running into trouble. Home Assistant would not be there without all the effort you put in! 🙇 

## Z-Wave is now threadsafe

[@andrey-git] has spend a lot of time to make Z-Wave perform better. It should no longer cause Home Assistant to run slower or raise warnings about the timer getting out of sync.

## Update on the MQTT Out of Memory errors in 0.39

MQTT started causing ""Out of Memory"" errors for some people on a Raspberry Pi. We have been able to track this down to Raspberry Pis that are using an older firmware. If you are experiencing this issue, please [upgrade your firmware using `rpi-update`](https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update#installing).

## Android IP Camera

With the new support for [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam) added by [@robbiet480] and [@pvizeli] you are now able to re-purpose any Android phone to become a multifunctional IP webcam.

 - Add the Android device camera as a camera in Home Assistant
 - Binary sensor when motion is detected
 - Sensors to expose the device sensors, including pressure, sound, battery, light
 - Control device features like the GPS, night vision and camera flash

![Default layout](http://d.pr/i/dcm3+)

## Other Highlights

 - Support added for Austrian weather using Zamg weather data ([@Zac-HD])
 - AppleTV has been converted to push data to Home Assistant instead of us having to poll ([@postlund])
 - Ring.com video doorbell integration added ([@tchellomello])
 - Blink Home Security Camera support added ([@fronzbot])

## Breaking changes

- Vera entity ids have changed. This is a one time change to migrate to a model that will prevent future conflicts.
- The Twilio notify platforms now have to be configured via the twilio component. 

```yaml
twilio:
  account_sid: ""abc""
  auth_token: ""xyz""
```

- If you are using async custom components, the passed in `async_add_devices` method is now a callback instead of a coroutine.

## T-Shirts

First off, in case you haven't seen it yet: [we have t-shirts](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/22/home-assistant-tshirts-have-arrived/) now and they are beautiful. All proceeds from the shirts will be donated to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The first three days all of you have already raised $400! Still waiting for Teespring to get back to me so stay tuned for the EU store.

## Reorganised documentation

First off I want to say thank you to [Fabian](https://github.com/fabaff). He did an amazing job in re-organizing our documentation. Is it perfect yet? No. But we are getting close. We put a lot of focus on making sure the Raspberry Pi is the main focus of our getting started. The other instructions are still available, just not as part of the main getting started.

## State restoration

Ever have some input components or integrations and get annoyed with the fact that their state is lost after a restart? Don't worry any longer. [Johann](https://github.com/kellerza) has added the foundation for state restoration to Home Assistant. For the initial release support has been added to to `input_select` and `input_boolean` components. We will be adding this to more integrations in the future.

## Configuration panel

Yep, you read that right. We have a configuration panel. It's just the first of many small steps. Putting in a foundation is important and gives us something to iterate on.

To start, we have three simple configuration panels:
- Core: allows you to validate config, reload core/group/automation config and restart/stop Home Assistant
- Group: allows you to rename groups, change type between group/view and reorder entities.
- Z-Wave: allows you to set device specific configuration settings

As a security measure, the configuration panel will need to be activated in the config file to be activated. This can be done by adding the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

``` yalm
config:
```

Using our configuration panels will require you to structure your groups and Z-Wave device config according to how the configuration panel expects it. This is on purpose as it we will not be aiming to build a system that supports both our extended set of configuration extend hooks and our configuration panels. It's one or the other.

To activate them in your config, create empty files `groups.yaml` and `zwave_device_config.yaml` in your config dir and add the following entries to your config:

``` yaml
groups: !include groups.yaml

zwave:
  device_config: !include zwave_device_config.yaml
```

_Note that this is the first release. Things will be missing, things will be broken._

## Breaking changes to customize and Z-Wave ""customize""

A couple of releases ago we introduced a new way of doing `customize`. It became a list that allowed different ways of matching the config to the entity.

We realized that this was leading into a rabbit hole that we had to get out off. Besides making it unnecessarily complicated it also blocked the road to config panels. And who doesn't like config panels?

So starting this release, we had to make some breaking changes to right the wrong. We will be releasing an online tool to help you convert your config to the new format later today.

#### Customize has been reverted to it's original config

The old customize is back. The options to match by domain or using glob have been moved to it's own options. It will now look like this:

``` yaml
homeassistant:
  customize:
    light.kitchen:
      hidden: true
  customize_domain:
    light:
      icon: mdi:home
  customize_glob:
    ""light.kitchen_*"":
      icon: mid:description
```

#### Z-Wave customize is now device config

Ever wondered why the Z-Wave customize was called customize? Yeah, so did we. So when migrating this to the new config format, we decided to upgrade the name too:

``` yaml
zwave:
  device_config:
    light.kitchen:
      ignored: true
  device_config_domain:
    light:
      polling_intensity: 2
  device_config_glob:
    ""light.kitchen_*"":
      polling_intensity: 0
```

## Speed improvements

And a final shout out to [Pascal](https://github.com/pvizeli). He keeps improving the performance of components and platforms all over Home Assistant.

### Core updates
- Thanks to [@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli), all the core components are now written asynchronously. All entity components are now migrated from synchronously to asynchronously code!
- Now when you restart Home Assistant using the `homeassistant.restart` service, your configuration is checked. If it appears to be invalid the restart will fail.

### Rewritten frontend

The frontend has been completely been rewritten, optimizing for speed and lost connection recovery. Even on the slowest phones it should fly now. The frontend also now uses the new [WebSockets API](https://home-assistant.io/developers/websocket_api/) instead of the [EventStream API](https://home-assistant.io/developers/server_sent_events/).

### Custom state card UI

A nice new feature is the possibility to create [custom state cards](https://home-assistant.io/developers/frontend_creating_custom_ui/) in the frondend. Go ahead and write your own state card for [lights](https://home-assistant.io/cookbook/custom_ui_by_andrey-git), sensors, locks, etc.

### MQTT discovery

MQTT now has [discovery](https://home-assistant.io/components/mqtt/#discovery) support which is different than our [`discovery`](https://home-assistant.io/components/discovery/) component. Similar to the HTTP sensor and HTTP binary sensor, MQTT discovery removes the need for configuration by allowing devices to make their presence known to Home Assistant.

### Alert component

If you left your front door open, then the new [`alert`](https://home-assistant.io/components/alert/) component can be used to remind you of this by sending you repeating notifications at a given interval.

### Yeelight

The [`yeelight`](https://home-assistant.io/components/light.yeelight/) component has been ported to use a more stable and feature-complete [python-yeelight](https://gitlab.com/stavros/python-yeelight) backend, and supports now both white and RGB bulbs. The component also supports transitions and can be configured to save the settings to the bulb on changes. The users currently using custom components for Yeelight are encouraged to move back to use the included version and report any problems with it to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues).

### Apple TV

[Apple TV](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.apple_tv/) is now a supported [`media_player`](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player/)! It has support for just about every media player function, including a realtime display of playback status and artwork.

### Breaking changes
- The support for [LG webOS Smart TVs](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.webostv/) was improved. This requires you to move `$HOME/.pylgtv` to `$HASS_CONFIG_DIR/webostv.conf` or Home Assistant will need to be paired with the TV again.
- Image processing events have been renamed: `identify_face` has become `image_processing.detect_face`, `found_plate` has become `image_processing.found_plate`
- The [FFmpeg binary sensor](https://home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor.ffmpeg/) change the platform name from `ffmpeg` to `ffmpeg_noise` and `ffmpeg_motion`. Also all FFmpeg-related services are moved from a platform implementation to a the [FFmpeg components](https://home-assistant.io/components/ffmpeg/) and were rename from `binary_sensor.ffmpeg_xy` to `ffmpeg.xy`.

### Governance

As announced, the new [Governance](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/21/home-assistant-governance/) requires for developers to sign the CLA. [Code of Conduct](https://home-assistant.io/developers/code_of_conduct/), [Contributor License Agreement](https://home-assistant.io/developers/cla/), and proper [Licensing](https://home-assistant.io/developers/license/) will to protect all involved parties in the Home Assistant eco-system from users and community members to contributors. 

### Face recognition using the Microsoft Face API

[@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli) has been on a roll with the image processing integrations. This time it's the [Microsoft Face API](https://home-assistant.io/components/microsoft_face/). This means that now it will be possible to train the API with the people you want to recognize and send images from your camera to the API as another source of automation.

Want to play a personalized tune when someone enters the house? It is now possible 😎

### Improved camera security

After a security audit by Stephen O'Conner, he found that our source for randomly generated access tokens for camera feeds were reasonable predictable and could be brute force attacked in 2.5 weeks. A fix has been included in this release that uses the system provided random number generator for maximum randomness and rotates the keys every 10 minutes to reduce the window in which a brute force attack can happen.

Although the old method is not insecure, the new method is a lot more secure. Upgrading to the latest version is encouraged.

### New customization options

[@Andrey-git](https://github.com/andrey-git) has added some great new options to the customize functionality. It is now possible to specify customizations as a wildcard for entities or for a specific domain.

### Major Wink and HDMI CEC improvements

[@w1ll1am23](https://github.com/w1ll1am23) did an amazing job fixing a ton of bugs and issues with the Wink integration. Biggest improvement is that it now is able to automatically refresh the authentication tokens. This means that if you have your email address and password in your `configuration.yaml` file, no `client_id` and `client_secret` are needed, and token which was generated with the generator located in the [Wink](https://home-assistant.io/components/wink/) documentation.

The new Wink support will cause renaming of all the binary sensors and will also create new sensors for devices that weren't previously detected or supported in the older version. 

Thanks to [@konikvranik](https://github.com/konikvranik) the [HDMI CEC](https://home-assistant.io/components/hdmi_cec/) integration got a huge update with a lot of improvements. This update should make it easier to work with HDMI CEC and give you more control.

### First Coffee Maker supported

[@stu-gott](https://github.com/stu-gott) has added support for the first coffee maker in Home Assistant: [Mr. Coffee Smart Optimal Brew](https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.wemo/). Happy brewing!

### Breaking changes
- A **major** breaking change in the [`emulated_hue`](https://home-assistant.io/components/emulated_hue/) component means that without changing a configuration value before starting up the newer Home Assistant version you will lose all devices that Alexa has discovered and will need to re-add them as well as create new groups. Find out about the [details](emul_hue).
- The platform of the [ISS](https://home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor.iss/) integration was change to `binary_sensor`. Please check the platform documentation.
- The [Roku](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.roku/) media uses now a new format for the entity IDs.
- [OpenALPR](https://home-assistant.io/components/#image-processing) is no longer a component. It's now a platform for [Image processing](https://home-assistant.io/components/image_processing/).
- Due to massive improvements of the [Wink](https://home-assistant.io/components/wink/) integration, the names of your binary sensors will change and new devices can show up.
- The [MySensors](https://home-assistant.io/components/mysensors/) component now requires all persistence file paths to be set if any is set by the user. This is to avoid name conflicts for the paths. If no path is set Home Assistant will set all paths for you.
- The [Sonos](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.sonos/) service `sonos_group_players` was removed. Use now `sonos_join` for this function.
- TTS cache have change for the last time. Files use now also a option hash as part of the name. If you want to use the cache, it need to be renamed or cleared, new created. E. g. `HASH_LANG_PLATFORM.xxx` -> `HASH_LANG_OPTIONS_PLATFORM.xxx`, replace _OPTIONS_ with `-` on exiting platforms.

## Packages

[Packages](https://home-assistant.io/topics/packages/) are providing a new way to organize different component's configuration parts together. With packages we offer the option to include different components or parts of configuration using any of the `!include` directives.

## InfluxDB export

The [InfluxDB](https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/) component was causing problems in a wide variety of use cases. [@titilambert](https://github.com/titilambert) improved our InfluxDB exporter feature. It might be that you need to run the [migration script](https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/#migration-script) to update your InfluxDB database.

``` bash
$ hass --script influxdb_migrator \
    -H IP_INFLUXDB_HOST -u INFLUXDB_USERNAME -p INFLUXDB_PASSWORD \
    -d INFLUXDB_DB_NAME
```

## International Space Station (ISS)

No, unfortunately we are not going to space. The `iss` sensor is tracking the position of the International Space Station and gives your some details. 

## Insteon local

The support for Insteon was removed due to issues. With the `insteon_local` component support for [Insteon](https://home-assistant.io/components/insteon_local/) is back. 

## Image processing

The new [image processing component](https://home-assistant.io/components/image_processing/) currently works with [number plates](https://home-assistant.io/components/openalpr/). But this could level the way to integrate feature like facial recognition or gestures control.

### Breaking changes
- [APNS](https://home-assistant.io/components/notify.apns/) service was moved to the `notify` domain. Use `notify.apns_NOTIFIER_NAME` instead of `apns.NOTIFIER_NAME`.
- InfluxDB component has a new [schema](https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/#data-migration) to store values in the influx db. You may require to run the [`influxdb_migrator`](https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/#migration-script) script.
  You have to note:
  - There will not be any tags/fields named time anymore.
  - All numeric fields (int/float/bool) will be stored as float inside influx db.
  - All string fields corresponding to state attributes will be renamed as FIELDNAME_str, where FIELDNAME is the state attribute, to avoid type conflicts.
  - All string fields corresponding to a state will be renamed as state (former value).
  - Fields named value will always be stored as float.
  - Fields named state will always be stored as string.

I don't think we could wish for a better place to be at the end of 2016. Feels like an early Christmas present! Our early one for you is 0.35. It's not a single thing inside a nice wrapping, more like several little gifts inside the 0.35 box.

This will be the last release of 2016 as our developers are taking a well deserved break. We will be back in 2017!

## Text to Speech

With the addition of a [text-to-speech](https://home-assistant.io/components/tts/) component by [@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli) we have been able to bring Home Assistant to a whole new level. The text-to-speech component will take in any text and will play it on a media player that supports to play media. We have tested this on Sonos, Chromecast, and Google Home.

## Call for help with HASSbian (our Raspberry Pi image)

In an effort to make Home Assistant, we're planning to extend the things that people can do out of the box with HASSbian, our Raspberry Pi image. As you might know, the image is currently maintained by [@Landrash](https://github.com/Landrash). However he also spends a lot of time on improving the docs and helping out with a ton of other things.

So if you know your Linux-foo and would love to contribute to open source, join the [Hassbian developer chat](https://gitter.im/home-assistant/hassbian) and take a stab at one of [our open issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/pi-gen/issues).

## VLC media player, Broadlink, and GPSLogger

Let you control [VLC media player](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.vlc/) and  play sound on connected speakers.

This Broadlink [switch](https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.broadlink/) platform allow to you control Broadlink RM2 Pro and RM mini IR+RF devices. This Broadlink [sensor](https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.broadlink/) platform adds support for Broadlink RM2 and A1 Devices.

The [GPSLogger](https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker.gpslogger/) now also supports attributes as the speed, direction, altitude, provider and activity.

Of course, more work on async programming done by [@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli) and [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob), a new components, new platforms, major improvements, and much more.

### GPSLogger

The work of [@dainok](https://github.com/dainok) let you use your Android device, with the Geolocation feature enabled, to track itself using the GPS sensor or WiFi networks with [GPSLogger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger) app. GPSLogger can use multiple source: the passive one just get the latest Android known location, without activating GPS sensors or scanning for WiFi networks.

### Remote component

The brand new [`remote`](https://home-assistant.io/components/remote/) component made by [@iandday](https://github.com/iandday) will simplyfy the integration of all kind remote control units. The first platform for [Harmony](https://home-assistant.io/components/remote.harmony/) is included in this release.

### HomeMatic

The [HomeMatic](https://home-assistant.io/components/homematic/) component has received some updates worth mentioning:
- Additional services
  - `reconnect`: Reconnect to your CCU/Homegear without restarting Home Assistant.
  - `set_dev_value`: Manually control a device, even if it's not supported by Home Assistant yet.
- Support for multiple HomeMatic hosts
- Support for HomeMatic Wired (most devices) and HomeMatic IP (a few devices)
- Various improvements and fixes, especially for HM-Sec-Key (KeyMatic)

The support for multiple hosts is a result of allowing mixed configurations with wireless, wired, and IP devices. This has the drawback of making the update a breaking change (along with the renamed `set_value` service). However, the benefits and possibilities gained will be worth it.

### Websocket API

This release includes a new [websockets](https://home-assistant.io/developers/websockets_api/) based API by [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob) to power the next generation of Home Assistant frontends. The current frontend has been partly migrated to use it and will be further migrated in the future.

If you are using NGINX, you will have to adapt your config. [See the instructions.](https://home-assistant.io/ecosystem/nginx/)

But a new release wouldn’t be awesome if it didn’t had some new goodies and this release is no different. This release includes a new calendar component by @mnestor. It comes now with Google Calendar support, which should allow you to automate things based on your calendar events!

## Changes
- New [calendar component](https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.google_calendar/) including Google support ([@mnestor](https://github.com/mnestor))
- Final core upgrade for async ([@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli))

- Light - Hue: Add service to [activate scenes](https://home-assistant.io/components/light.hue/) defined in Hue app ([@sdague](https://github.com/sdague))

## Breaking changes
- We have included a fix that impacts how we generate entity ids. This only impacts devices with accented characters. Instead of being stripped out, they are now replaced with the non-accented version. So now `Tèst Mörê` will become `test_more` instead of `tst_mr`.
- Command line switches will now use the specified object ID for their entity ID instead of basing it off the name.

### Hacktoberfest

The [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is over now. Home Assistant made the 2nd and the 3rd place out of almost 30'000 participating repositories with a total of 528 pull requests closed - that's an average of 17 pull requests a day! Thanks to all the contributors but also to the team of reviewers. This wouldn't been possible without you 👏 .

### Improved error reporting

This release has improved the reporting when a config validation error occurs. Thanks to [@kellerza](https://github.com/kellerza) you will now get a persistent notification added to your UI when this happens.

### Asynchronous

This release contains the first asynchronous sensor and camera platforms. [@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli) and [@fabaff](https://github.com/fabaff) ported most of the ""internal"" sensors to async programming. We hope that you will enjoy the new speed. 

[@balloob](https://github.com/balloob) and [@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli) worked a lot on the improvement of the core itself.

### Weather component

For a long time we have had a bunch of [weather sensors](https://home-assistant.io/components/#weather) but it's getting better: There is now a [Weather component](https://home-assistant.io/components/weather/). Sorry, not much more to tell right now. The plans are to create a weather UI element and to improve the initial implementation.

4458619,2016-10-22T22:22:07Z,2016-10-22T22:24:01Z,0.31,"Hello again friend,

How are you? Having a good day? We sure are. If you aren't having a good day, this might cheer you up...

Every other weekend around here gets a little hectic leading to a big sigh of relief as we release a new version of Home Assistant to the world. And this time is no different. Our developer community has once again built us a beautiful new release with lots of new features and improvements. We hope you like it.

One last thing before we get going though, I should warn you... [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob) got a bit lazy this week and let me ([@robbiet480](https://github.com/robbiet480)) step up to the plate again to write the blog post and do the release. I guess I didn't do such a bad job in [0.27](/blog/2016/08/28/notifications-hue-fake-unification/). You'll never know what surprises I have in store. Now that i've got all that stuff out of the way, let's get started...

## Stats Update

Sadly, no big amazing stats to update you with this time, but we did recently pass 7,000 commits! This release featured submissions from 45 contributors. Hopefully with the new updater component we will be able to give you some really good stats in the 0.32 blog post.

## Hacktoberfest

![Hacktoberfest logo](https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2016-10-hacktoberfest/hacktoberfest.png)

October means Hacktoberfest time and our community has really come through with some excellent improvements and additions. As of this writing, we have 194 merged and 41 open pull requests to the [home-assistant repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/labels/Hacktoberfest) and 209 merged/28 open pull requests submitted to the [home-assistant.github.io repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.github.io/labels/Hacktoberfest). If you want to get in on the fun check out our [Hacktoberfest](/blog/2016/10/02/hacktoberfest/) blog post or the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). You get an awesome t-shirt for free if you have 4 pull requests merged in the month of October! We even have tasks that a non-developer can easily accomplish with a tiny bit of work. Better hurry up though, only 9 days left and most of the easy tasks are gone!

## ⚠️ A greatly improved updater component (Please read this!) ⚠️

This release includes an update to our [updater](https://home-assistant.io/components/updater/) component. The responsibility of the updater component is to check if a new version is available and notify the user if this is the case.

It used to be that this component would check with [PyPi](the Python package manager) to see if a new update was available. This had a couple of problems:
1. We are unable to do a slow rollout
2. We are unable to show the user extra information (like a link to a changelog or the release date)
3. We are unable to warn users for critical security updates

So to work around these problems, we decided to start hosting the version check service ourselves. Since we had to get some infrastructure spun up anyway, we figured we would take it a step further. Which leads me to this bit of the update (the most important part):

### What you need to know (the important bit!)

Remember how I mentioned that up there in the title that there is some serious business in this release? Well, we also added some basic analytics to the updater component which get sent to the server and stored so that we get a better idea of our user base.

Each Home Assistant instance running the updater component will generate a [unique ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) (based on UUIDv4) that will be used for the updater to be able to differentiate between instances. This UUID will be stored in your config directory in a file called `.uuid`.

#### Opting out

There are two ways to opt-out. The first way is by using the new `opt_out` option for the updater. This way the updater will continue to check for updates, but no information about your system will be shared with us.

``` yaml
updater:
  reporting: no
```

You can also disable the updater component entirely by removing `updater:` from your `configuration.yaml` although **we would not suggest you do this** as you would miss any critical security updates.

Finally, you can also reset your unique identifier by deleting the `.uuid` file and restarting Home Assistant.

#### Data stored on the Home Assistant update server

Here is what my production Home Assistant instance looks like from the server side:

| Name | Description | Example | Data Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `arch` | CPU Architecture | `x86_64` | Local Instance |
| `distribution` | Linux Distribution name (only Linux) | `Ubuntu` | Local Instance |
| `docker` | True if running inside Docker | `false` | Local Instance |
| `first_seen_datetime` | First time instance ID was submitted | `2016-10-22T19:56:03.542Z` | Update Server |
| `geo_city` | GeoIP determined city | `Oakland` | Update Server |
| `geo_country_code` | GeoIP determined country code | `US` | Update Server |
| `geo_country_name` | GeoIP determined country name | `United States` | Update Server |
| `geo_latitude` | GeoIP determined latitude | `37.8047` | Update Server |
| `geo_longitude` | GeoIP determined longitude | `-122.2124` | Update Server |
| `geo_metro_code` | GeoIP determined metro code | `807` | Update Server |
| `geo_region_code` | GeoIP determined region code | `CA` | Update Server |
| `geo_region_name` | GeoIP determined region name | `California` | Update Server |
| `geo_time_zone` | GeoIP determined time zone | `America/Los_Angeles` | Update Server |
| `geo_zip_code` | GeoIP determined zip code | `94602` | Update Server |
| `last_seen_datetime` | Most recent time instance ID was submitted | `2016-10-22T19:56:03.542Z` | Update Server |
| `os_name` | Operating system name | `Darwin` | Local Instance |
| `os_version` | Operating system version | `10.12` | Local Instance |
| `python_version` | Python version | `3.5.2` | Local Instance |
| `timezone` | Timezone | `America/Los_Angeles` | Local Instance |
| `user_agent` | User agent used to submit analytics | `python-requests/2.11.1` | Local Instance |
| `uuid` | Unique identifier | `10321ee6094d4a2ebb5ed55c675d5f5e` | Local Instance |
| `version` | Home Assistant version | `0.31.0` | Local Instance |
| `virtualenv` | True if running inside virtualenv | `true` | Local Instance |

In addition to the above collected data, the server will also use your IP address to do a geographic IP address lookup to determine a general geographic area that your address is located in. To be extremely, extremely clear about this bit: **The Home Assistant updater does not: store your IP address in a database and also does not submit the location information from your `configuration.yaml`.** Our tests show that at best, we get 4 digits of accuracy on your IP address location which is a 5 mile radius of your actual IP location, assuming that it is even correct in the first place (geo IP look ups are very hit or miss). Here's what the accuracy looks like for my data above: ![Robbie's GeoIP accuracy level](https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2016-10-flash-briefing-updater-hacktoberfest/map.png)

The server also adds two timestamps to the data: the original date your instance UUID was first seen and the timestamp of the last time we have seen your instance.

This data is held in the highest security. The update system runs in a secured Amazon Web Services account owned by me ([@robbiet480](https://github.com/robbiet480)). I personally have 5 years of experience with complex AWS deployments and have an extensive security background. I have audited the entire system and made sure to take every step to protect the data, including limiting who has access (just [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob) and myself). While not directly personally identifiable we absolutely understand some users hesistance to giving this information out. Please understand that we are only collecting this information to better understand our user base to provide better long term support and feature development then is currently possible.

We currently have no plans to publicly expose any of this information. If we did do such a thing in the future we would of course notify you in advance. It must also be stated that we will never sell or allow the use of this information for non-Home Assistant purposes.

We thank you for understanding why we are collecting this data and hope that you leave the feature enabled but fully understand if you feel uncomfortable with this.

Now, back to the fun stuff...

## Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy and here's what happening in your world tonight.

Home Assistant got a crazy idea recently that it couldn't do enough already and wanted to challenge itself even more. I really don't understand how it came up with this kooky idea, but it now thinks that its newest hobby should be a minor career in journalism.

0.31 adds support for the brand spanking new [Alexa Flash Briefing API](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/flash-briefing), allowing you to get updates from Home Assistant anytime you ask Alexa to read your flash briefing. What's the use case you ask? Well, now when I wake up in the morning and get my flash briefing, Home Assistant adds this to the end of it for me:

> Drive time with traffic is 35 minutes. There is an UberPOOL that will cost $11.52, estimated to be 2 minutes away, for a total of 37 minutes. BART is currently estimated to take 29 minutes. You should take BART, as it is estimated to be faster by 8 minutes.

Now I know how to best get to [my real job](https://runway.is) (no, Home Assistant is _not_ my real job, it does seem like it sometimes though) every morning. Obviously not the best home automation example, but I think you get the idea. I could see this being used to tell you any major events that happened in your home overnight or reading you your hyperlocal weather report. Thanks to the audio support you could even replace all of the default Alexa Flash Briefing sources with your own news feeds. Home Assistant supports both text and audio content as well as displaying data in the Alexa app. I also want to point out that unlike the existing Skill integration, the Flash Briefing API does _not_ require HTTPS (_but you should still be using HTTPS if possible_). For more information, check out the new [docs](https://home-assistant.io/components/alexa/).

## Major breaking Z-Wave changes ahead

A rather nasty Z-Wave [issue](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/3759) was discovered recently by [@lukas-hetzenecker](https://github.com/lukas-hetzenecker). There was a somewhat large chance that if you had multiple of the same model Z-Wave device they may both try to use the same entity IDs. To fix the issue the internal Z-Wave index is now appended to the end of all Z-Wave entity IDs.

What this means for all you Z-Wave users is that you will need to update your configurations to reflect the change. I personally have quite a few (17) Z-Wave devices and went through the process this week. Here's what I had to do:
- Update customizations
- Update groups
- Update my `zwave.customize` section
- Update my Alexa skills that used old entity IDs
- Because I use `emulated_hue` with Alexa and `emulated_hue` uses the entity ID as a unique identifier I also had to remove all Z-Wave devices from Alexa and re-add them.

Your todo list may be a little different from mine, I just wanted to outline the steps I took to give you an idea of what you need to think about. It's not a very hard process, especially when using global find and replace in Sublime Text but did take me about 20 minutes to complete.

This is super annoying, I know, especially since we had said in [0.12](/blog/2016/01/30/insteon-lifx-twitter-and-zigbee/#backwards-incompatible-changes) that Z-Wave IDs should hopefully never change again, but we are now forced to eat those words. I will state again that Z-Wave IDs shouldn't change in the future but obviously we see how that went. To sum up on this section... sorry but it had to happen.

We guess that you already know: The [Raspberry Pi image](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/10/01/we-have-raspberry-image-now/) is available now. For Hassbian, [@Landrash](https://github.com/Landrash) has combined the most essential parts for a Home Assistant setup in an easy-to-use image for the Raspberry Pi device family. Hassbian is quite young, thus we are looking forward to recieve [feedback](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/hassbian), [issue report](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/hassbian), and [suggestions](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/hassbian) to improve it. 

A large amount of resources of the development are still focusing on the effort to move Home Assistant further to asynchronous programming. It's a labor-intensive task, comes with segmentation faults, and unstable instances when certain combinations of sensors are used. The benefit will be more speed in the near future.

To reduce the run-time of your tests, [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob) did a lot of tweaking. For now the RFXtrx tests are excluded which cut the needed time for running on your Pull Request in half. 

### Documentation

All configuration sample entries are now minimized. This should help to avoid problem for starters and newbies as they only get what's needed and not a full sample with all optional entries. If there is an issue with an entry in your `configuration.yaml` file the error message will provide you an URL that point to documentation.

![config-validation-url](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/116184/19124435/7c43fe0e-8b33-11e6-93cf-ec982ca0705d.png)

As soon as the [Hacktoberfest](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/10/02/hacktoberfest/) started there were a lot of incoming Pull Requests for the documentation. A huge ""Thank you"" to all participants. Especially, we would like to give a cookie to [@hillaryfraley](https://github.com/hillaryfraley). She created around a dozen Pull Requests so far and didn't only fix typos but complete sections. The [Hacktoberfest](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/10/02/hacktoberfest/) is still on-going and we are looking forward to get more Pull Requests.

### Statistics

With the [statistics sensor](https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.statistics/) we would like to introduce a new sensor that is similar to the [template sensor](https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.template/) or the [trend sensor](https://home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor.trend/). This sensor is consuming values from another sensor and is doing some statistical analysis of the data. Over a group of samples is the average/mean, the min/max, the total, the standard deviation, and the variance calculated which can be used in your automation rules. If the source is a binary sensor then the state changes are counted.

![stats-sensor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/116184/19124505/c8fcd4b4-8b33-11e6-8aaf-7b062ca565ee.png)

As the results are processed on-the-fly you still need to use the data from your database for a in-depth analysis of your stored information. Check the latest [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/home-assistant/home-assistant-notebooks/blob/master/database-statistics.ipynb) for doing statistics with your Home Assistant database.

### REST! We don't...

There was a lot of work done on our implementation which are working with RESTful APIs. [@w1ll1am23](https://github.com/w1ll1am23) extended the [aREST](https://arest.io/) platforms to display if an aREST unit is available or not. The aREST is now covered by the configuration check as well. Please check the Breaking changes section for more details.

The [REST sensor](https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.rest/) supports now HTTP authentication (basic and digest) and custom header. This will allow you to access resources which are protected. This sample sensor will access GitHub and retrieve the latest release number while by-passing the rate limit for non-authenticated requests.

``` yaml
sensor
  - platform: rest
    resource: https://api.github.com/repos/home-assistant/home-assistant/releases/latest
    username: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
    authentication: basic
    value_template: '{% raw %}{{ value_json.tag_name }}{% endraw %}'
    headers:
      Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json
      Content-Type: application/json
      User-Agent: Home Assistant REST sensor
```

### Misc
- GitHub released with a recent update a review feature. This will give you more control over your comments while you review an open Pull Request.  
- Thanks to [@robbiet480](https://github.com/robbiet480) we are now running [mention-bot](https://github.com/mention-bot). It will help you when you create a new Pull Request to identify potential reviewers.
- The [Home Assistant Community Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/) has now an additional section called ""Installation"".

### Breaking changes
- All deprecated condition options from `automation` have been removed (deprecated since May and have printed warnings to your console):
  - `use_trigger_values` is gone. You have to copy your triggers to conditions and adjust for the correct config.
  - `condition_type` is gone. Use `condition: or` instead.
  - To specify the type of a condition, use `condition:` instead of `platform:`. 
- The [Forecast.io](https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.forecast/) was renamed to [Dark Sky](https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.darksky/). Replace your `- platform: forecast` with `- platform: darksky`.
- The [aREST](https://arest.io/) configuration between the [sensor](https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.arest/) and the [switch](https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.arest/) platform was aligned.

4259702,2016-09-29T04:21:13Z,2016-09-29T04:22:10Z,0.29,"Last week, September 17 marked our 3 year anniversary. In this time Home Assistant managed to grow from a simple script that turned on my lights when the sun set to a kick ass open source project with the best community an open-source project could wish for. This release contains features, bug fixes and performance tweaks by a total of **50** different people! We have also managed to cross the 1000 forks on GitHub. Talking about momentum!

This is a big release as we've completely overhauled the internals of Home Assistant. When I initially wrote Home Assistant, still figuring out the ins and outs of Python, I went for an approach that I was familiar with for an application with many moving parts: threads and locks. This approach has served us well over the years but it was slower than it needed to be, especially on limited hardware.

This all changed when [@bbangert](https://github.com/bbangert) came around and took on the tough job to migrate the core over to use asynchronous programming. He did an amazing job and I am happy to say that the initial port has been done and is included in this release! On top of that, we have been able to keep our simple and straightforward API at the same time. We are still in the process of migrating more and more components over to the asynchronous API, so expect more speedups and awesome features in the upcoming releases.

### SleepIQ and OpenALPR

There now is support for two new super cool things: Beds and license plates. [@technicalpickles](https://github.com/technicalpickles) created a [SleepIQ](https://home-assistant.io/components/sleepiq/) component that let you monitor the sensor data of your bed. [@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli) has added license plate recognition based on [OpenALPR](https://home-assistant.io/components/openalpr/)! This means that you can now be notified about which car is parked on your driveway or in your garage. I also would like to use this opportunity to give a big shoutout to [@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli) for being such an awesome member of our community. He joined us at the end of June and has helped crush bugs and add awesome features ever since (65 pull requests already!).

### Configuration validation

On the voluptuous front we have also made great progress. We were able to fully remove the legacy config helpers and have migrated 323 of the 346 components and platforms that needed migrating! This does mean that for some components the configuration has slightly changed, make sure to check out the breaking changes section at the bottom for more info. Thanks everybody for reviewing the Pull requests, testing the changes, and reporting issues. 

### Delayed Release

As you might have noticed, this release has been delayed by 5 days. This was due to a rare, difficult to reproduce problem with the Python interpreter. A huuuuge thanks to all the people that have helped countless hours in researching, debugging and fixing this issue: @bbangert, @turbokongen, @lwis, @technicalpickles, @pvizeli, @persandstrom and @joyrider3774. I am grateful to have all of you as part of the Home Assistant community.

### Reload automation rules and groups

This release brings you a huge improvement of the [automation](/components/automation/) and [group](/components/group/) handling. Both can be reloaded without a Home Assistant restart. The automations can be controlled directly from the frontend.

![automation-switches](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/116184/18410736/7aca1032-7769-11e6-9f06-d15f12a0cec1.png)

### Raspberry Pi installation guide

Singleboard computers are very popular to run Home Assistant. To support this fact, the [installation documentation](/getting-started/installation-raspberry-pi/) for the Raspberry Pi devices was re-written to get users started as quickly as possible. [@Landrash](https://github.com/Landrash) took the lead with on this tasks with help from [@kellerza](https://github.com/kellerza) and [@MartinHjelmare](https://github.com/MartinHjelmare). 

### Climate and  cover

There are countless bugfixes included in this release which will make your experience with the `climate` and the `cover` platforms better. Two week ago was the biggest merger of implementations released that ever happened in the history of Home Assistant. Thanks to [@turbokongen](https://github.com/turbokongen), [@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli), [@djbanks](https://github.com/djbanks), [@danielperna84](https://github.com/danielperna84), and others the improvements on the code and the frontend side is continuing... 

### API documentation

The [Home Assistant API Documentation](https://dev-docs.home-assistant.io/en/dev/) is a great addition to the already exisiting user documentation. The focus is not end-users but developers who whant to get details about the code without actually browsing the code on Github.

### Templating

`data_template` needs to be present in all notify templates for the future.

``` yaml
action:
  service: notify.telegram
  data_template:
    message: ""Test from your Home""
    data:
      location:
        latitude: ""{{ state.device_tracker.phone.attributes.latitude }}""
        longitude: ""{{ state.device_tracker.phone.attributes.longitude }}""
```

Stay tuned for more details.

### Configuration validation

The validation of the configuration is still on-going. Approximatly 80 % is done. This means that we will propably talk about this topic in the next release notes again. To align the configuration of components and platforms we needed to break some. Please refer to the Breaking changes section to check if you need to update your configuration or simple check your log for configuration validation errors. Thanks to [@kellerza](https://github.com/kellerza), [@fabaff](https://github.com/fabaff), [@Teagan42](https://github.com/Teagan42), and [@pvizeli](https://github.com/pvizeli) for your effort!

### Breaking changes
- [OpenweatherMap](/components/sensor.openweathermap/) entity IDs are now like `sensor.owm_temperature`. Previously they were like `sensor.weather_temperature`. Apologies for this change, but we needed to make OpenWeatherMap more generic now that we have many weather platforms.
- Updates of configuration variables due to configuration check or alignment with other platforms. Please update your configuration entries according to the documentation:
  - [OctoPrint](/components/octoprint/) component
  - mFi platform ([switch](/components/switch.mfi/) and [sensor](/components/sensor.mfi/))
  - NX584 Alarm Control Panel
  - Mediaplayer platforms: [FireTV](/components/media_player.firetv/) and [MPD](/components/media_player.mpd/)
  - [switch](/components/switch.command_line/) and the [cover](/components/cover.command_line/) `command_line` platforms 
- Custom components extending `BaseNotificationService` need to be aware that `kwargs.get(ATTR_TITLE)` will now return `None` if a title has not been set, and will need to specify `kwargs.get(ATTR_TITLE, ATTR_TITLE_DEFAULT)` if they always require a title.

This week's blog post could only be possibly described by exactly one word:

# #Amazing

<sup>or <sup>maybe<sup>#supersized</sup></sup></sup>

Keep reading to see what **#Amazing** things we have in store for you this week :smile:! And make sure you read all the way to the end, because I left a present down there for those committed few among you :)

But first...

## Some general housekeeping

Paulus (@balloob) is on vacation in Europe this week, so you will all have to deal with me, Robbie (@robbiet480) for this release blog post. Don't worry, Paulus will be back to tearing apart your pull requests in no time :-). 

Special thanks to my awesome helpers for this week's release who are looking over my shoulder to make sure I'm crossing my t's and dotting my i's: @Teagan42, @infamy and @fabaff.

For my next trick, let's hand out some...

## Trophies

I felt that I had to 1-up Paulus (@balloob) somehow with his 500,000 pageviews stat he shared in the [0.26 blog post](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/08/13/foursquare-fast-com-ffmpeg-gpsd/), so I pushed myself and our development community as a whole super hard the last two weeks to put a lot of love into Home Assistant to bring you not just 1, but 6 **#Amazing** stats for this release. As of 0.27, we have now surpassed the following milestones:
- [10,000](https://travis-ci.org/home-assistant/home-assistant/builds/154660811) builds on Travis (congrats to @BluGeni)
- [3,000](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/3000) issues and pull requests (thanks @kellerza!)
- [2,000](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/2991) pull requests alone (awesome @fabaff!!)
- 900 forks on Github!

In addition,
- We are very close to 4,000 stars on Github!
- [I'm now #5 contributor by most commits!!!](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/graphs/contributors) Hey wait, how'd this get in here 😳 

Now that we have that great news out of the way, onto this week's release which is going to keep the **#Amazing** gravy train rolling right along and get to the stuff you all _really_ are here for.

## 0.27

While this release is **#Amazing**, we had to break a few eggs (now you understand the title reference!) to make a beautiful omelette (using home automation obviously) so some platforms and components have needed to introduce breaking changes. Please make sure to read the Breaking Changes section below.

#### [Hue Bridge Emulation](https://home-assistant.io/components/emulated_hue/)

Thanks to @mgbowen we now have the functionality previously provided by @blocke's [ha-local-echo](https://github.com/blocke/ha-local-echo) built right into Home Assistant! This means that for those of you with devices that either lack or have a subpar integration with Home Assistant (looking at you Amazon Echo) you can now have a better experience by having your Home Assistant pretend to be a Hue Bridge. Personally, I have used @auchter's [Haaska](https://github.com/auchter/haaska) previously but found that it was slow to respond and sometimes failed entirely. With the new [`emulated_hue`](https://home-assistant.io/components/emulated_hue/) component, you can have local control of entities through Amazon Echo.

#### Notification improvements

We have some excellent upgrades to the notification system coming to you in 0.27, courtesy of me, @robbiet480.

##### [HTML5 Push Notifications](https://home-assistant.io/components/notify.html5/)

This release adds support for HTML5 push notifications on Chrome/Firefox/Opera on both desktop and Android devices. This means that you can send a notification to your phone even your Home Assistant is not in your mobile browser. When using Chrome you can even include 2 action buttons so that you can control your Home Assistant from your phone's lock screen, allowing you to do things like sound alarms or unlock your front door, all without leaving the notification. Thanks again to me (@robbiet480) and Paulus (@balloob) for all the hard work on this!

![screenshot_20160816-225335](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1444314/17917008/3a58dab0-696d-11e6-9c40-4f47c727e142.png)

##### [Notification Groups](https://home-assistant.io/components/notify.group/)

Using the new notify `group` platform allows you to cut down a lot of duplicate automation logic by combining multiple notification platforms and `target`s into a single notify service. Check out the [docs](https://home-assistant.io/components/notify.group/) for more info.

##### `target` is no longer needed

For platforms that support it, starting with the new HTML5 platform, any `target`s that are available will be exposed as individual services, so no more having to remember which `target`s to use. Please note that the existing services also still exist so you can keep using `target` if you wish.

#### Validate config before a restart

Ever restarted Home Assistant to test a config change just to find out there is a validation error? Well, not anymore! @kellerza has added a command line script that will validate your configuration as if you started Home Assistant.

``` bash
$ hass --script check_config
```

#### Config validation

This release includes a big push on making sure all platforms contain proper configuration validation. This should help in getting your configuration right. Thanks to @fabaff, @pavoni, @pvizeli, @nkgilley for all the hard work on this, you all rock!

![screen shot 2016-08-23 at 8 20 41 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1444314/17917210/22ede3aa-696f-11e6-84f0-f7a7653cd695.png)

#### [FFMPEG motion / noise sensing](https://home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor.ffmpeg/)

It's now possible to use FFMPEG to monitor a video stream and detect motion thanks to a new binary sensor platform by @pvizeli.

#### Component clean up - `thermostat` & `hvac` -> `climate`. `rollershutter` & `garage_door` -> `cover`

Due to our wild growth we ended up with a few components that had a lot of overlapping functionality. @turbokongen took on the hard job on merging them. Thermostat and HVAC platforms are now combined under the new Climate component. Rollershutter and Garage Door platforms are now combined under the new Cover component. You can easily upgrade by just swapping out the name. For example replace `thermostat` with `climate`. The old components have been deprecated and will be removed in the near future.

#### A new `fan` component

Along with the new `climate` component, @Teagan42 and I (@robbiet480) decided we needed something simpler to just control a fan. Currently it has support for controlling Insteon fans. MQTT support will appear in 0.28.0. I tried to get it implemented before 0.27.0 but spent too long writing this blog post 😢.

#### Breaking changes
- Ecobee3 occupancy sensors have moved from sensor platform to binary sensor platform.
- Forecast.io entity IDs are now like `sensor.forecastio_temperature`. Previously they were like `sensor.weather_temperature`. Apologies for this change, but we needed to make Forecast.io more generic now that we have many weather platforms.
- The loopenergy sensor configuration format changed slightly, please reformat based on the revised documentation.
- The configuration for the Sabnzbd sensor has slightly changed. The prefix `type:` is no longer required for monitored variables.

#### Deprecations
- Using the `thermostat` and `hvac` components has been deprecated. Please migrate to the new `climate` component. (just change the component name, the configurations are compatible)
- Using the `rollershutter` and `garage_door` components have also been deprecated. Please migrate to the new `cover` component. (just change the component name, the configurations are compatible)

## Finishing up

Thanks all for sticking with me to the end. I'll be taking over a lot of Paulus's (@balloob) work while he is gone, but as I said, don't worry because he'll be back well before 0.28 comes out. Hopefully you didn't find this jovial blog post too jarring from our standard style, I just wrote a lot of this at 2am after being awake for almost 20 hours, so I'm a little loopy hahaha 😴.

Also, thanks as always to our developer contributors, documentation contributors, but most of all our users! This would've just been a script that Paulus (@balloob) used to control his lights at home if we didn't have your enthusiasm.

Feel free to let me know what you thought of this blog post and release on Gitter or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robbie), or even the [Home Assistant Twitter](https://twitter.com/home_assistant). Did I mention we have a brand new [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/homeassistantio) that you should absolutely Like? There's a convenient Facebook Like and Twitter follow button right over there -->.

I almost forgot about your 🎁 for reading all the way to here: a :cookie:! Hope you enjoy it in good health :smile:.

Talk to you soon on Gitter and in your pull request comments!

First I want to highlight that we are now having 500 000 monthly pageviews on the website. A big milestone for us! It's been an amazing journey. Big thanks to the Home Assistant community for being such a delightful bunch.

This release includes code contributed by 31 different people. The biggest change in this release is a new unit system. Instead of picking Celsius or Fahrenheit you'll have to pick imperial or metric now. This influences the units for your temperature, distance, weight. This will simplify any platform or component that needs to know this information. Big thanks to @Teagan42 for her hard work on this!

### Breaking changes
- A new unit system has superseded the temperature unit option in the core config. For now it is backwards compatible, but you should update soon:

``` yaml
# Configuration.yaml example
homeassistant:
  # 'metric' for Metric System, 'imperial' for imperial system
  unit_system: metric
```

It's time for 0.24 and it contains some structural changes to our history which requires action from your end, so please keep reading.

Roy Hooper did an amazing job migrating the history support from being tied to SQLite to use the ORM SQLAlchemy instead. This means that you can now use **any** SQL backend for the history. So besides SQLite you can now databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

However, this does require that you run a command to migrate your existing history over. We tried to make the process as seamless as possible by introducing a new command line script: 

``` bash
hass --script db_migrator --config /path/to/config
```

You can omit the `--config` option if you use the default configuration directory. Run the script with `--help` to get more options.

Wink support has been dramatically improved by migrating to the PubNub API. This allows Wink to push changes from their system to Home Assistant.

On the config side, you can now store your passwords in your OS keyring or just in a standalone file. We also got a new service to reload the core config so no reboots needed anymore after changing customize settings!

**Scripts** are now available in automations and when responding to Alexa/Amazon Echo. Both of these components will now expose data to be used in script templates (including `from_state` !). Passing data to script entities is available by passing the data to the script services.

``` yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: mqtt
    topic: some/notify/topic
  action:
    service: notify.notify
    data_template:
      message: {{ trigger.payload }}

automation 2:
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: light.hue
  action:
    service: notify.notify
    data_template:
      message: {{ trigger.to_state.name }} is now {{ trigger.to_state.state }}
```

**Entity Namespaces** allow you to influence the entity ids for a specific platform. For example you can turn `light.living_room` into `light.holiday_home_living_room` with the following config:

``` yaml
light:
  platform: hue
  entity_namespace: holiday_home
```

### Deprecations
- Conditions in automations should now specify which condition to use with `condition:` instead of `platform:`. For example `condition: state`.
- RFXtrx has a new config format. 

Old RFXtrx config format:

```
  devices:
    123efab1:
      name: My DI.0 light device
      packetid: 1b2200000890efab1213f60

It's time for 0.18. This release cycle is 2 days shorter than usual as I'll be travelling to Europe. This also means that it can take some more time before you get feedback on PRs in the next 2 weeks.

Since the last release we have moved all Home Assistant source code etc into it's own [organisation on GitHub](https://github.com/home-assistant). We're growing up! This sadly did cause us to have to move all Docker images. Check the breaking changes section for more info.

### Breaking changes
- The location of the Docker image has changed. There was no possibility for us to keep maintaining the old image (as it was bound to the GitHub repo under my name) or to make a redirect. So if you are using the Home Assistant Docker image,  change it to run `homeassistant/home-assistant:latest` for the latest release and `homeassistant/home-assistant:dev` for the latest dev version.
- We have migrated our datetime format to be iso8601. This will only impact you if you are consuming the date times from the API directly. You can ignore this if you are just using Home Assistant via configuration and the frontend.
- The constant `TEMP_CELCIUS` is now correctly called `TEMP_CELSIUS`. Old one is deprecated and will eventually be removed.
- MySensors received two big changes that will cause you to update your configs.
  1. All MySensors entity IDs are different! There was an error in the naming that caused MySensors to append node ID and child ID instead of separating them with an underscore. This has been fixed but will cause all your MySensors entity IDs to change. This is a one time breaking change.
  2. The second change is that we now support the TCP ethernet gateway. This is causing a slight change to the config format: you have to change `port:` under `gateways` to `device:`. See below for new example config.

``` yaml
mysensors:
  gateways:
    - device: '/dev/ttyUSB0'
      persistence_file: 'path/mysensors.json'
      baud_rate: 38400
    - device: '/dev/ttyACM0'
      persistence_file: 'path/mysensors2.json'
      baud_rate: 115200
    - device: '192.168.1.18'
      persistence_file: 'path/mysensors3.json'
      tcp_port: 5003
  debug: true
  persistence: true

So to help catch those pesky errors that sneak into your files we've been hard at work to introduce config validation! Especially huge thanks to @jaharkes for his hard work on this. Config validation is still in it's early stages. More common platforms and components have been added but we didn't do everything yet.

When we encounter an invalid config we will now write a warning to your logs. You can see those in the frontend by clicking on the last developer tool. We're looking into options to make it more clear - it is a work in progress.

Another big thing is the addition of GTFS support. You probably don't know it, but GTFS is the standard that public transit companies all over the world use to distribute their schedule. This means that you can now have the time of the next bus/train/etc right in your frontend.

### Breaking changes

As of now we are not aware of any breaking changes. However, it might be that Home Assistant will not start for you because of an invalid configuration. A common mistake that people are making is that they are still referring to `execute_service` in their script configs. This should be `service`.

I would like to give a big shoutout to @philipbl who put a lot in effort in helping the migration to move towards using templates for a wide variety of platforms.

- Device tracker: iCloud platform added (@xorso, @kevinpanaro)
- Frontend: Improved caching using service workers if served over SSL (@balloob)
- Sensor: Twitch platform added (@happyleavesaoc)

- Sensor: ELIQ Online platform added (@molobrakos)
- Binary sensor: REST platform added (@fabaff)
- Sensor: Torque (OBD2) platform added (@happyleavesaoc)

### Templates

This release introduces templates. This will allow you to parse data before it gets processed or create messages for notifications on the fly based on data within Home Assistant. Templates can be specified using Jinja2 templates ([docs](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/)) with some Home Assistant specific additions:
- Iterating `states` will yield each state sorted alphabetically by entity id
- Iterating `states.domain` will yield each state of that domain sorted alphabetically by entity id
- `states.sensor.temperature` returns state object for `sensor.temperature`
- `states('device_tracker.paulus')` will return the state of given entity or `unknown` if it doesn't exist.
- `is_state('device_tracker.paulus', 'home')` will test if given entity is specified state.

There are also two extra filters: `multiply` and `round`. Both which convert strings to numbers before doing their job.

Example templates and what they could result in:

| Template | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `{{ states('device_tracker.paulus') }}` | home |
| `{{ states.device_tracker.paulus.attributes.battery }}` | 34 |
| `{% for state in states.sensor %}{{ state.entity_id }}={{ state.state }}, {% endfor %}` | senor.thermostat=24, sensor.humidity=40, |
| `{{ value['hello'][0] | multiply(10) | round(1) }}` | 10.2 |

``` jinja2
{% if is_state('device_tracker.paulus', 'home') %}
  Ha, Paulus is home!
{% else %}
  Paulus is at {{ states('device_tracker.paulus')) }}.
{% endif %}
```

The notification component and the new Alexa/Amazon Echo component are both using the new template functionality to render responses.

A template editor has been added to the developer tool section in the app so you can get instant feedback if your templates are working or not.

### Breaking changes

Templates will now be the only way to extract data from 'raw' sources like REST, CommandSensor or MQTT. This will replace any specific option that used to do this before. This means that `precision`, `factor`, `attribute` or `json_path` etc will no longer work.

Affected components and platforms:
- sensor: arest
- sensor: command_sensor
- sensor: rest
- sensor: MQTT
- switch: MQTT
- rollershutter: MQTT
- light: MQTT
- binary_sensor: MQTT
- automation: numeric_state

The script component would use the alias as the key for the script instead of the key in the configuration.

  hello:
    alias: Hello World
    sequence:

```

This configuration used to result in a service called `script.hello`. In 0.7.6 it accidentally became `script.hello_world`. This PR makes it `script.hello` again.

Also fixes another regression where the aRest component expecting a pins config key, even if no pins are wanted to be observed.

### Breaking changes

Yep, sadly we had to break some stuff to improve our robustness. Each piece of code should do 1 thing and 1 thing well, this was not the case.

**Heat Control thermostat no longer includes any scheduling.**
This feature has been removed completely. Use the `automation` component instead to control target temperature.

**Config changed for calling a service from a script.**
The new way of doing it is to specify `service:` where you used to specify `execute_service:`. The old method will continue working for some time.

**Scenes can no longer be turned off.**
It is no longer possible to turn a scene off after it has been activated. This was only possible if activated manually and no other changes to target entities was made afterwards. Most devices had small changes in their reported state over time which would disable the turning off option. This caused a lot of confusion so it was decided to remove it.

**Downloader treats relative paths now based on config dir instead of current working dir.**
This makes more sense as most people run Home Assistant as a daemon

#### Migration notes

The `scheduler` component has been removed in this release as all functionality has been ported over to the `automation` component.

The `automation` component configuration format has changed. The old one is still supported but you are encouraged to use the new format. Examples of new format:

``` yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: some_cool_event
    - platform: state
      entity_id: some.entity
      from: happy
      to: excited
    - platform: sun
      event: sunset
      offset: -00:45:00
  condition_type: OR
  condition:
    - platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.lux
      above: 200
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.lux
      to: 500
  action:
    execute_service: 'light.turn_off'
    service_entity_id: 'light.kitchen'
```

``` yaml
automation:
  trigger:
   - platform: state
     entity_id:  sensor.lux
     below: 200

   - platform: time
     after: '07:00'

   - platform: state
     entity_id: media_player.livingroom
     from: 'on'
     state: 'off'

  condition: use_trigger_values

  action:
    execute_service: 'light.turn_on'

Thanks to the hard work by @rmkraus, Home Assistant will now be able to be distributed via PyPi. By default, Home Assistant will be installed with no support for specific platforms. This will be installed on the fly when the user enables platforms.

To install this version of Home Assistant:

``` bash
python3 -m pip install homeassistant
```

To upgrade to a new version in the future:

``` bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade homeassistant
```

### Package management

Before this release Home Assistant would use a virtual environment to make sure we would not install global packages. That didn't work out well for everyone :disappointed:. The new approach we take is to install all packages in a `lib` folder inside your config folder.

### Command-line

When you install Home Assistant via PyPi, a new command line utility will be added called `hass`. You can call this to launch Home Asssistant from any folder. The new default configuration folder is `~/.homeassistant` (in `%APPDATA%` for Windows users). As before, if you want to specify a new configuration folder, use the `--config /path/to/folder` command-line argument.

### Migrating to version 0.7

Home Assistant will be installed as a command line utility starting this release. This means that it is no longer necessary to do a git checkout to get up and running.

For this example, let's say we have an old Home Assistant installation in `/home/paulus/home-assistant`.

If you want to migrate your existing configuration to be used as the default configuration:

``` bash
cp -r /home/paulus/home-assistant ~/.homeassistant
```

It If you want to have the configuration in a different location, for example `/home/paulus/home-assistant-config`, you will have to point Home Assistant at this configuration folder when launching:

``` bash
hass --config /home/paulus/home-assistant-config
```
