Also, I found a major bug affecting Little Big Planet among others, fixing that as well. The UI now also has multi-language support, it's in Settings->System. All these fixes are enough to motivate a new official release, so here we go - 0.7.6! It may take a few hours before it's visible on Google Play.

Another month, another version of PPSSPP! This time I've only added 0.0.5 to the version number, but that's just because I'm saving 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0 for big future updates :) Don't worry, there's been plenty of improvements. Many more games run and some games run faster - the God of War games should now run well on modest PCs and for example the Monster Hunter games are becoming playable on fast phones (although without sound). And I've started to improve the UI - now there's a recent list and game icons in the game selector.

Anyway, stop reading and try it out! And don't forget to buy the Gold version if you use Android and want to support further development.

PPSSPP has once again improved by leaps and bounds, thanks to plenty of hard work from everyone involved! Compatibility has gone up dramatically, speed has increased drastically (especially on mobile) and everything is just better. There's even horizontal tilt control! Some newly playable games are God of War (very slow though, but this will probably be fixed in the near future), Virtua Tennis, Megaman: Maverick Hunter X, Saint Seiya and games like Ace Combat X go in game. Enjoy!

Yeah, so I found the bug. Turns out that LDR r0, [r0] should be encoded as 0xE5900000, not 0xE4900000. If you don't know what that means, well, I can just tell you that the problem was very hard to find but very easy to fix once I found it.

Alright, it's been a while so here's 0.6. It has a preliminary ARM JIT which greatly boosts speed on Android and other ARM platforms, and vertex caching which likewise improves performance quite a bit. Unfortunately I still haven't been able to fix a bug that causes the JIT not to work correctly on Snapdragon CPUs, instead it just crashes. I will fix this issue in an upcoming 0.61 release, stay tuned!

Also, a bunch of new games work but a couple have stopped working (like Mortal Kombat). These will be back, don't worry - it's what happens when emulators develop, sometimes when you fix things, things that worked ""by accident"" before breaks until you fix another thing.

The last release was over a month ago, but believe me, it's been worth the wait! PPSSPP 0.5 brings large compatibility improvements, much better audio, many graphics fixes, savegames working in many games, and save states too! All of this available for both Android and Windows, with more ports coming soon.

In this release we also make available the PPSSPP Gold version, which is a paid version with a golden icon but otherwise identical to the main release. If you want to support the development of PPSSPP, a great way is to buy PPSSPP Gold. Currently only available for Android.

Now, stay tuned for v0.6, for which I have planned to write a dynarec (JIT) for ARM, which will improve speed on Android.
