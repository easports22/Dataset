8000736,2017-10-03T18:14:05Z,2017-10-04T20:55:50Z,," Use http4s-dsl with any effect type by either:
    * extend `Http4sDsl[F]`
    * create an object that extends `Http4sDsl[F]`, and extend that.
    * `import org.http4s.dsl.io._` is still available for those who
      wish to specialize on `cats.effect.IO`
* Remove `Semigroup[F[MaybeResponse[F]]]` constraint from
  `BlazeBuilder`.
* Fix `AutoSlash` middleware when a service is mounted with a prefix.
* Publish internal http4s-parboiled2 as a separate module.  This does
  not add any new third-party dependencies, but unbreaks `sbt
  publishLocal`.
* Add `Request.from`, which respects `X-Fowarded-For` header.
* Make `F` in `EffectMessageSyntax` invariant
* Add `message.decodeJson[A]` syntax to replace awkward `message.as(implicitly,
  jsonOf[A])`. Brought into scope by importing one of the following, based on
  your JSON library of choice.
  * `import org.http4s.argonaut._`
  * `import org.http4s.circe._`
  * `import org.http4s.json4s.jackson._`
  * `import org.http4s.json4s.native._`
* `AsyncHttpClient.apply` no longer takes a `bufferSize`.  It is made
  irrelevant by fs2-reactive-streams.
* `MultipartParser.parse` no longer takes a `headerLimit`, which was unused.
* Add `maxWaitQueueLimit` (default 256) and `maxConnectionsPerRequestKey`
  (default 10) to `PooledHttp1Client`.
* Remove private implicit `ExecutionContext` from `StreamApp`. This had been
  known to cause diverging implicit resolution that was hard to debug.
* Shift execution of the routing of the `HttpService` to the `ExecutionContext`
  provided by the `JettyBuilder` or `TomcatBuilder`. Previously, it only shifted
  the response task and stream. This was a regression from v0.16.
* Add two utility execution contexts. These may be used to increase throughput
  as the server builder's `ExecutionContext`. Blocking calls on routing may
  decrease fairness or even deadlock your service, so use at your own risk:
  * `org.http4s.util.execution.direct`
  * `org.http4s.util.execution.trampoline`
* Deprecate `EffectRequestSyntax` and `EffectResponseSyntax`. These were
  previously used to provide methods such as `.putHeaders` and `.withBody`
  on types `F[Request]` and `F[Response]`.  As an alternative:
  * Call `.map` or `.flatMap` on `F[Request]` and `F[Response]` to get access
    to all the same methods.
  * Variadic headers have been added to all the status code generators in
    `Http4sDsl[F]` and method generators in `import org.http4s.client._`.
    For example:
    * `POST(uri, urlForm, Header(""Authorization"", ""Bearer s3cr3t""))`
    * ``Ok(""This will have an html content type!"", `Content-Type`(`text/html`))``
* Restate `HttpService[F]` as a `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], Request[F], Response[F]]`.
* Similarly, `AuthedService[F]` as a `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], AuthedRequest[F], Response[F]]`.
* `MaybeResponse` is removed, because the optionality is now expressed through
  the `OptionT` in `HttpService`. Instead of composing `HttpService` via a
  `Semigroup`, compose via a `SemigroupK`. Import `org.http4s.implicits._` to
  get a `SemigroupK[HttpService]`, and chain services as `s1 <+> s2`. We hope to
  remove the need for `org.http4s.implicits._` in a future version of cats with
  [issue 1428](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/1428).
* The `Service` type alias is deprecated in favor of `Kleisli`.  It used to represent
  a partial application of the first type parameter, but since version 0.18, it is
  identical to `Kleisli.
* `HttpService.lift`, `AuthedService.lift` are deprecated in favor of `Kleisli.apply`.
* Remove `java.xml.bind` dependency from `GZip` middleware to avoid an
  extra module dependency in Java 9.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * jawn-fs2-0.12.0-M2
    * log4s-1.4.0

* Added support for Zipkin headers
* Eliminate response attribute for detecting fallthrough response.
  The fallthrough response must be `Response.fallthrough`.
* Encode URI path segments created with `/`
* Introduce `AuthedRequest` and `AuthedService` types.
* Replace `CharSequenceEncoder` with `CharBufferEncoder`, assuming
  that `CharBuffer` and `String` are the only `CharSequence`s one
  would want to encode.
* Remove `EnittyEncoder[Char]` and `EntityEncoder[Byte]`.  Send an
  array, buffer, or String if you want this.
* Add `DefaultHead` middleware for `HEAD` implementation.
* Decouple `http4s-server` from Dropwizard Metrics.  Metrics code is
  in the new `http4s-metrics` module.
* Allow custom scheduler for timeout middleware.
* Add parametric empty `EntityEncoder` and `EntityEncoder[Unit]`.
* Replace unlawful `Order[CharsetRange]` with `Equal[CharsetRange]`.
* Auth middlewares renamed `BasicAuth` and `DigestAuth`.
* `BasicAuth` passes client password to store instead of requesting
  password from store.
* Remove realm as an argument to the basic and digest auth stores.
* Basic and digest auth stores return a parameterized type instead of
  just a String username.
