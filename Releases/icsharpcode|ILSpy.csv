Language support status can be found in [issue #829](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/issues/829), please note that this is a live issue and might have changed after this preview has been published. Notable missing feature compared to older versions: nullables. (only fully implemented features have a checkmark in the status issue). Before opening an issue (""X doesn't decompile correctly"") please go check with [issue #829](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/issues/829)!

New: support for .NET Standard and .NET Core assemblies.

Missing: decompile to VB. Contributions welcome because we concentrate solely on C#.

Architectural changes are documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/wiki/newdecompiler) (Note: roadmap not up to date as of this release).
