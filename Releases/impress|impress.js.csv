- 2da949e: Version 0.5 introduced events including `impress:stepenter`, but this event was not triggered properly in some specific transition types (for example when only scale was changing between steps). It was caused by the fact that in such cases expected `transitionend` event was not triggered. Unfortunately modern `transitionend` event is no longer used to detect when the transition has finished, but old school (and more reliable) `setTimeout` is used.

- 8220ab9...e06cda1 b3d680e: API changed, so that `impress()` function no longer automatically initialize presentation; new method called `init` was added to API and it should be used to start the presentation. `impress:init` event is triggered on root presentation element (`#impress` by default) when presentation is initialized
- c64d9fb: new CSS classes were added: `impress-disabled` is added to `body` element by the impress.js script and it's changed to `impress-enabled` when `init()` function is called
- 1bbf205 b3d680e: Events added when step is entered and left - custom `impress:stepenter` and `impress:stepleave` events are triggered on step elements and can be handled like any other DOM events (with `addEventListener`)
- b0a139e...5fd0f58: Additional past, present and future classes are added to step elements
- 1a21865: `goto()` API method is back! it seems that goto **was** a future reserved word but isn't anymore, so we can use this short and pretty name instead of camelCassy `stepTo` - and yes, that means API changed again...
- 9d99c03: additionally `goto()` method now supports new types of parameters
- b0c5644: `goto()` also accepts second parameter to define the transition duration in ms, for example `impress().goto(""make-it-quick"", 300)` or `impress().goto(""now"", 0)`

#### UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS

In current version calling `impress()` doesn't automatically initialize the presentation. You need to call `init()` function from the API. So in a place were you called `impress()` to initialize impress.js simply change this call to `impress().init()`.

Version 0.4 changed `goto` API method into `stepTo`. It turned out that `goto` is not a reserved word anymore, so it can be used in JavaScript. That's why version 0.5 brings it back and removes `stepTo`.

So if you have been using version 0.4 and have any reference to `stepTo` API method make sure to change it to `goto`.

#### UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS

If in your custom JavaScript code you were using `goto()` function from impress.js API make sure to change it
to `stepTo()`.

If in your CSS you were using classes based on currently active step with `step-` prefix, such as `step-bored`
(where `bored` is the id of the step element) make sure to change it to `impress-on-` prefix
(for example `impress-on-bored`). Also in previous versions these classes were assigned to `#impress` element
and now they are added to `body` element, so if your CSS code depends on this, it also should be updated.

Same happened to `impress-not-supported` class name - it was moved from `#impress` element to `body`, so update
your CSS if it's needed.

#### NOTE ON BLACKBERRY PLAYBOOK

Changes and fixes added in this version have broken the experience on Blackberry Playbook with OS in version 1.0.
It happened due to a bug in the Playbook browser in this version. Fortunately in version 2.0 of Playbook OS this
bug was fixed and impress.js works fine.

So currently, on Blackberry Playbook, impress.js work only with latest OS. Fortunately, [it seems that most of the
users](http://twitter.com/n_adam_stanley/status/178188611827679233) [are quite quick with updating their devices](http://twitter.com/brcewane/status/178230406196379648)

**Breaking Changes**

Because API was introduced the way impress.js script is initialized was changed a bit. You not only have to include [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js/blob/36816e3b4288962a452dcc5a4f59df6b0e5257ef/js/impress.js) script file, but also call `impress()` function.
