This is the fourth build of v5. Currently, only the videos and schedule section are implemented.

What changed since the last alpha version:
- PiP improvements and bug fixes
- Labs now show a special lab thumbnail with the track color as the background
- Live sessions now show a special live session thumbnail
- The app now prevents itself from running simultaneously with a previous version of the app, which would cause migration problems
- When changing selection/tabs while playing a video, the video that's currently playing will automatically enter PiP mode and exiting PiP mode will move the interface back to where it was when PiP was activated. This fixes the issue where you wouldn't be able to play another session after starting playing one
- The app will now save its state, preserving the active tab and selected sessions on each tab between launches
- The volume slider is now properly styled
- The volume button changes when muted
- When the player was previously muted, unmuting it restores the previous volume level

What's missing:
- Search
- Bookmarks
- Syncing user data between multiple computers
- Download status other than simple progress
- Other tabs (news and bookmarks)
- Transcripts
- Icon

Known issues:
- After a failed migration attempt, there's no way to try the migration again, this will be fixed with a button in preferences later
- The first time the app is opened, it can take a while before the data appears and there is no progress information
