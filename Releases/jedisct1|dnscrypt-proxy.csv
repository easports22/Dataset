- Support for TCP was added to the `hostip` tool.
- New plugin: `example-ldns-forwarding`. This plugin forwards queries for a specific set of domain names to one or more non-DNSCrypt resolvers. This can be used to send queries for private domains to the router or to an internal DNS server.
- New plugin: `example-cache`. This plugin implements a simple, zero-configuration DNS response cache.
- The default plugin paths, as loaded via the configuration file, use the native module file names instead of libtool's `.la` files. Installing the `.la` files has now become optional.
- Many changes and simplifications were made to the documentation.
- `-Z` (syslog prefix) doesn't imply `-S` any more.
- The `ResolverAddress` option can now be used even if a full configuration was provided via `ResolverName` in order to override the resolver IP and port.
- A new `contrib` folder is born, and currently contains a Python script to automatically generate a malware/spam/ads/tracker blacklist from public lists. More contributions would be more than welcome!
- Example startup scripts now use the configuration file.
- A `SIGHUP` signal sent to the proxy now reloads all the plugins.
  This can be used after a plugin configuration update, or to rotate the log files.
- `--ignore-timestamps` didn't work as expected. This has been fixed, thanks to Toni Uhlig.
- `make install` does not overwrite an existing `dnscrypt-proxy.conf` file any more. An up-to-date example is installed as `dnscrypt-proxy.conf.example`.
- The query log and the logfile of hits for blacklisted domains/IPs are now more detailed and more readable. As an alternative to human-readable records, prefixing a log file name with ""ltsv:"" causes the log entries to use the LTSV structured format. These logs can thus be easily sent to Flowgger/ElasticSearch for visualization and reporting.
- The domain/ip blocking plugin was completely rewritten, and is now extremely fast even with very lasrge blacklists of names and IP addresses. It can now be used to locally block malware/spam/ads/trackers and other unwanted content, based on prefixes, suffixes and keywords.
