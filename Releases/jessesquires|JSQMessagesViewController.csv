## Enhancements :sparkles:

:tada: **New `JSQAudioMediaItem` for sending audio media (#1495)**
Now you can embed audio files just as easily as images. Plays all formats supported by AVAudioPlayer (AAC, MP3, PCM, etc). Use the default UI or customize it via `JSQAudioMediaViewAttributes`. See the docs for details.
Thanks @eliburke!

:tada: **Fixed crash when long pressing on data detector links (#1247)**
This is a workaround for an iOS bug. 
Thanks @steipete!

:tada: **Improved custom cell menu support (#1281)**
Your `JSQMessagesViewController` subclass can now override `didReceiveMenuWillShowNotification:` and `didReceiveMenuWillHideNotification:` for more fine-grained `UIMenuController` handling.
Thanks @keyeMyria!

:tada: **Accessibility enhancements to improve VoiceOver support (#873)**
Cell and Accessory buttons now have accessibility labels. Incoming messages are announced.
Thanks @BillCarsonFr!

:tada: **Customizable `isOutgoing` method(#1203)**
Allows better control over incoming/outgoing directionality for Team/Group chats. See the docs for details.
Thanks @sebastianludwig!

``` objc
- (BOOL)isOutgoingMessage:(id<JSQMessageData>)messageItem;
```

:tada: **Scroll to a specific row in the collection, optionally animated (#1195)**
See the docs for details. Thanks @sebastianludwig!

``` objc
- (void)scrollToIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath animated:(BOOL)animated;
```

:tada: **New localizations**
- Malaysian (#1528)
- Indonesian (#1527)
- Norwegian (#1564)
- Finnish (#1415)

## Enhancements :sparkles:

:tada: **New solution for custom fonts (#347)** 
Using a custom font has been problematic for awhile. This mostly because there are tons of edge-cases regarding how glyph sizes are computed. To address this, the `JSQMessagesCollectionViewFlowLayout` object has a new property: 

``` objective-c
@property (strong, nonatomic) id<JSQMessagesBubbleSizeCalculating> bubbleSizeCalculator;
```

With this, you can now provide your own object conforming to the `JSQMessagesBubbleSizeCalculating` protocol and calculate the bubble sizes you need for your custom font! :sunglasses: The library provides a default value for this, an instance of `JSQMessagesBubblesSizeCalculator`, which maintains existing behavior.

:tada: **Fixed-width bubbles (#1112)** â€” Thanks @walsh2000!
See the docs for the aforementioned `JSQMessagesBubblesSizeCalculator`. Using fixed-width bubbles will prevent message bubbles from resizing on rotation to landscape.

:tada: **Text cells can now be deleted (#970)**
Opt-in to this behavior using the following:

``` objective-c
// in viewDidLoad
[JSQMessagesCollectionViewCell registerMenuAction:@selector(delete:)];

// then override the method
 - (void)collectionView:(JSQMessagesCollectionView *)collectionView didDeleteMessageAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
```

:tada: **Localizations for Korean (#1149) and Arabic (#1130)** 
Thanks @chanil1218 and @qaysdwekat!

:tada: **Better pin image drawing in `JSQLocationMediaItem` (#1162)**
Pins on location item maps are now perfectly centered. :sunglasses: 
Thanks @harlanhaskins!

:tada: **Intercept paste events from the input textView (#1136)**
See the docs for `JSQMessagesComposerTextViewPasteDelegate`.
Thanks @harlanhaskins!

:tada: **Spacing for input toolbar items (#1035)**
The `JSQMessagesToolbarContentView` class has gained 2 new properties: `leftContentPadding` and `rightContentPadding`. See the docs for details.
Thanks @kohtenko!

## What's new

The `- (NSUInteger)hash` method is **now required** for the `JSQMessageData` and `JSQMessageMediaData` protocols. The library has always implemented this for the provided model objects, but you must implement this method if you use custom classes/subclasses for your model objects. This is due to the new caching mechanism introduced in v6.0. See #631 for more details. (Note: you get `hash` from `NSObject`, but you should implement it yourself based on your message data.)

## Documentation

You can find the latest documentation [here](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/JSQMessagesViewController).

Also see the [Getting Started](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController#getting-started) guide in the README.

The demo project as also been updated, please use this as a guide.

## What's new

**Media Messages!** :tada: 
By far, this has been the most-requested feature for this library. The `JSQMessage` class has been updated to support media messages. This comes in the form of updates to the `JSQMessageData` protocol and the addition of a new protocol, `JSQMessageMediaData`. Additionally, there are 3 built-in media types: photo, video, and location. These are represented by the following 3 classes: `JSQPhotoMediaItem`, `JSQVideoMediaItem`, `JSQLocationMediaItem`. See the corresponding docs for more details.

Further, the library supports asynchronous loading of media. You can use `JSQMessagesMediaPlaceholderView` to display media items that are ""loading"". 

Also see the `JSQMessagesMediaViewBubbleImageMasker` for masking custom media item views as bubble images. The built-in media types have an `appliesMediaViewMaskAsOutgoing` property to specify if the media view is incoming or outgoing.

> **NOTE:** The media message model is extremely and easily extensible. You can easily provide your own custom media items by simply conforming to the `JSQMessageMediaData` protocol. For instance, you could create a new model object, `MyContactMediaItem`, that represents a contact (name, phone, address, email, etc.). All you need to do is conform to `JSQMessageMediaData` and pass this object to a `JSQMessage` object during initialization. The library will do the rest.

**A Refined Model**
The `JSQMessageData` protocol has been updated to include a `senderId` and `senderDisplayName`. (This was previously only `sender`.)

All model objects have been refined and updated, they are:
- `JSQMessage <JSQMessageData>` : represents message objects
- `JSQMediaItem <JSQMessageMediaData>` : base class for media objects
- `JSQPhotoMediaItem  <JSQMessageMediaData>` : represents photo attachments
- `JSQLocationMediaItem  <JSQMessageMediaData>` : represents location attachments
- `JSQVideoMediaItem  <JSQMessageMediaData>` : represents video attachments
- `JSQMessagesAvatarImage <JSQMessageAvatarImageDataSource>` : represents avatars
- `JSQMessagesBubbleImage <JSQMessageBubbleImageDataSource>` : represents message bubbles

> **NOTE:** Each of the built-in model classes simply conforms to a specific protocol in the library. This means **you can use your existing model objects** as long as they conform to the necessary protocols.

**JSQMessageBubbleImageDataSource Protocol**
This new data source protocol replaces the use of `imageView` objects for message bubble image views. The `messageBubbleImageView` of a `JSQMessagesCollectionViewCell` is now _part of the cell prototype_. This change is reflected in `JSQMessagesCollectionViewDataSource` as well as `JSQMessagesBubbleImageFactory`.

``` objective-c
// Changes in JSQMessagesCollectionViewDataSource

// OLD
- (UIImageView *)collectionView:(JSQMessagesCollectionView *)collectionView bubbleImageViewForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;

// NEW
- (id<JSQMessageBubbleImageDataSource>)collectionView:(JSQMessagesCollectionView *)collectionView messageBubbleImageDataForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
```

**JSQMessagesBubbleImageFactory**
You can now supply your own message bubble images and the factory class now generates `JSQMessagesBubbleImage` objects using those images. (You can also use the default bubble images.)

**JSQMessageAvatarImageDataSource**
This new data source protocol replaces the use of `imageView` objects for avatar image views. The `avatarImageView` of a `JSQMessagesCollectionViewCell` is now _part of the cell prototype_. This change is reflected in `JSQMessagesCollectionViewDataSource` as well as `JSQMessagesAvatarImageFactory`.

``` objective-c
// Changes in JSQMessagesCollectionViewDataSource

// OLD
- (UIImageView *)collectionView:(JSQMessagesCollectionView *)collectionView avatarImageViewForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;

// NEW
- (id<JSQMessageAvatarImageDataSource>)collectionView:(JSQMessagesCollectionView *)collectionView avatarImageDataForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
```

**JSQMessagesAvatarImageFactory**
Previously named `JSQMessagesAvatarFactory`. This factory class now generates `JSQMessageAvatarImage` objects.

**TypingIndicator and LoadEarlierMessagesHeader**
The properties how have more customization options. The `typingIndicatorColor` has been removed from `JSQMessagesViewController`.

New properties on `JSQMessagesCollectionView`:
- `typingIndicatorDisplaysOnLeft`
- `typingIndicatorMessageBubbleColor`
- `typingIndicatorEllipsisColor`
- `loadEarlierMessagesHeaderTextColor`

**JSQMessagesCollectionViewCell**
Now has a `mediaView` property and `mediaCellReuseIdentifier`.

**JSQMessagesViewController**
Now has `outgoingMediaCellIdentifier` and `incomingMediaCellIdentifier` properties. As before, you may still provide custom cells with custom identifiers. See the docs for more details.

**Bug fixes!**
See the [complete list of bug fixes](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController/issues?q=milestone%3A%22Release+6.0%22+label%3Abug) for details. :tada: 

## Localization

The library is now localized in 14 languages! 

Localization includes the ""Send"", ""New Message"", and ""Load Earlier Messages"" strings. Need a language that isn't supported? Please submit a PR!

This feature was truly a community effort. Thanks to all who contributed! See #237 for details.

## Interoperability with Swift

This library uses uses [modern Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/ModernizationObjC/AdoptingModernObjective-C/AdoptingModernObjective-C.html) and follows current [best practices](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/) to facilitate Swift interoperability. You should not have any issues using this library with Swift, but if you do please open a new issue. Simply add the `JSQMessages.h` umbrella header to your bridging header for Swift.

- Improved handling of the copy menu (`UIMenuController`) for a cell (activated by a long press gesture on a cell). It is now much more reliable and **does not** dismiss the keyboard when appearing.
- You can now add your own custom menu options/actions to the menu! Simply override the following delegate methods in your view controller subclass. _Don't forget to call super at the end of each._

``` objective-c
- (BOOL)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView shouldShowMenuForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;

- (BOOL)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView canPerformAction:(SEL)action forItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath withSender:(id)sender;

- (void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView performAction:(SEL)action forItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath withSender:(id)sender;
```
- New properties available on `JSQMessagesCollectionViewCell`! The following private properties have now been exposed. Use with caution. See the [most recent documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/JSQMessagesViewController/5.3.0/) for details.

``` objective-c
@property (weak, nonatomic, readonly) UIView *messageBubbleContainerView;
@property (weak, nonatomic, readonly) UIView *avatarContainerView;
```
- The following has been removed from `JSQMessagesCollectionViewCell`. (Due to the changes regarding the `UIMenuController` above)

``` objective-c
@property (weak, nonatomic, readonly) UILongPressGestureRecognizer *longPressGestureRecognizer;
```

- Springiness is now **disabled by default**, and labeled as an experimental feature in the docs. It is mostly stable, but not quite perfected. In order to opt-in, set this property to `YES`:

``` objective-c
- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated
{
    [super viewDidAppear:animated];
    self.collectionView.collectionViewLayout.springinessEnabled = YES;
}
```
- Better KVO handling, no longer hits the exception breakpoint. (#285)
- Showing the `typingIndicator` footer and `loadEarlierMessages` header now display reliably. However, some minor UI issues still sometimes occur if `springiness` is enabled. 
- When setting `self.showTypingIndicator = YES`, you now need to scroll to the bottom yourself, using `scrollToBottomAnimated:`
- Lots of other bug fixes and improvements! (see below)
- Docs updated for changes

`JSQMessagesViewController`*\* is now over 1 year old and has come a _**long way**_ with over 250 total issues closed to date.

This release is a complete rewrite of the library to move from a `tableView` implementation to a `collectionView` implementation. Overall, this library is now much more modular and robust.

Everything you need to know about this release is documented in issue #172 .

**This release is NOT backwards compatible, and it is only for iOS 7 and above.**

Many thanks to all those who contributed.
