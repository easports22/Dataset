- Fixed a regression where domain names were not properly excluded from the logic that prepends the URL host to the path components (#88).

- (NSArray <JLRRouteDefinition *> *)routes;

```objc
- (void)addRoute:(JLRRouteDefinition *)routeDefinition;
```
- Turned on some stricter warning settings, including warnings as errors.
- Started improving documentation, more to come on this front.

- Massive code cleanup in both JLRoutes.m and the unit test .m.
- Deprecated a bunch of class-method APIs that I don't want to support anymore. All depreciated APIs can be easily replaced by calling the same method on the `+globalRoutes` instance instead.
- Fixed a bug where `unmatchedURLHandler` would get called when evaluating `canRouteURL:`.
