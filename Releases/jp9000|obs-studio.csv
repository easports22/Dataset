This wizard is currently in beta and may be subject to change, feedback is appreciated.
* Added a stats dialog to the view menu (with the option to show it on start it up in general settings).  The stats dialog shows advanced statistics, such as: average frame rendering time, frames lost due to encoding/rendering/network lag, HDD space left in recording location, and how much data has been output total.
* Added a ""Render Delay"" filter that allows delaying non-async video sources such as display capture or window capture.  Note this is only meant for minor sync adjustments (e.g. syncing your screen capture to a webcam), and because the delayed frames are stored on very limited VRAM, the allowable maximum delay is 500 milliseconds (which is 250 megabytes of VRAM on a 1080p 60 FPS source)
* Added the ability to copy and paste filters between sources
* Added Ctrl-E as a shortcut to edit transform of sources

* Added the ability to project a source, scene, or the preview on to a resizable window in the right-click context menu when right-clicking on sources or the preview
* Reworked the media source: media files set to activate when switching to a scene will now immediately start play back when you switch to their scene without requiring time to load
* Reworked the media source: media files will now loop properly with no abnormalities in sound playback
* Fixed a bug where scenes could be unintentionally lost under specific crash circumstances (backup files were always present, but were not being used -- this is now fixed)
* Fixed an issue where the blackmagic source can start up or spontaneously go out of sync
* Fixed dragging and dropping text files to create a text source on non-windows systems
* Fixed a bug where devices outputting NV12 (e.g. Logitech BRIO cams) would have distorted colors
* Fixed a bug where frame dropping would not happen properly when using the ultrafast x264 preset
* Fixed a bug from 18.0.2 where ""downmix to mono"" would no longer save
* Fixed a potential crash under specific circumstances when OBS is set to minimize to task tray
* When dragging and dropping text files to create a source, those sources will now have the same name as the text file being dropped
* All dialogs should now have close buttons (useful on certain window managers such as gnome)
* Filter names are now sorted when adding new filters

19.0 Windows Changes
--------------------

* Fixed an issue where the device source would activate on startup even when it's in another scene and set to deactivate when not visible
* Fixed and clarified window capture prioritization.  ""Title"" will now match any window of the exact window title, ""class"" will try to find a window by the title otherwise match any window of the same window type, and ""exe"" will match any window of the same title or if not found any window of the same program.
* Fixed a crash when using QSV to encode
* Fixed a bug where log files wouldn't be created when the current windows user had unicode characters in the name
* Fixed an issue with the AMD encoder which would make it difficult to seek on certain file types
* (Repeating 18.0.2 in case it was missed) Fixed poor game capture performance with some DirectX 9 games on the Windows 10 ""Creator's Update"" as well as some cases Windows 7

19.0 Linux Changes
------------------

""Title"" will now match any window of the exact window title, ""class"" will try to find a window by the title otherwise match any window of the same window type, and ""exe"" will match any window of the same title or if not found any window of the same program.
* Fixed a crash when using QSV to encode
* Fixed a bug where log files wouldn't be created when the current windows user had unicode characters in the name
* Fixed an issue with the AMD encoder which would make it difficult to seek on certain file types
* (Repeating 18.0.2 in case it was missed) Fixed poor game capture performance with some DirectX 9 games on the Windows 10 ""Creator's Update"" as well as some cases Windows 7

- Added a Gradient feature to the GDI+ text source (not fully localized yet however)
- Fixed an NVENC crash that could happen occasionally
- Fixed a few minor issues with AMD encoder presets
- Once again, fixed a bug where the window's position would reset on startup (hopefully)

0.16.1 Hotfix Changes:
- Fixed a bug where the main window's position/size wouldn't save on exit
- Fixed a bug where files under 3 bytes wouldn't be read by text sources
- Changed text source file change update interval to one second

0.16.0 General Changes:
- Added a automatic scene switcher via the tools menu on windows/mac (and linux eventually) that can switch scenes based upon what program/window is currently in focus on the system.  More features to be added in future versions.  On macs, you can only select applications, not windows.  Note that you can also use regex to match a window name.
- Added a system tray icon, with the ability to control the program via the system tray, and the ability to hide to system tray.
- Added the ability to drag and drop image/video files in to the program to create new sources on the fly (note that on windows this may not work properly if the program is running as administrator, the source being dragged from may also need to be run as administrator)
- Added an FPS indicator to the status bar, mostly used to diagnose whether a source in the scene is causing rendering to lag.
- Added a ""b-frames"" option to the NVENC encoder, and set the default to 2.  Also fixes an issue where b-frames weren't being used by default, which would impact video quality.
- Added a front-end API for developers
- Fixed an issue where frames wouldn't drop under certain circumstances and become more delayed than expected.
- Fixed an issue where the program couldn't connect to certain types of custom servers.
- Fixed a bug where NVENC H.264 profile wouldn't be set.
- Fixed a bug with the browser source that would cause it to sometimes freeze under certain circumstances (especially changing settings, deleting the source, starting the program, or shutting down the program).
- Fixed a bug where URLs wouldn't work with the VLC video source.
- Fixed a bug where hidden sources used by the slideshow source would show up in the ""existing source"" list when adding a new image.
- Streams will now always stop after a maximum of 30 seconds regardless of buffering (though buffering should no longer happen)
- You can now click ""Stopping Stream..."" or ""Stopping Recording..."" to force them to stop if they are stuck in a ""stopping"" state for whatever reason (typically streaming, caused by buffering such as with the aforementioned frame drop issue)

0.16.0 Windows-specific Changes:
- Added an AMD H.264 encoder for AMD video cards on windows (also pre-configured settings available in simple output mode).  Note that this plugin should still be considered an early/experimental build; please report issues on the plugin's repository here: https://github.com/Xaymar/OBS-AMD-Advanced-Media-Framework
- Added an improved text source with many more features and better drawing language support, and deprecated the old text source.  Any lingering text sources you have saved will still use the old source, so if you want to use the new text source you'll have to create a new text source for them.  A new text source is also in the works for mac/linux.
- Added a tooltip to the ""use buffering"" property in the video device capture source properties that explains its function.
- Game capture should now no longer require a hotfixes every time windows updates and changes D3D9 libraries.

0.16.0 Linux-specific Changes:
- Added the ability to specify a custom audio device when using the ALSA audio capture source.
- Fixed a design flaw with the pulseaudio capture where the source would have no properties if the device was unplugged since last time the program was opened.

- Fixed a bug where files under 3 bytes wouldn't be read by text sources
- Changed text source file change update interval to one second

0.16.0 General Changes:
- Added an automatic scene switcher via the tools menu on windows/mac (and linux eventually) that can switch scenes based upon what program/window is currently in focus on the system.  More features to be added in future versions.  On macs, you can only select applications, not windows.  Note that you can also use regex to match a window name.
- Added a system tray icon, with the ability to control the program via the system tray, and the ability to hide to system tray.
- Added the ability to drag and drop image/video files in to the program to create new sources on the fly (note that on windows this may not work properly if the program is running as administrator, the source being dragged from may also need to be run as administrator)
- Added an FPS indicator to the status bar, mostly used to diagnose whether a source in the scene is causing rendering to lag.
- Added a ""b-frames"" option to the NVENC encoder, and set the default to 2.  Also fixes an issue where b-frames weren't being used by default, which would impact video quality.
- Added a front-end API for developers
- Fixed an issue where frames wouldn't drop under certain circumstances and become more delayed than expected.
- Fixed an issue where the program couldn't connect to certain types of custom servers.
- Fixed a bug where NVENC H.264 profile wouldn't be set.
- Fixed a bug with the browser source that would cause it to sometimes freeze under certain circumstances (especially changing settings, deleting the source, starting the program, or shutting down the program).
- Fixed a bug where URLs wouldn't work with the VLC video source.
- Fixed a bug where hidden sources used by the slideshow source would show up in the ""existing source"" list when adding a new image.
- Streams will now always stop after a maximum of 30 seconds regardless of buffering (though buffering should no longer happen)
- You can now click ""Stopping Stream..."" or ""Stopping Recording..."" to force them to stop if they are stuck in a ""stopping"" state for whatever reason (typically streaming, caused by buffering such as with the aforementioned frame drop issue)

0.16.0 Windows-specific Changes:
- Added an AMD H.264 encoder for AMD video cards on windows (also pre-configured settings available in simple output mode).  Note that this plugin should still be considered an early/experimental build; please report issues on the plugin's repository here: https://github.com/Xaymar/OBS-AMD-Advanced-Media-Framework
- Added an improved text source with many more features and better drawing language support, and deprecated the old text source.  Any lingering text sources you have saved will still use the old source, so if you want to use the new text source you'll have to create a new text source for them.  A new text source is also in the works for mac/linux.
- Added a tooltip to the ""use buffering"" property in the video device capture source properties that explains its function.
- Game capture should now no longer require a hotfixes every time windows updates and changes D3D9 libraries.

0.16.0 Linux-specific Changes:
- Added the ability to specify a custom audio device when using the ALSA audio capture source.
- Fixed a design flaw with the pulseaudio capture where the source would have no properties if the device was unplugged since last time the program was opened.

- Fixed performance issues with Direct3D 9.0c games on the latest windows 10 update

0.15.1 Hotfix Changes:
- Fixed a display bug with the scroll filter
- Fixed a crash that would happen when you created a VLC/slideshow source, added one item, then removed that item from the list, then hit cancel
- Fixed a crash that would happen if you deleted a scene being used as a source in another scene when it automatically switched to that scene after deletion
- Fixed a bug where quakelive wouldn't capture properly

0.15.0 General Changes:
- Added an image slideshow source.  The image slideshow has an playlist (which you can also add directories to as well), the ability to use different types of transitions, and the ability to randomize the output
- Added a VLC video source with playlist support via libVLC.  Note that this currently requires VLC to be installed on your computer (on windows, for the architecture you're using OBS with.  For example, if you're using 64bit OBS Studio, you need 64bit VLC).  libVLC library files will most likely end up being optionally provided by the installer in the future.  This plugin works with windows and mac, and should work with linux (though hasn't had as much testing there).
- Added ""View"" menu to allow hiding parts of the user interface (just listbox toolbars, status bar, and transition pane currently)
- Added the ability to to set the scaling sampling filter for each item within a scene (point, bilinear, bicubic, and lanczos filtering).  Right-click a source within a scene to set the sampling.  This allows improving general source scaling quality for each item within a scene if desired (at the cost of additional fillrate).
- Added ""Scale/Aspect Ratio"" filter which can force a specific resolution or aspect ratio on a source (with a specific desired scale sampling filter).
- Added an option to automatically start recording when streaming
- Added ""Hide cursor over projector"" option to general settings
- Added the ability to delete multiple selected sources
- Changed ""Crop"" filter to ""Crop/Pad"" filter to allow it to pad in addition to crop.
- You can now add other scenes as sources within scenes.  Note that it will automatically detect and prevent infinite recursion, you cannot add a scene or source if it causes infinite recursion.
- When stopping recording/streaming, it will no longer cut off video at the end.  It will now stop in accordance to the timing in which you hit the button.  Buttons will now say ""stopping stream"" or ""stopping recording"" while waiting for the point in which to stop the stream/recording to ensure it stops at the right timing.
- You can now specify directories with the file formatting option in advanced settings.
- Increased the maximum delay for the async delay filter to 20 seconds
- Whenever an image source gif appears on the stream/recording output, it now restarts the gif from the first frame
- Fixed another potential freeze/crash when disconnecting/reconnecting
- Fixed NVENC lossless mode, should now work as intended
- Fixed a bug where regular lossless codecs and lossless via simple output mode were only using one core
- Fixed a bug where the rate control would not be set for x264 under certain circumstances

0.15.0 Windows-Specific Changes:
- Fixed a bug where audio output devices wouldn't show up in the video device capture source under certain circumstances
- Fixed a bug with game capture where certain blizzard games could crash if the device was lost and reinitialized in the game
- Improved game capture capture performance for certain OpenGL games
- Added process priority option to advanced settings

- Fixed a potential freeze when reconnecting
- Fixed a potential crash when disconnecting on program shutdown
- Fixed a bug with transitions where under certain circumstances the audio from the target scene would not start playing until the transition was completed
- Fixed a few potential freezes and other bugs with the media source
- Fixed a bug where using ""rescale"" with the QSV encoder wouldn't work properly
- Fixed a bug where deinterlaced sources would sometimes appear vertically flipped when deinterlacing was enabled
- Fixed a bug where alt-crop wouldn't work properly if a source was flipped
- Fixed a bug where you couldn't save a recording to a file or path that contained unicode characters
- Fixed a bug where simple output mode would not record QSV at the expected bitrates relative to ""high"" and ""indistinguishable"" quality on haswell+ processors
- Fixed a bug where switching from a scene collection with custom transitions could corrupt the scene collection being switched to
- Fixed an issue where the browser plugin would have poor performance under certain circumstances
- Fixed an issue where the browser plugin wouldn't play back WebGL
- Fixed an issue where NVENC would use too much bitrate unnecessarily when recording, now uses CQP instead of VBR
- Fixed an issue where NVENC constant bitrate wasn't working properly
- Window capture on windows will no longer display anything if the window has been closed and can no longer be found.  Before it would display a frozen image of the window before it was closed
- Game capture on windows will now prevent itself from hooking OBS projector windows when game capture is set to capture any fullscreen program
- Game capture on windows will now try to initialize capture immediately when possible, especially on games/programs that are already hooked
- Game capture on windows no longer acts as a global source, and when not being shown it will fully deactivate (for example it's in another scene).  This fixes an issue where game capture would sometimes show a black screen if there were other separate game captures in different scenes capturing the same thing
- Monitor capture on windows no longer acts as a global source, and when not being shown it will fully deactivate (again for example when it's in another scene).  This fixes an issue on windows 8/10+ where monitor capture would cause unexpected lag while in a different scene when a fullscreen game is active
- Projectors no longer minimize if the main window is minimized
- If the main OBS window was closed on a monitor that's no longer plugged in, it will now start up on the main display rather than starting up off-screen
- When changing encoders in advanced output mode, settings from the previous encoder will no longer try to apply to the new encoder, which may have a completely different setting layout
- Changed the browse dialogs for the remux dialog to show the various supported file types rather than just FLV/MP4
- Changed x264 and NVENC to have a ""rate control"" setting instead of a ""Use CBR"" setting
- Increased NVENC bitrate limit
- Added CQP rate control mode to NVENC encoder interface
- ~~Added lossless rate control mode to NVENC encoder interface~~ (woops, this may actually not be functional yet, will be fixed next patch)
- Added CRF rate control mode to x264 encoder interface (functions the same as when you're using VBR with 0 buffer size)
- Added ABR rate control mode to x264 encoder interface (functions similar to CBR but without bitrate padding)
- FFmpeg now is compiled with VP8 and VP9 support on windows

- Fixed an issue with chroma key not working at all
- Fixed an issue where media source wouldn't loop gif files correctly anymore
- Fixed an issue where checking for file/version updates would fail on windows 7

0.14.0 General Changes:
- Added deinterlacing.  Deinterlacing modes can now be used by right-clicking the source and going to ""deinterlacing"" in the menu to select the deinterlacing options.  Deinterlacing only works on sources that support it (video capture device source and media source primarily)
- Added full NVIDIA NVENC encoder and deprecated the Microsoft Media Foundation NVENC encoder.  NVENC is supported for windows and linux, and can be used via the simple output mode.  (Note: To use NVENC on linux, you must compile or get a version of FFmpeg with NVENC support)
- Added full Intel QuickSync encoder and deprecated the Microsoft Media Foundation QuickSync encoder.  The full QuickSync implementation is currently only supported on windows, and can be used via the simple output mode.
- Added alt-cropping (cropping via the alt-key).  This type of crop only affects the specific scene item and does not affect all instances of a source.  You can also change the specific crop number values in the source transform dialog.
- Added a 'slide' transition.  This is different from the swipe transition in that it slides in the new scene while sliding out the old scene (HWD)
- Added a 'fade to color' transition.  This transition fades to a color and then fades to the target scene from that color. (HWD)
- Added command line parameters:  --collection [scene collection name], --profile [profile name], --scene [scene name], --startstreaming, --startrecording.  If a collection/profile/scene has a space in the name, use quotes around the full name.
- Added ""snap to other sources"" feature (enabled by default, can be disabled in general settings)
- Added ""snap to vertical/horizontal center"" feature (disabled by default, option to enable is in general settings)
- Added the ability to turn off all snapping in general settings (reminder that you can always temporarily disable snapping by holding down the control key while dragging/resizing)
- Added options to change the recording file name formatting in advanced settings
- Simple output mode now has an option to disable the current service's bitrate enforcement
- Simple output mode now shows a warning if your bitrate goes over the service's maximum desired bitrate if bitrate enforcement is disabled, stating that the bitrate will be capped at the service's maximum preferred bitrate
- Fixed a bug where image/text sources could majorly lag if they had file names with non-english (particularly east-asian) unicode characters
- Fixed a bug with decklink source where older blackmagic/decklink devices wouldn't properly show
- Fixed a number of crashes with the media source
- Fixed an issue with lanczos scaling quality, quality should now be more accurate/improved
- Fixed an issue where audio and video could start up out of sync on a second output that uses already-active encoders (for example, you start streaming, and then start recording a few second later, then the recording could be out of sync)
- Fixed a crash that could happen when closing a properties/filters window
- Fixed a crash on startup that would happen if you had a filter with the same name as an existing source
- Fixed a bug where the text of a text source would disappear when using certain filters
- Fixed a bug where the text source could crash if the text was too big
- Reduced the amount of memory used by text source glyphs
- When browsing files with the media/image sources, the browse dialog now starts in the directory of the last file used

0.14.0 General Windows-Specific Changes:
- Added an option to the video device capture source which allows turning off the device when the device is not being displayed (also useful if you need to output audio to desktop and don't want the audio to play when you're in a different scene)
- Added monochrome color format support to video device capture for certain devices that use it (why on earth anyone would have a monochrome camera I don't know)
- Fixed an issue where game capture would stop capturing a game if there were other hooks active
- Fixed a bug where the cursor could become corrupted when using window/game/monitor capture
- Fixed a crash that could happen when initializing audio capture

0.14.0 General Linux-Specific Changes:
- Added an option ""Use alpha-less texture format"" option to window capture that helps capturing certain windows with mesa drivers
- Added an ALSA sound input source (currently added like any other source, will be accessible via audio settings as well in the future)

- Fixed a case where audio would completely stop playing from certain sources
- Fixed a case where audio for certain sources would go out of sync
- Fixed multiple cases where buffering would increase unnecessarily
- Fixed an issue where outputs could potentially start up out of sync
- Fixed an issue where multi-track outputs would take many seconds to start up
- Fixed a bug where multi-track audio outputs would potentially not be in sync
- Fixed a bug with the output (program) view in studio mode where it would not update its resolution when resolution settings have been changed
- Fixed a bug (that has been around since before 0.13.0) where if you start a secondary output with already-active encoders, it could go out of sync if started very shortly after the first output.  Secondary outputs started with already active encoders will now always be in sync
- Fixed a crash that could happen when transitioning under certain circumstances
- Fixed the ""del"" button not working on scenes/sources

## OBS Multiplatform 0.13.0 Changes:

General Changes:
- Added ""Studio Mode"", which allows editing scenes/sources without changing the output (also known as Preview/Program mode)
- Added scene transitions (currently only had time for just fade/cut, many more transitions to be added later)
- Added support for animated gif playback in the image source and even the mask/blend filter
- Added an option to the media source to allow the ability to restart the media file when the source becomes active (shown on output)
- Added options to settings -> general to add confirmation dialogs for starting/stopping stream (was requested because sometimes people can accidentally click start/stop streaming when they don't mean to)
- Added an ""Always On Top"" option to file menu
- Added the ability to adjust the size of the bottom section of the main window
- Added logging of active monitors to logs when using Direct3D
- Fixed the annoying way in which the mask/blend filter would always stretch the mask/blend image by default, discarding aspect ratio.  It now centers on the source and preserves aspect ratio.  An option has been added to stretch to discard aspect ratio if desired.
- Fixed the media source file browse dialog so that filters for actual media files rather than just listing all files
- Fixed a bug where the output resolution would always select an improper resolution if the base resolution becomes invalid
- Fixed a bug where right-clicking on a source in the preview and going to properties/transform would get the properties/transform of the wrong source
- Fixed a bug where if the program was started and the current global desktop/mic audio audio devices in audio settings couldn't be found, audio settings would erroneously select ""disabled"" even though they were still active.  It now displays ""[Device not connected or not available]"".
- Fixed a bug where when starting the program for the first time, no default scenes would be present
- Fixed a crash that would happen if you had a hotkey set to start both stream/recording at the same time
- Fixed a crash that could happen under certain circumstances if you were streaming/recording at the same time
- Fixed a bug where starting streaming and then starting recording quickly after or vice-versa would cause the second one to go out of sync
- Improved logging of lost frames due to rendering, encoding, or network lag
- Completely rewrote the audio subsystem, which enables the ability for transitions, minimizes audio buffering, and removes the need for the ""audio buffering time"" setting
- Cleaned up the properties of the media source: now defaults to file output mode, uses reasonable defaults
- Moved renderer/adapter from video settings to advanced settings because they're not something users should typically mess with
- The renderer/adapter options are now hidden when they're not applicable (hiding both options on OSX, linux, and hiding adapters when OpenGL is selected on windows)
- The status bar now displays a warning if encoding is overloaded suggesting the user turn down settings

Windows Changes:
- Fixed a bug with game capture where OpenGL games wouldn't capture properly under certain circumstances
- Fixed a bug where Darkest Dungeon wouldn't capture/render properly

Mac Changes:
- Improved rendering performance by disabling OSX BeamSync while the program is active (can be disabled/enabled in advanced settings)

Linux Changes:
- Testing a possible fix to an issue where window capture rarely/randomly causing segfaults (usually on exit)
- Improved rendering performance by fixing an issue where the program was rendering with v-sync

- Added a profiler to the back-end to help to help determine potential system bottlenecks
- Added custom muxer settings to FFmpeg output in advanced output mode
- Changed the back-end to use a windowless graphics context (mostly as a refactor, but to also allow things like CLI-only front-ends later)
- Changed the FFmpeg output in advanced output mode to allow the use of generated filenames rather than overwriting the same file over and over again
- Changed default theme icons to look better and more consistent, especially in comparison to the dark theme
- Changed the video settings so that changing base resolution would not modify the scaled output resolution if they are of the same aspect ratio
- Moved reconnect options to advanced settings to clean up output section interface
- Removed ""Enable CBR option"" from simple output stream settings.  CBR is always on for streaming (unless service-specific settings are disabled in advanced output mode stream settings)
- Removed 22.05khz audio sample rate selection from audio settings
- The program will now prevent the computer from going to sleep and screen saving while active
- Improved CoreAudio AAC encoder logging
- Fixed a bug with the properties window where the window would always start off at the smallest size
- Fixed a bug with the media source where streams and certain files would not play audio
- Fixed a bug where adding certain audio sync offsets could cause the program to crash
- Fixed a bug where canceling reconnection would cause the user to be unable to start the stream again until the program was restarted
- Fixed a bug with FFmpeg output in advanced output mode where it could crash when selecting certain extensions
- Fixed an issue where log entries could repeat endlessly without limit (now caps log duplication after a certain limit)
- Fixed an issue where the program would not start up at all if certain settings were no longer valid

Linux specific changes:
- Window capture (xcomposite) will now automatically try to reacquire the window it was set to capture but may have been closed by the user

Windows specific changes:
- Added Media Foundation encoders, which has support for QuickSync, NVENC, and VCE.  Note however that these are a different from their ""primary"" implementations, and have limitations.  Media Foundation NVENC for example only has support on windows 10 currently.  The Media Foundation Quicksync encoder only works with Haswell level and better.  These encoders should be considered experimental, and currently are only available via advanced output mode.  Note also that NVENC and VCE are not currently recommended for streaming due to lack of proper CBR support.
- Fixed an issue where the video device source would crash if blackmagic drivers are installed but no blackmagic device is present
- Fixed an issue where crash reports would not generate proper stack traces
- Fixed a bug with game capture where high FPS games (games running above 100 FPS) would have poor capture performance
- Fixed a bug with game capture where 64bit games would sometimes crash when hooked
- Fixed a bug where game capture would fail to capture certain OpenGL games when using certain hardware (primarily older hardware with limited capture extension support)

Mac specific changes:
- Added Apple VideoToolbox Encoders.  These are considered experimental and not recommended for streaming yet.  Currently only available in the advanced output mode.

Okay, so mac users are constantly asking for a way to stream.  Apparently there aren't many good streaming solutions on mac, so I figured I may as well release a build if people just want to at least stream/record their screens or webcams (and possible even some capture devices, not sure about how supported each one is yet though).

This is a super early work-in-progress build for people who have been constantly asking.  It still doesn't do much, but you can at least stream your desktop efficiently.

I know it's still may not seem like much right now, but please bear with us and follow our progress as the new multiplatform version matures.  Eventually, this new code will get all the vital features filled in for each operating system, and will even replace the current windows version.

Rewriting something so large from scratch is dangerous and incredibly ambitious, but we have been successful and have pulled through the worst of the worst to get to this point, it's absolutely been worth it.  I've learned so much, and it's been an honor meeting some amazing programmers and becoming a part of such an awesome community.  I may contribute the majority of the code, but the fact is without everyone who's been involved, this really wouldn't have been possible.

I'm not currently releasing the windows version of the rewrite because there are too many important features lacking for it to really be usable, like game capture and video device capture, which I'm going to be rewriting from the bottom up as well (and they of all things need it especially).  Linux is a different matter entirely due to package management, and it's too early to make a real 'release' for linux, despite the fact that it's about in the same state.

**Read this before asking about features**
- IMPORTANT: Scene editing is not yet implemented, it's next up on the agenda.  This is very important to note.
- Bitmap sources are not yet implemented, also next up on the agenda as it's also pretty important.
- Custom x264 settings entry has not yet been implemented.
- Video device capture is in for mac (all hail palana), but because of lack of scene editing, you can't really put it in to a corner of your stream at the moment - It's still very unstable.  Expect crashes, and give us crash and bug reports if possible.
- Downscale sharpening shaders have not been implemented yet, so scaling down will be a little bit blurry.
- Saving/loading/switching/importing/exporting scene profiles hasn't been implemented yet.
- This is the 'basic' user interface, meant to be simple and easy to use for casual users, keep in mind that there are other user interfaces that are in the works, and this interface still has many improvements to be added.
- Only supports OSX 10.8+.
- Don't expect major support right now, this is an incomplete test build, most of our users and support people are windows users and aren't very familiar with mac, so you're on your own right now.
- There are still a bazillion things down the road, most things you probably want are most likely already planned or in the works.

EDIT: 'Wavtap' may be better for capturing desktop sound.  It's apparently super easy to use.  Soundflower is a pain.  Thanks to those who pointed this out!

Wavtap download:  https://github.com/downloads/pje/WavTap/WavTap%200.2.0.pkg

'Soundflower' is also available to capture desktop sound on mac:
