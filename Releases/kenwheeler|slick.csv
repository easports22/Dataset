PR from @msrafi #1467 
**notes:** due to `tabindex` property, some browsers may include default styling to highlight the slide which has focus. You can override this with `.slick-slide:focus { outline:0 }` or _even better_ to **make the slide appear highlighted in some way** for your users with poor sight.

---

### `slide` option fixed

PR from @simeydotme #1357
**notes:** fixes #1517 and #1353 regarding the `slide` option **not filtering the carousel properly** (at all).  

---

### Enhancing the arrow states

PR from @simeydotme #1331
**notes:** default and **custom arrows should now hide correctly**, also there is a new css class `slick-hidden` which will default hide the arrows when there's not enough slides to slide, where as `slick-disabled` can be used to indicate when the slider has reached the end of a non-infinite carousel.  

---

### Setting Responsive Options in `setOption` method

PR from @simeydotme #1334
**notes:** fixing #327 and closing #335 this should now allow **setting of n \* breakpoint responsive settings** with the `setOption` method using code like: , `.slick(""setOption"", ""responsive"", [{ ... }]);` .. for an example you can see the new syntax working here: http://jsfiddle.net/simeydotme/54a9d57t/

https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/commit/0cc90310d89cfefef3334a9366eed97ff013e41e

### Vertical Margin fix

PR from @nyusaf #1499
**notes:** Fixes a bug whereby the vertical margins on a vertical slider were incorrectly calculated by `.outerHeight()` method as described in #1498  

---

### Bower package name fixed

PR from @sindhus 
**notes:** Bower package name was out of date. Sorted.  

---

### `currentSlide` option fixed

PR from @janrode #1376
**notes:** the `initialSlide` option was being used during breakpoints, instead of `currentSlide` causing the slide to reset back to initial value. Fixed.  

---

### lazy loaded images fixed

PR from @simeydotme #1360
**notes:** fixing #1354 where the images were not being given the correct `opacity` after loading. It was to do with a race condition. Fixed.  

---

### `z-index` improvement

PR from @nominalaeon
**notes:** closes #896 regarding the `z-index`es being really crazy. New option set in the slider: `zIndex`.  

---

### `fade` option improvement

PR from @ethanclevenger91
**notes:** closes many issues regarding the fading of slides. https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/commit/3bfae6116ec9f3ea7a9dd591245514e2827e3f97

895659,2015-01-29T04:19:33Z,2015-01-29T04:24:16Z,1.4 - BREAKING CHANGES (Please read),"Whats up guys! Sorry I took a month off there for the holidays. I wanted to make it up to you, so lets check out whats new in Slick 1.4:

### Settings

A few new settings have been added:
- `edgeFriction` - This is an integer value for non-infinite carousels that adds resistance to edge drags. If you don't want resistance, set it to 1.
- `mobileFirst` - When set to true, this setting makes your responsive breakpoints evaluate mobile first.
- `responsive` - The responsive setting has been updated to accept a string value of ""unslick"" for the settings portion of a breakpoint declaration. This makes slick unslick at the given breakpoint. Note, you can't window shrink this, once you unslick, you are unslicked. 
- `slide` -  The default value of the slide option has been changed to blank. This means that slick will use any direct children as slides, without having to specify which tag or selector to target.

### Data Attribute Settings

Slick now has the ability to initialize via a data attribute. Provide a valid json object in the `data-slick` attribute, and you don't even need to initialize slick, it will initialize and apply the provided settings.

### Methods

All methods are now called via the slick method. So you create slick with `$.slick(options)`, but then you can also run `$.slick('method', arguments)`. Check the docs for more detail.

### Events

All callback methods are now deprecated. They have been replaced with event triggers. I added a few helpful ones too. So onAfterChange is now:

```
$('.your-element').on('afterChange', function(){
    // do stuff
});
```

### CSS

`slick.css` has been forked into two different files. `slick.css` is now the core functional slick css file, while `slick-theme.css` and `slick-theme.scss` are the default styling.

### Wrap up

So I've added some cool new shit, and I'm sorry about the breaking changes, but they are absolutely for the better moving forward. Like any set of new features, I'm sure somebody will find the perfect combination of settings to make this thing shit the bed, so I'll make sure I'm around to get 1.4.1 out the door when they do. I'm looking forward to adding some cool new, non-breaking stuff in the near future, so keep your eyes peeled for some optimizations and improvements. Thanks so much!

That said, I have made the executive decision to keep the swipe action for vertical sliding horizontal. I translated the slider width vs slider height so you still have proportional movement, but vertical swiping is for scrolling down a webpage. Not interacting with a component. 

I've built a gillion of these things, and fucking with vertical scroll is bad UX.
