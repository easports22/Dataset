2313024,2015-12-18T17:31:35Z,2015-12-18T17:37:06Z,v4.3.1: Security release,"There is a security vulnerability with how requests are normalized when using Rails' ActionDispatch.

Versions Affected:  < 4.3.0
Not affected: rack apps not using Rails
Fixed Versions: 4.3.1

## Impact 

When using rack-attack with a rails app, developers expect the request
path to be normalized. In particular, trailing slashes are stripped so
a request path ""/login/"" becomes ""/login"" by the time you're in
ActionController.

Since Rack::Attack runs before ActionDispatch, the request path is not
yet normalized. This can cause throttles and blacklists to not work as
expected.

E.g., a throttle:

```
throttle('logins', ...) {|req| req.path == ""/login"" }
```

would not match a request to '/login/', though Rails would route
'/login/' to the same '/login' action. 

## Releases

Install rack-attack 4.3.1 from rubygems.org.

```
# In Gemfile using bundler
gem 'rack-attack', '~> 4.3.1'
```

## Workarounds 

If you prefer not to upgrade, you may work around this issue by making sure your throttles, blacklists, etc handle an optional trailing slash in `req.path`. 

For example:

``` ruby
# Unsafe:
throttle(...) { |req| req.path == '/login' }

# Safe:
throttle(...) { |req| req.path == '/login' || req.path == '/login/' }
```

## Credit

This vulnerability was reported by Andres Riancho from Include Security (@includesecurity on GitHub and Twitter). Thank you, Andres & Include Security.

## Other changes in v4.3.1
- Remove support for ruby 1.9.x
- Add Code of Conduct
- Several documentation and testing improvements
