7657734,2017-09-06T17:46:03Z,2017-09-06T18:13:00Z,2.2,"* Bugfixes
* Added special access paths for some magic methods
* Sort methods by line number after hierarchy
* Sort properties with strnatcasecmp instead of strcmp
* Added blacklist to ToString plugin, add SimpleXMLElement by default
* Removed the value representation from unknown types
* Removed object property reflection
* Made some parser plugins opt-in:
    * Binary
    * Serialize
    * DOMNode/DOMIterator
* Renderers can now alter parser plugins before parsing
    * The text-based renderers now disable all the plugins they don't use ahead of time
* Added special access paths for more magic methods like `__toString`
* Dropped automated testing of PHP 5.2
    * 5.2 will be dropped when TravisCI drops it in april
    * 5.1 and 5.2 are still technically supported, but since (hopefully) no-one uses those any huge bugs will be fixed on an as-reported basis.
* Added Kint::dumpArray to allow you to supply your own object seeds (Names and access paths) along with an array of data. Useful for integrating with other systems.
    * This allows correct access paths for Kint::trace()",https://api.github.com/users/jnvsor,5260644,jnvsor,https://api.github.com/repos/kint-php/kint/releases/7657734/assets,https://api.github.com/repos/kint-php/kint/releases/7657734,master,https://api.github.com/repos/kint-php/kint/tarball/2.2,https://github.com/kint-php/kint/releases/tag/2.2,https://api.github.com/repos/kint-php/kint/zipball/2.2,2.2,False,False

* Disabled the binary, DOMNode, DOMIterator, and Serialize plugins. They're still there but you have to opt-in now. For reasons behind these choices see #244 
* Max depth has been lowered to 6. Because Kint currently supplies much more information than v1 did it's also a bit slower. This is compounded by the constantly increasing interdependent hierarchies in use in modern PHP systems. Because the access paths are a thing in Kint 2 it's very easy to run a second dump to get deeper in, so this will barely make a dent for usability, but lowering the depth limit one level typically cuts runtime in 3!
* There is now a `parserPlugins` method on the `Kint_Renderer` which can alter or supply a list of plugins for the parser to be initialized with. A whitelist on the text renderer makes use of this by disabling most of the plugins so text, cli, and plain dumps are fast.
* Dropped reference detection support below 5.2.1.

    * Missing ""Inherited from"" in docstrings
    * Renderers: Get return status from settings, not directly from modifiers
    * Sourceparser would explode on 5.1 and 5.2 (Since no-one brought that up it means we have pleasantly few people using those old versions)
    * Fixed a bug in certain browsers where tripleclick select all would add 4 spaces of indentation for some reason.
    * Fix bug in complex string parsing (""${var}"" would add an extra indentation level, causing the var name/access path to go on until the end of the containing block)
    * Make the shorthand (`d(1);`) show a backtrace to the same depth as `Kint::trace()`
    * PHPUnit failed to check for certain error levels in certain circumstances
    * Fixed a bug in the way the trace plugin validated traces. (Let's just say it was completely wrong)
* Added unit tests
    * Kint class
    * Kint_Parser_Trace plugin (Also used independently by helper for minitrace etc)

    * Kint_Object

    * And tweaks to parser, sourceparser tests
* Representation names now contain digits when automatically transferred from labels
* Added .gitattributes to clean up distributed archives and stop compiled files from messing up the diff view.
* Character encodings now work slightly different
    * ASCII and UTF-8 are the only ones enabled by default now (Should be a bit of a performance boost)
    * Some investigation has lead me to believe that `mb_detect_encoding` only practically supports
        * ASCII
        * UTF-8
        * SJIS
        * EUC-JP
    * Windows-1252 is using some custom validation if mb_detect_encoding fails, since just about any byte is valid in 1252
    * Accordingly, the Binary plugin will always trigger if the string is not UTF-8 or ASCII
* Blacklist '/' and '.' for FsPath plugin (Since those strings are likely to show up often)
* Moved string escaping into renderers
    * Deprecates `Kint_Object_Blob::escape` and `Kint_Renderer_Rich_Plugin::renderLockedHeader`, to be removed in next major version.
* Added Exception plugin (Shows message in bar)
* Added DateTime plugin (Shows value in bar)
* Added links to PHP documentation for internal functions and methods
* *Massive* performance improvement to the sourceparser. The base call time of Kint was a bit slow on very large files
