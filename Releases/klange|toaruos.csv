5498902,2017-02-18T14:19:23Z,2017-02-18T14:43:42Z,v1.0.4 - The VMware Update,"_This release has been superseded by a point release, [v1.1.0](https://github.com/klange/toaruos/releases/tag/v1.1.0)._

With apologies for putting out such a big update only a few days after the last one, this update is focused on providing better support for VMware. See [here](https://github.com/klange/toaruos/wiki/Building-and-Running#vmware-player--workstation) for instructions on using ToaruOS in VMware. There are also many general improvements and bug fixes in this release.

**VMware**: Fixes for several device drivers have been implemented to support VMware, including the VMware display driver, the ATA/ATAPI driver, network drivers, network subsystem, PCI subsystem, and more.

**VMware Mouse**: Support for the VMware backdoor absolute mouse has been added. This is supported in both VMware and QEMU and is enabled by default. In these environments, a panel widget will be displayed to toggle between absolute and relative modes as neither VM seems to provide an interface option for this (perhaps Workstation does, but I only have access to Player).

**ISO9660**: A very important bugfix, as well as major performance improvement have both been implemented in the ISO9660 filesystem driver.

**ToaruPaint**: The painting app now uses a damage region system for more efficient drawing.

**Network**: The network subsystem now has better support for gateways, ARP, and DHCP. It is still not recommended that ToaruOS be run on a live network, mostly due to an insufficient TCP stack. We are working to improve the real-world usability of ToaruOS's network stack.

**pcnet**: This driver now gracefully handles failures to initialize. Unfortunately, it does not yet work in VMware, but it will at least no longer lock up there...

**e1000**: Support for other PCI IDs has been added. This enables the remaining Intel PRO/1000 options in VirtualBox and allows the driver to work in VMware (when it is set to use the `e1000` device).

**ATAPI**: A bug in ATAPI polling which caused VMware to lock up has been fixed.

**PCI**: A bug in recursive PCI bus scanning which caused issues in VMware has been fixed.

**Video**: An ioctl has been added to the framebuffer to support setting the display mode. A bug in the `vmware` driver that used the framebuffer size instead of the vram size to calculate how much RAM to map has been fixed, allowing VMware guests to set larger modes.

**Panel**: The panel should no longer crash when `/dev/mixer` is not available, so you can disable the audio subsystem and still have a working desktop.

**QEMU**: An experimental system for notifying the guest of the QEMU window size has been added when using the SDL display backend under Linux. See `util/qemu-harness.py` for more details. A harness monitors the size of the SDL window and informs the guest over the serial port. The guest runs a script which monitors the serial port for these updates and performs mode setting. The harness then sends a signal to QEMU to have it disable scaling. This provides a very similar, if not better, experience to VirtualBox's display size guest addition.

## Known Issues

The VMware mouse driver may report incorrect positioning in VMware if the host window is moved. Resizing the window, and various other WM actions, should resolve the issue. QEMU does not exhibit this bug. It is believed this is an issue with VMware expecting additional signaling mechanisms from guests that enable the absolute mouse cursor, and this issue may not be resolvable on our end without significant effort.

This is a minor improvement over 1.0.2 with some usability and bug fixes.

**Kernel**: The PIT mode has been switched to 2 to workaround an issue in VirtualBox. It is believed that this should not affect anything else.

**Painting**: A performance improvement has been implemented wherein the checkerboard pattern is no longer regenerated on every draw. An option to create a custom-sized image has been added (this does not perform any checks, so enter large values at your own risk).

**GRUB**: The boot menu has had new options added for enabling the legacy ATA driver, which may allow limited hard disk access in environments where the default ATA DMA driver does not function (such as VMWare). Disable the ATA DMA driver if you are enabling the legacy ATA driver.

**Help Browser**: The help browser now uses a stack-based history, so you can move forward and backward multiple steps. A history menu has been added. The help browser also now supports files from arbitrary paths using the format `file:/path/to/document.trt`.

**Build Tools**: The `.gitignore` has been updated. The Makefile can now produce kernel header packages, for convenience.

**Menus**: The mouse can now be moved between menus in the menu bar when a menu is open. Formatted menu entries are now supported with the `rich=` option to `MenuEntryAction`.

## Release Notes

This update is focused on improvements to the audio mixer, but other fixes are also present.

**Mouse**: A fix for fast mouse movements seen in VirtualBox has been implemented - this should resolve some reported issues with VirtualBox when ""Mouse Integration"" is disabled.

**#pragma once**: System headers now use `#pragma once` instead of include guards.

**zlib source update**: The source for the `zlib` tarball has been updated. We are working to upgrade the version of zlib we use, but this should resolve issues with installing the toolchain for the time being.

**Kernel**: A minor optimization as been made in the `sbrk` system call. Patch provided by @Farseer2 

**Panel**: Additional panel widgets are available for future use in a new login manager. The panel window now provides the same API as other windows for handling mouse events, so it may be used with a standard mainloop.

**Audio**: Many improvements to the audio mixer have been added, including better support for audio from games (the Quake package has been updated to use these new APIs and audio support is no longer available from Quake in older releases of ToaruOS).

## Known Issues

We are investigating an issue where, under VirtualBox, time slows down while playing Quake, despite no apparent change in performance. The issue is not reproduced under QEMU. _A workaround for this issue has been implemented and will be available in the next update._

Thanks to feedback from 1.0, this is the first post-release bugfix update for ToaruOS.

**Keyboard/Mouse**: An issue with the PS/2 mouse driver interfering with the keyboard driver has been corrected. This bug had some pretty severe and visible side-effects including apparent loss of mouse input, jittery movement in Quake while walking, and many other more interesting things. Bug information submitted by @SirCmpwn 

**Toast Daemon**: An issue wherein the toast daemon was always using a high-precision timeout intended only for its animations has been corrected.

**fswait2**: A debug message in the `fswait2` system call was erroneously set to the `NOTICE` level and causing unnecessary log spam. It has been reduced to `INFO`.

**Tutorial**: A typographical error in the tutorial wizard has been corrected. Patch submitted by @adamdicarlo 

**Terminal**: A bug wherein the terminal's image support was not sending correct damage rects to the compositor has been corrected.

**TTY**: The TTY buffer size has been increased and some potential deadlocks when using a single thread to manage a PTY master have been addressed.

**README**: The screenshots in the readme have been updated to a set used in the 1.0 release notes.

ToaruOS is a complete hobby operating system, including a kernel and userspace with many graphical applications. This is the first release considered to be ""user-ready"", but please keep in mind that ToaruOS is a hobby project and it may not be stable or suitable for any purpose you might have for an operating system. This release represents the culmination of many years of development, research, and learning.

## History

This release has been six years in the making. The project started when I was still in university, studying computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Many of my classmates had decided to take ECE391 - a course offered by the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering which was primarily known for its final project: a basic multitasking operating system. I, however, was on track for an early graduation, and the course offered no credits for me, having already taken the CS department's ""equivalent"" (a systems engineering course, which I enjoyed immensely, but was definitely not about operating systems). Unable to take ECE391, I set off on my own to build an operating system that met its requirements.

ToaruOS has seen many contributions from other developers over its years. For a period of time while I was still in school, I had taken over management of UIUC's SIGOps student chapter with the goal of bringing in classmates to work on new features for the OS. From this came much of the underlying functionality of the GUI, including the shared memory subsystem. Other notable features contributed by others include much of the x86 assembly elements which were re-written in GAS from earlier YASM sources, the audio drivers and mixer, and much of the network stack.

As I returned to the software industry after my university years, ToaruOS became a weekend project. I went through many hiatuses over the past few years, and development has often been in spurts as something piques my interest. The months leading up to this release have been some of the most active for the OS, seeing the addition of a dynamic linker, upgrades to our GCC builds to 6.3 (which had been using 4.6, the version of GCC released in 2011 when the project was getting started), the growth of a Python userspace ecosystem, and much more.

Now, finally, it is time to tag ""v1.0.0"". Long ago, I had drafted a list of features I wanted to see in this release, and while many were considered ambitious, one by one, each box has been checked. But, of course, this is not the end, and I expect that I will make many more releases in this 1.x series, be they bug fixes or feature additions.

## Features of the OS

ToaruOS's kernel in its current form is 32-bit, non-SMP, monolithic (but modular), and Unix-like. It supports processes, threads, shared memory, files, pipes, TTYs, packet-based IPC, and basic IPv4 networking. Driver modules allow for access to EXT2 and ISO9660 filesystems, PATA and ATAPI disk access for hard drives and CDs, framebuffer support on most virtual machines (as well as bootloader-assisted generic framebuffer support), networking on AMD PCnet FAST, Realtek RTL8139, and Intel PRO/1000-series NICs, PS/2 mice and keyboards, audio on Intel AC'97 chipsets, as well as special support for VirtualBox's guest additions.

The userspace includes a dynamic linker, a full-featured compositing windowing system, many Unix-like utilities, a port of Python 3.6 (including many binding libraries for the ToaruOS windowing environment), and several graphical applications (including a package manager).

Several third-party software packages have been ported to the OS, including Vim, GCC and Binutils, MuPDF, SDL, Quake, Bochs, and more, available through the package manager.

## About the Name

Many people ask what ""ToaruOS"" means, where the name came from, and how to pronounce it. I will start by saying that the name is a reference to a series of light novels, manga, and anime, and that like the titles of those works, an acceptable translation of ""ToaruOS"" might be ""A Certain OS"". This name came about as a parody of the myriad generically-named hobby operating systems out there - many of them called things like ""My OS"". In the early days of development, ToaruOS was rather consistently referred to as とあるOS, and over time this changed to the romanized ToAruOS and later to ToaruOS simply because it was easier for people to read and write. The logo for the OS still bears the kana writing and is blatantly ripped from the logos of its namesakes. Following the Toaru theme, codenames for releases throughout development have come from characters from the series. As for how to pronounce it, here's a handy guide for English speakers: toe ah roo (oh ess).

## Building ToaruOS

Building ToaruOS from scratch can be tricky. The recommended build environment for ToaruOS is Ubuntu 16.04 or newer. Clone the repository and run the following commands:

```
make toolchain               # This will take several minutes (possibly up to 30, or more)
. toolchain/activate.sh      # Adds the toolchain binaries to $PATH
make                         # Builds the kernel, modules, and core userspace.
toolchain/install-python.sh  # Builds Python 3.6
toolchain/install-pycairo.sh # Builds PyCairo bindings to Cairo
make clean-disk; make        # Rebuilds the disk image with Python included.
```

You can run this development image with QEMU (`make run`) or VirtualBox (`make virtualbox`).

It is recommended that you also build a separate CD image. With your toolchain from the previous step activated, **clone the repository again** (to a different directory), and run:

```
toolchain/install-python.sh
toolchain/install-pycairo.sh
make cdrom
```

This will produce a `toaruos.iso`. You can run this image with `make run-cdrom` or with any supported environment.

## Running ToaruOS

While we do what we can to ensure compatibility with actual hardware, we focus our development efforts on running ToaruOS in virtual machines such as QEMU and VirtualBox. If you choose to run ToaruOS on ""bare metal"", we recommend using the live CD, which should also function as a bootable USB stick on some platforms. Please be aware of the hardware requirements of the OS, both when using ToaruOS with real hardware and when using virtual machines.

The preferred environments are as follows:
- **VirtualBox**:
  - **OS Type**: `Other/Unknown`
  - **Memory**: At least 1024MB
  - **Video Memory**: May need to be adjusted if you have a large display
- **QEMU**:
  - `qemu-system-i386 -M accel=kvm:tcg -m 1G -vga std -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user -soundhw ac97,pcspk -cdrom toaruos.iso`

If you are trying to run ToaruOS in Bochs, please set your clock to sync to realtime and be aware that the compositing window manager is somewhat demanding, so performance on Bochs (and other software emulators) may not provide a desirable experience.

The default user on both the CD and development hard disks is `local` with password `local`. You may also make use of the `root` user, with password `toor`, but a `sudo` implementation is available if you need to perform privileged tasks as a regular user.

### Netboot Image

Attached to this release is a 2MB CD ISO labeled ""netboot.iso"". This image can be used on platforms with supported network configurations to boot into a downloaded userspace obtained from our website or a mirror. It will not function in environments without network support.

### Hardware Compatibility / Drivers

#### Display
- **preset** - 32-bit linear framebuffer set up by bootloader
- **qemu** - Bochs/QEMU (and VirtualBox) virtual display device
- **vmware** - VMware virtual display device

(The display driver will automatically detect from the above list by default, so you should not need to worry about setting this unless you are crafting your own Grub configuration.)

#### Network
- **e1000** - Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
- **pcnet** - AMD PCnet-FAST II/III
- **rtl** - Realtek RTL 8139

(All of these drivers are available by default, and if a supported network card is detected the driver for it will be initialized automatically.)

#### Audio
- **ac97** - Intel ICH AC'97
- **pcspkr** - Basic beeper support

_We are working to support the Intel HD Audio chipset in the future._

#### Disk
- **ata** - ATAPI and (P)ATA with DMA support
- **ataold** - (P)ATA without DMA support

(If you are using ToaruOS on real hardware, you may need to try the `ataold` driver if you have issues with the `ata` driver, or disable the ATA drivers entirely if you are running from a live CD.)

#### File Systems
- **ext2** - Ext2 (basic write support is available, but may be unstable - detailed bug reports are appreciated)
- **iso9660** - Read support for CD filesystems

#### Keyboard/Mouse
- **ps2kbd** - PS/2 keyboard
- **ps2mouse** - PS/2 mouse (with scrollwheel and middle click)
- **vboxguest** - Provides support for the ""Mouse Integration"" feature of VirtualBox

## Things to Try

### Install Packages

If you are running ToaruOS in an environment where networking is supported (QEMU and VirtualBox as configured in the previous section), you may want to try installing packages through the Package Manager. You can use the package manager from the command line:

```
sudo get-py vim # for example, will install the text editor
```

... or through the graphical interface available from the ""Packages"" icon on the desktop. Package removal is not available at this time.

### Read Documentation

ToaruOS comes with a documentation viewer called Help Browser which provides rich-text documentation from some of the installed software.

### Explore the Terminal

ToaruOS provides a Unix-like environment with many command line utilities and a feature-rich terminal emulator. A relatively complete Python installation comes pre-installed on the live CDs. You can obtain additional applications, such as Vim or GCC, through the package manager.

### Play Games

ToaruOS comes pre-installed with some games such as `2048` and ""Mines"".

With the package manager, you can download additional games such as id Software's Doom and Quake (shareware versions). These games will be added to the Applications menu under the ""Games"" submenu. A Super Nintendo emulator (snes9x) is also available, but you'll need to obtain your own ROMs to use it.

## Community

### Contributing to ToaruOS

Please note that ToaruOS was started as a project for me to learn and build things on my own. As such, larger contributions are discouraged as I usually want to build things myself. However, smaller bug fixes, and independent software ports, are welcome.

### IRC

You can join us on Freenode (`chat.freenode.net`) in `#toaruos`.

## Future

There is a long list of goals for ToaruOS 2.0, including a new 64-bit, SMP-capable kernel. Many other changes are expected in the interim, including improvements to existing applications and possibly new device drivers.

5296777,2017-01-29T13:25:13Z,2017-01-29T13:43:04Z,v1.0.0 prelease (v0.99.27) - update Z,"ToaruOS is a hobby operating system for x86 PCs featuring a rich graphical interface, including both a kernel and userspace built mostly from scratch. This release is part of an ongoing development effort leading up to a 1.0 stable release.

## Release Notes

**Clock**: A new clock face is available, and a menu has been added to select between them.

**Terminal**: A bug in which scrolling an application like vim would leave cursor trails has been fixed. A bug causing scrollback to appear to redraw slowly has been fixed. The VGA terminal now supports a full range of Code Page 437 characters (through their Unicode equivalents). The VGA terminal no longer uses multiple threads.

**Kernel**: `fswait` support has been added to serial devices and sockets (experimental). A system function has been added to set the VGA text mode cursor position - it is not intended that this be seriously used, it exists primarily to ensure that the VGA terminal can hide the cursor by setting it off screen.

**procfs**: Process start times are now tracked and reported as the creation and modification times for `procfs` entries.

**kdebug**: The serial console is now disabled unless `kdebug` is passed as a kernel argument. You can still access the debug console through a userspace terminal with the `kdebug` command. A `cat` command has been added. `ls` now supports an argument.

**Panel**: The panel no longer calls `sh` when executing applications, instead using Python's `shlex` to understand argument quoting. As a side effect, this means that support for environment variables in application shortcuts has been removed - we hope to add this functionality back in the future.

**ld.so**: A crash when attempting to load a non-existent library with `dlopen` has been fixed and many new `dlerror` messages have been added.

**Net**: The network kernel tasklet is now started by the network module when a network card is initialized, rather than by the card drivers themselves. The tasklet has been renamed `[net]`.

**pstree**: `pstree` now reports the names of Python scripts.

## Known Issues

There are no specific known issues with this release.

## Usage

VirtualBox is the recommended environment for running ToaruOS. QEMU is also supported. Using ToaruOS on real hardware is not recommended and we are not responsible for any issues you may encounter or damage this may cause. Other virtual machines and emulators are not supported and may not work. It is not recommended that you run ToaruOS in Bochs as the UI requires considerably higher performance than Bochs is capable of providing. When using QEMU, KVM is preferred but acceptable performance should be possible with the non-accelerated TCG backend on modern hardware.

It was a workaround for missing timeouts - use `fswait2` instead. See the panel for a demonstration. Several bugs have been fixed, including the crash mentioned in the previous release and some issues with the nested compositor.

**Mines**: A bug in widget routing that made clicks not go to the right buttons has been fixed.

**Text Input**: The text input dialog has had ""Okay"" and ""Cancel"" buttons added, so it looks more like a proper dialog box. Additionally, this module has been made into a library so it can be more easily imported from applications not installed in `/bin`.

**Kernel**: Improvements have been made to the handling of timeouts in `fswait2`. A new system function has been added to replace the `cmdline` for a running thread - it can be used to add descriptive names to threads.

**Clock**: A new Python implementation of the clock app has been added.

**Fonts**: The Python font library can now provide a Cairo font face from the currently selected Freetype font.

**Toasts**: The toast notification daemon has been ported to Python and now supports rich text.

**Kernel**: A bug with process cleanup has been identified wherein a process could attempt to awaken its zombie parent after it had released its scheduling resources, causing either the process itself to crash or the entire kernel, depending on other factors. This has been fixed. A few other kernel bugfixes have been implemented.

**Help Browser**: The Help Browser now supports loading ""Toaru Rich Text"" documents from the Internet. Please note that Help Browser is not a web browser. This functionality has been added to ease the viewing of release notes for OS updates and is not meant to be used as a replacement for a web browser.

**Update Checker**: A tool to check for updates has been added. It will run automatically at the start of the live CD wizard. When v0.99.24 is released, you will receive a notification on startup. If you are running the netboot image, an update notification is an indicator that you should download a new image as the kernel has changed.

**Dialogs**: The cancel button is now configurable, so it can be disabled or replaced with a different label. You can now configure whether closing the dialog is considered canceling it.

**/proc/meminfo**: Information on the size of the kernel heap has been added to `/proc/meminfo`. This information was helpful in resolving the memory leak above.

**procfs**: `/proc/self` is now available. Note that due to the way paths and files work in ToaruOS, it may not act the same way as it would on Linux - expect references to it to _always_ return the process doing the querying, even if you've `cd`'d into the directory.

**tmpfs**: Block data is now stored at specially-allocated pages, independently from the heap. This reduces tmpfs overhead and means that tmpfses no longer wreak havoc on the kernel's virtual address space. You should be able to give a VM multiple GBs of RAM and actually take advantage of it as filesystem space. This should also reduce the memory overhead of the netboot image significantly (it is roughly on par with the normal ISO).

**Python**: A missing `free` for Yutani messages has been added to the Python bindings. Long-running Python Yutani apps should no longer leak memory from their server polling.

**Panel**: A network status widget has been added to the panel. The clock and date widgets now show a calendar popover. The volume widget now periodically updates to account for potential knob changes in other applications.

**Alt-F4**: Alt-F4 support has been fixed after being broken when applications moved to a generic mainloop implementation.

**Network**: The `e1000` driver is now functioning, and bugfixes have been introduced for the `pcnet` and `rtl` drivers that should fix issues using them with QEMU's TCG backend and other slow systems.

**Netboot**: The netboot image has been updated. Please download a new ISO below if you are using netboot. You can now use the netboot image on systems with supported Intel PRO/1000 series cards.

**Wallpaper Selection**: The wallpaper selector has been rewritten in Python with an improved UI.

**Drawing**: The ""Draw!"" application has been replaced with ""ToaruPaint"", which is written in Python and features a very functional color picker tool that I spent far too much time on.

**TTK**: The early, incomplete C implementation of the Toaru ToolKit has been removed. In the future, we will expand the Python implementation, but it is already more complete and useful than the C version ever was. A few applications had to be ported to Python for this to happen, but those Python ports include many usability and feature improvements, so it was worthwhile in the end.

Additionally, there are some bug fixes in this release. There is no kernel update necessary for this release; please use the netboot image from the previous release if you are net booting.

**Kernel**: `fswait` support has been added to Unix pipes.

**Toolchain**: The `fswait` and `fswait2` system call functions are now available from the C library (as `syscall_fswait` and `syscall_fswait2`). Vim and other applications have been updated to account for this change.

**Python Bindings**: Bindings have been added for the `fswait` API and changes have been made to the Yutani bindings to allow interfacing with the `fswait` function.

**Fetch**: A new machine readable output format for progress information has been added.

**Desktop and UI**: A new progress bar applet is available which can be used with the `fetch` tool. Two new icons have been added to the desktop: Documents (opens `$HOME` in the file browser) and Packages (opens the package manager GUI).

**Package Manager**: The package manager's functionality has been moved to a library and a new GUI package installer has been added.

**Security**: A new graphical `sudo` has been added (`gsudo`). Note that it is just as insecure as the original `sudo`: ToaruOS makes no claims of security.

**Emoji**: Graphical emoji support has been added to the `TextRegion` library (and thus applications which make use of it). Emoji images must be installed to `/usr/share/emoji` for this functionality to be available - you can obtain the EmojiOne set through the `emojione` package available in the package manager.

**Documentation**: Several packages have had documentation (including license information) added since the last release.

**Icons and Menus**: Packages can now specify new menu entries (and icons) to install. Vim has been removed from the Accessories menu (it will be re-added if you install the `vim` package; if you are using a hard disk build, note that your copy of Vim should continue to work, it just won't show up in the menu).

**File Browser**: The file browser will now open PDF files with the PDF viewer if it is installed (package `pdfviewer`).

**NOTE**: There are toolchain updates and kernel changes in this release - if you are building from source and have an older checkout, you will need to rebuild newlib (and should also rebuild vim to help verify we didn't break it). If you are using a netboot image, please update.

## Known Issues

The Package Manager GUI is still quite rough. Improvements are planned.

Alt+F1 is now bound to open the application menu on the panel. A menu bar has been added to the Help Browser and replaces the embedded navigation links. The File Browser is now available. The About Applet is now usable from other applications through command line arguments to set the title, text, and icons. Some bugs in the compositor and panel have been fixed. The Yutani Python bindings now support window move events.

Several userspace applications have been rewritten to employ this new functionality, including the compositor, terminal, and toast notification daemon - the last two now run in a single thread. A port of GCC 6.3 is now available natively through the package manager: type `sudo get-py build-essential` to install gcc, binutils, and headers. Headers are not yet provided for the ToaruOS system libraries, but you should be able to retrieve them from your local installation if desired. Additionally, improvements have been made to the included Python libraries, kernel bugs have been fixed, and UI improvements have been made to the package manager and `fetch` applications.

If you have been using netboot ISOs, you will need to upgrade your ISO to receive these kernel updates or your netboot image will no longer function. If you are running the netboot ISO directly from the ToaruOS.org URL using, for example, qemu's cURL functionality, you do not need to take any action - the netboot image on the server has been updated.

## Known Issues

`cross-gcc` is not available in the source repos, but we can confirm that a manual build should function.

While not necessarily an issue, the GCC package is quite large, and as packages are kept in memory you will need quite a bit to comfortably run a system with the package installed. As such, we are increasing the recommended VM RAM to 1GB.

## Usage

VirtualBox is the recommended environment for running ToaruOS. QEMU is also supported. Using ToaruOS on real hardware is not recommended and we are not responsible for any issues you may encounter or damage this may cause. Other virtual machines and emulators are not supported and may not work. It is not recommended that you run ToaruOS in Bochs as the UI requires considerably higher performance than Bochs is capable of providing. When using QEMU, KVM is preferred but acceptable performance should be possible with the non-accelerated TCG backend on modern hardware.

A new feature has been implemented in the compositor where clients can request a periodic timer signal to work around a lack of `select` / general timeout support in the IO layers - some applications which previously used a timer thread have been moved to this API (this change was implemented primarily to ease the development of Python Yutani clients, where threading is not yet a valid workaround for the underlying issue). The terminal now supports scrolling with the mouse wheel. The `python-demos` package has been merged into the core repository and now ships by default.

This build is part of an ongoing effort to support a new set of core UI applications written in Python. We are actively working to port the panel and wallpaper applications and to provide a general UI toolkit for building rich graphical applications.

The netboot ISO remains unchanged in this release. If you already have a netboot ISO, it should now provide 0.99.8 userspace.

## Known Issues

`gross-gcc` continues to be unavailable. We're working on it.

At least one of the Python demos now shipping by default depends on `python-cairo`, which is not installed on the CD. You can install it with `sudo get-py python-cairo`.

![array of screenshots from github readme](http://i.imgur.com/fqD3WRv.png)

ToaruOS is a hobby operating system, including a kernel, drivers, and userspace applications. Started in early 2011, ToaruOS has been in development now for six years, and we are finally ready for our first true production release. While we do not believe that ToaruOS is stable or feature-complete enough to be used for everday computing needs, we do think that this release represents a sufficient feature set to perform many common desktop tasks. ToaruOS features a compositing window manager, a terminal emulator with considerable xterm emulation and some features of its own, basic network support, dynamic libraries, loadable kernel modules, and much more. The kernel and drivers are built entirely in-house, while the userspace is mostly in-house applications built on top of a handful of third-party, open-source libraries such as Cairo. 

## Using ToaruOS

The preferred method of deploying ToaruOS is as a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) VM. You may use the attached ISO as a CD in a new VM using the ""Other/Unknown"" OS type. It is recommended that you provide your VM with 1GB of RAM. The default settings for the ""Other/Unknown"" configuration should provide your VM with the needed hardware to support networking and audio.

If you would prefer to use QEMU, please make use of the following command line arguments:

```
qemu-system-i386 -vga std -m 512 -cdrom toaruos.iso -soundhw ac97 \
    -net user -net nic,model=rtl8139  -enable-kvm # KVM is optional but recommended
```

Attempting to install ToaruOS on real hardware is not recommended as driver support, even in this official release, is lacking. We are not responsible for any damage caused by attempts to use ToaruOS on real hardware.

You may also download the source archive for ToaruOS and build it, as per [the instructions on our wiki](https://github.com/klange/toaruos/wiki/Testing-and-Building). Building ToaruOS from source will take some time and requires your host environment to be sufficiently similar to the ones we use, but will afford you the opportunity to easily add extra functionality such as a complete GCC/Binutils toolchain natively within the OS.

## Release Notes

This is an **experimental** pre-release of what will eventually become ToaruOS 1.0. Over the last release, the major improvement in this release is the dynamic userspace and linker. Additionally, several improvements to networking, support for ISO 9660 filesystems and ATAPI CD drives, expanded live CD tutorials, a new GRUB theme, new wallpapers, window management improvements, tab completion in the shell, and more are included.

There is still more work to be done before an official 1.0 release can be drafted, but this build represents something much closer to that target than to the previous release.

4046537,2016-09-04T04:55:43Z,2016-09-04T05:05:20Z,v0.14.1 - VirtualBox Networking,"This is a point release improvement over v0.14.0 adding support for networking in VirtualBox through a driver for the AMD PCNet series NIC. As with existing network support, this is **experimental** and **incomplete**, but should offer the same functionality as what is provided for the RTL8139 card used with QEMU. The drivers have been tested under both VirtualBox and QEMU (which also supports the PCNet series).

Additional improvements in this point release over v0.14.0 include:
- An experimental wallpaper switcher app. This is not available in the normal CD build.
- An option to build larger CDs, which include all the default wallpapers as well as the switcher and may contain other additional features over the smaller CDs in the future. Note that more RAM is required to use these images as they include larger ramdisks.
- Improvements to Yutani to correct issues with resizing rotated windows and to add the ability to rotate a window with the mouse rather than the keyboard (Alt + Right Click).
- Various bug fixes.

Please see [the release notes for v0.14.0](https://github.com/klange/toaruos/releases/tag/v0.14.0) for additional information on this release as it relates to previous releases.

Notable changes are marked in **bold**.
- CMOS accuracy has been improved.
- Terminfo descriptors are now included on CDs.
- The IRC client has been improved.
- Non-DMA ATA drivers have been restored.
- Basic VMware SVGA modesetting is now supported.
- Support for **VirtualBox Guest Additions** (auto-resize and mouse integration) has been added.
- **Yutani can now handle display size changes.**
- A new module has been added to set display resolution from `kdebug` on supported devices.
- `debug_shell.ko` is now included in the boot module list for CDs allowing access to `kdebug`.
- An `auto` option has been added to the LFB video driver. It will automatically detect QEMU/Bochs/VirtualBox and VMWare or fall back to the ""present"" driver. This is now the default on CDs.

# Codename

The codename for this release is **Kuroko**.

# Instructions

You may download the source archive and build it as you normally would following the instructions in the README, or you may download the ISO image and use it with a virtual machine or burn it to an actual CD. Note that hardware support in ToaruOS continues to be limited and it may not work with your PC. If you experience issues, please join our IRC channel (`#toaruos`) on Freenode for assistance.

## QEMU

For the best access to ToaruOS's features, run QEMU as follows:

```
qemu-system-i386 -vga std -m 512 -cdrom toaruos.iso \
-enable-kvm -soundhw ac97 -net user -net nic,model=rtl8139
```

## VirtualBox

Support for VirtualBox has improved in this release. For best results, configure your VM with 512MB of RAM and use the default settings for other options and then use the ISO release as a CD. Network support on VirtualBox is not yet available, but a PCNet driver is in the works, so please check back later.

# Notice

This release is not being marked as ""pre-release"" on github, but please remember that ToaruOS is a hobby project and not in any way designed or intended for use on production systems.

1525934,2015-07-12T10:40:47Z,2015-07-12T10:48:08Z,0.11.1 Live CD,"This is the first official Live CD release of とあるOS.

This is a pre-release demo: there are still many unimplemented features in とあるOS. We appreciate well-researched bug reports, but be mindful of the myriad known issues and limitations with this release. The Live CD requires at least 256MB of RAM and a display setup that supports a 1024x768x32bpp mode through VBE (if you're using QEMU, that means you'll need ""-vga std""). No permanent installation methods are offered at this time. The Live CD has been tested under QEMU and VirtualBox, but other emulators should work. If you wish to use the live CD on real hardware, you will need a PS/2 keyboard and mouse (or compatible configuration) - be aware that we have not had the opportunity to test とあるOS on a wide variety of hardware.

とあるOS contains some third-party software.
