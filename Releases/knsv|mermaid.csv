- Adjustment of init method for more fine grained integrations

## Info regarding the change of the init method

 Configuration are picked up from the mermaid object and is not passed as arguments. Same handling for all diagram types, sequenceDiagrams were handled in a different way before this commit.

When init is called with:
- 0 arguments - all mermaid divs are processed
- 1 argument - this is interpreted as a definition of what nodes to process
- 2 arguments - for (some) backwards compatability the second argument is interpreted as the definition of nodes to process. The first argument (prrobably a sequence config is ignored)

A definition of nodes to process can be
- a css selector for what elements to be processed
- a list of nodes as in the result of a command like the one below

```
document.querySelectorAll('.tbProcessed');
```
