8228896,2017-10-23T20:35:37Z,2017-10-23T22:13:37Z,Helm v2.7.0 - Halloween Edition,"Boo! Happy Halloween from the Helm team! 👻 🎃 🕷

Helm 2.7.0 is a feature release. Similar to Helm 2.6.0, we have focused on stability and reliability in this release, limiting our enhancements to things that improve the reliability of Helm in production.

This version of Helm is compiled against Kubernetes 1.8. There are also additional features like `--node-selectors` and `--output` flags to `helm init` as well as a new secrets storage backend (in beta)!

The community keeps growing, and we'd love to see you there.

## Installation and Upgrading

Download Helm 2.7. The common platform binaries are here:

- [OSX](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.7.0-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.7.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.7.0-windows-amd64.tar.gz)

Once you have the client installed, upgrade Tiller with `helm init --upgrade`.

The [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart-guide) will get you going from there. For **upgrade instructions** or detailed installation notes, check the [install guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm). You can also use a [script to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get) on any system with `bash`.

## What's Next

- 2.7.1 will contain only bug fixes.
- 2.8.0 is the next feature release. While it is likely to have some notable features, we will continue to prioritize stability and reliability over major feature additions. It will likely land shortly after Kubernetes 1.9 has landed on December 13th.

This is Helm's very first release candidate, and it is to help gather feedback from the community as well as give users a chance to test Helm in staging environments before v2.7.0 is officially released.

The official changelog will come out with the v2.7.0 release. For now, you can see the commit changes [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/compare/v2.6.2...v2.7.0-rc1).

It is also important to note that this patch release removes a few features from Helm due to licensing issues, most notably #1639 and #2449. These new features relied on libraries licensed under [Facebook's BSD+Patents license](https://code.facebook.com/pages/850928938376556) (also known as a [Category-X license](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x)). The Facebook BSD+Patents license includes a specification of a PATENTS file that passes along some risk to users of the Helm project. The terms of Facebook BSD+Patents license are not a subset of those found in Apache v2, and therefore cannot be sublicensed as Apache v2 libraries. We are very sorry for breaking [our policy on semantic versioning](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#semver), but in this specific case it is to protect the interests of all users of the Helm project.

we have agreed to wait upon upstream Kubernetes for a solution to the authentication
problem. This item has thus been removed from the 2.6 and 2.7 roadmap.

- The deadlock problem with Tiller has been found and fixed. A huge thanks to the dozen community members who submitted use cases and data to help us find the problem.
- The `helm get manifest` and `helm get value` commands are now working properly.
- Plugins will now receive the correct value for `$HELM_HOME` regardless of how the home directory was set.

_Helm v2.5.1 is tested on Kubernetes 1.5-1.7. However, the latest Kubernetes 1.7 features (e.g. custom type definitions) are not supported in this release. Full Kubernetes 1.7 support is coming in Helm 2.6._

Our community is one of the fastest growing Kubernetes projects. We'd love to have you as a part!

## Installation and Upgrading

Download Helm 2.5.1. The common platform binaries are here:

- [OSX](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.5.1-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.5.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.5.1-windows-amd64.zip)

Once you have the client installed, upgrade Tiller with `helm init --upgrade`.

The [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart-guide) will get you going from there. For **upgrade instructions** or detailed installation notes, check the [install guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm). You can also use a [script to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get) on any system with `bash`.

## Breaking Changes

In this release, we fixed a bug that caused extra empty fields to be added to a `requirements.yaml` file. As a result, in some cases this fix will result in a regeneration of the requirements lock file. This is not technically a breaking change, but may result in surprising behavior.

## What's Next

- 2.6.0 is the next feature release. It is nearing completion.

6765283,2017-06-19T20:43:59Z,2017-06-19T23:36:12Z,Helm 2.5.0 Is Available,"We are happy to announce Helm 2.5.0. This is a feature release, though it also includes many bug fixes. We strongly recommend upgrading.

The big news for Helm 2.5: We have a new documentation website! We know reading markdown in GitHub is not the best. So we have expanded the Helm.sh website to include a new [documentation section](http://docs.helm.sh).

Our latest feature for 2.5.0 is exciting even though it is still experimental: We have added experimental support for Tiller back-end plugins. Tiller plugins are created as gRPC servers that implement a gRPC interface. This feature is not enabled by default. Tiller must be started with `--experimental-release` to enable the feature.

The community keeps growing, and we'd love to see you there.

## Installation and Upgrading

Download Helm 2.5. The common platform binaries are here:

- [OSX](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.5.0-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.5.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.5.0-windows-amd64.zip)

Once you have the client installed, upgrade Tiller with `helm init --upgrade`.

_Note:_ On Kubernetes 1.6, you will need to decide how to configure your RBACs for Tiller.

The [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart-guide) will get you going from there. For **upgrade instructions** or detailed installation notes, check the [install guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm). You can also use a [script to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get) on any system with `bash`.

## New Features

In addition to Tiller plugins, the following notable features have landed for 2.5.0:

- The `--set` syntax now accepts array indices: `--set servers[0].port=8080`
- The `-u` flag to `helm package` updates dependencies when packaging
- A new `helm plugin update` command has been added for updating plugins
- Packages can be aliased in `requirements.yaml` (experimental)
- Upgrading Tiller's service account is now possible via `helm init`
- A `--repo` flag has been added to install, update, and other applicable subcommands.

## Breaking Changes

Helm has strict guidelines about breaking changes, and we do our best to minimize the impact of such changes. But on occasion, we  choose to change things that may cause breakages.

In this release, the following changes may cause breakages:

- `helm install` and `helm update` no longer download remote charts to the current working directroy. `helm fetch` continues to work as it always has.
- Since `--set` now accepts array indices, `values.yaml` keys of the (literal) form `""foo[0]""` will no longer work.
- A new field, `Force`, was added to the `UpdateReleaseRequest` and `RollbackReleaseRequset` gRPC calls. This will not break existing gRPC clients, but could break forks of Tiller that override existing gRPC calls.

*Note:* Features marked _experimental_ may undergo major changes. These features are exempted from the usual breaking change restrictions.

## What's Next

- 2.5.1 will be the first patch release in the 2.5 tree. It will contain _only_ bug fixes.
- 2.6.0 is the next feature release. It is planned to be compatible with Kubernetes 1.7.

Notable changes include:

- Fix for the `--wait` flag
- Failed runs of `helm test` return non-zero codes
- And a `--devel` flag on fetch, install, and upgrade now installs unstable chart versions

The last item is to provide a convenience for installing charts whose versions indicate that the chart is unstable (e.g. `foo-1.2.3-alpha.1`). A change to Helm 2.4.0 caused `helm install` to never automatically install an unstable version. This behavior can be overridden with `--devel`.

Once you have the client installed, upgrade Tiller with `helm init --upgrade`.

_Note:_ On Kubernetes 1.6, you will need to decide how to configure your RBACs for Tiller.

The [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) will get you going from there. For **upgrade instructions** or detailed installation notes, check the [install guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md). You can also use a [script to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get) on any system with `bash`.

## What's Next?
- Helm 2.4.3 will be our next patch release.
- Helm 2.5.0 is the next major release.

The [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) will get you going from there. For **upgrade instructions** or detailed installation notes, check the [install guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md). You can also use a [script to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get) on any system with `bash`.

## Kubernetes 1.6 Native!

This version of Helm is compiled against Kubernetes 1.6. This means that all of the 1.6 features are officially supported.

Since `kubeadm` recently enabled RBAC by default, we have also made it easy to set a Service Account on your Tiller server during installation:

```console
$ helm init --service-account=SOME_NAME
```

Note that if you are an RBAC user, you will still need to configure your service account and rules.

**If you are running Kubernetes 1.6, you should upgrade to Helm 2.4**.

## Plugins, Phase 3 (of 5)

In Helm 2.1 we introduced client-side plugins. In Helm 2.3.0 we introduced the new plugin manager. Now, in 2.4 we are introducing protocol hooks. This is the first implementation of a design pattern that allows developers to hook into Helm's runtime.

In this case, a _protocol handler_ can declare a protocol (like `s3`) to Helm. Any time Helm encounters an a matching protocol request (`s3://foo/bar`), it will execute the plugin.

All of this is done by adding a `downloaders` section to your `plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
name: ""testgetter""
version: ""0.1.0""
# ...
downloaders:
- command: ""$HELM_PLUGIN_DIR/get.sh""
  protocols:
    - ""test""  # handles test:// URLs
```

Where it makes sense, we will be adding new lifecycle hooks to the client-side plugin system.

Still to come:

- Server-side plugins are on their way.
- In-place plugin upgrading will arrive (probably) this summer.

## Breaking Changes

Several important Helm/Tiller subsystems changed with this release. While none of these changes violated our guidelines on breaking changes, we like to call out things that could be important to users of Helm and Helm's internal libraries.

### Usage Changes

- Template execution will now fail if an `include` template function cannot find the file it was trying to include. This is now consistent with `template`.
- When a `requirements.yaml` file has a dependency not found in `charts/`, `helm install` and `helm update` will fail with an error (instead of printing a warning).

### Developer Changes
- We upgraded to gRPC 1.2 for security reasons. This changes the generated `.pb.go` files.
- Moving to Kubernetes 1.6 means we had to add some extra build steps to `make bootstrap`. You cannot currently simply `glide install`. On rare occasions, rebuilding from source may first require deleting your `vendor/` folder and then running `make bootstrap`.
- The TLS client auth policy introduced in 2.3 has improved.
- The `local-cluster` script for starting a development Kubernetes instance has been removed.

## Other Features

After 2.3's massive new feature set, we focused our 2.4 energy on stability. But we still managed to squeeze in some exciting little additions.

- New Helm template function: `merge` (with Sprig 2.11.0)
- Now we have zsh completion!!! Use `helm completion zsh` for zsh and `helm completion bash` for bash.
- New locking on release objects has been introduced.
- The `get` script for installing Helm has been improved
- Add `--net-host` to init
- Change your default repository on init
- Add Prometheus hooks for monitoring Tiller
- Simplify testing with canary images
- Charts can now have version constraint checks

These and many other fixes and updates are listed below.

## What's Next?
- Helm 2.4.1 will be our next patch release.
- Helm 2.5.0 is the next major release. While 2.4's development cycle was accelerated to accommodate Kubernetes 1.6, we will be returning to our regular pace with 2.5.

## Install! Upgrade!

Download Helm 2.3. The common platform binaries are here:

- [Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.3.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.3.0-windows-amd64.zip)

Once you have the client installed, upgrade Tiller with `helm init --upgrade`.

_Note:_ On Kubernetes 1.6, you will need to decide how to configure your RBACs for Tiller.

The [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) will get you going from there.

You can also use a [script to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get) on any system with `bash`.

## Introducing the Helm Plugin Manager

We introduced Helm plugins in 2.1.0. And now we're bringing plugins to a new level with the Helm Plugin Manager. Installing plugins is now as easy as this:

```console
$ helm plugin install https://github.com/adamreese/helm-last
```

The above will install the `helm last` plugin directly from GitHub. You can view your plugins with `helm plugin list` and remove plugins with `helm plugin remove`.

Plugin developers get a few new goodies, too, including a workflow for local development and a hook system for running special commands on install and delete. We're creating a [list of Helm plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/related.md) to help the community find useful extensions.

## A Garden of New Template Functions

We've been hard at work making the Chart template system more powerful.

- There is now a `required` template function for marking a parameter as required.
- Along with `toYaml` and `toJson`, we also have a `toToml` conversion function. ConfigMap generation just got a lot easier.
- Sprig (our template function library) has dozens of new functions, many for improving flow control. And the library has [new documentation](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) too.

## Hoisting Values from Child Charts to Parent Charts

It is now possible to hoist values from a child chart to its parent. Building on 2.2.0's changes to `requirements.yaml`, Helm 2.3 allows chart developers to specify child values that should be extracted from the child chart and inserted into the parent.

This makes it possible to share variables upward without surprises. Check out the [docs for this new feature](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md#importing-child-values-via-requirementsyaml).

## And More TLS!

In Helm 2.2, we made it possible to use TLS to secure your chart repositories. With 2.3 we now support TLS encryption between `helm` and `tiller` (vai SSL gRPC). To get started with this, run `helm init --help` and take a look at the new TLS flags.

## Other Features Have Sprung Up

We've included many more features in Helm.

- Hooks can now be ""weighted"", giving chart authors the ability to run hooks in order
- The `--reuse-values` flag makes it possible to run a `helm upgrade` and re-use the old values
- Two new fields have been added to Chart.yaml: `appVersion` for specifying the version of an application that a chart provides, and `deprecated` to indicate that a chart is no longer maintained.
- A `--skip-refresh` flag has been added to `helm repo` and `helm init` to prevent Helm from re-fetching repository index files.
- The plugin system can be disabled via environment variable.
- `helm serve` now has a `--url` parameter for specifying a base URL.

Pile on a few dozen bug fixes and documentation changes, and you'll see how our always growing community has been hard at work.

## What's Next?
- Patch releases will begin with Helm 2.3.1, focused on bug fixes and documentation changes.
- Helm 2.4.0 is the next major release. The planned major features are:
	- Migration to the Kuberenetes 1.6 library
	- New Tiller-side plugins (called Rudders)
	- Helm Authentication
	- Protocol hooks for Helm plugins

There were two major issues resolved in this release:
- The `--wait --recreate-pods` flags now works properly. #2006
- The incompatibility with a `repositories.yaml` file created with older Helm versions has been fixed. #1974

Additionally, a minor change was made to the new `helm test` feature, and we updated to the latest Kubernetes libraries.

Thank you for your continued involvement in the community.

5456962,2017-02-14T19:59:02Z,2017-02-14T20:48:52Z,2.2.0: A Valentine Full of Features,"💝  This Valentine's day, the Kubernetes Helm team would like to show some love with the newly minted Helm 2.2.0 release. 💝 

We've got a lot of reasons to love the community:
- Taylor Thomas (Intel) joined the Helm core team. He has already made a profound impact on Helm's velocity.
- The Kubernetes Charts team has grown the stable repository to over 50 charts. Thanks to your contributions, that number is growing all the time.
- Helm [graduated from the Kubernetes Incubator process](https://deis.com/blog/2017/graduation-day-for-helm/), and is now a full-fledged Kubernetes project. It is an honor to be the first project to graduate. We think Kubernetes Charts may very well be the next graduate.
- The community has astonished and impressed us with a record number of pull requests. Over 40 individuals contributed at least one PR to the 2.2.0 release.

And we'd like you to be part of our community:
- Join the discussion in [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/): `#helm` 
- Hang out at the Public Developer Call: Thursday, 9:30 Pacific via [Zoom](https://engineyard.zoom.us/j/366425549)
- Test, debug, and contribute charts: [GitHub/kubernetes/charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts)

## Will You Be Mine? 💌

Upgrading just got easier. With this release of Helm, you can easily upgrade Tiller with `helm init --upgrade`.

Grab a Helm binary and get started.
- [OSX](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.2.0-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.2.0-windows-amd64.zip)

The [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) will get you going from there. For **upgrade instructions** or detailed installation notes, check the [install guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md). You can also use a [script to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get) on any system with `bash`.

## We Love Tests 😻

The headline feature of Helm 2.2.0 is its ability to run tests on a newly deployed chart. Chart authors can now create a suite of tests to verify that their chart is behaving as expected. We're excited about this tool because it meets one of our core objects: Make stability and reliability a hallmark of Kubernetes charts.

This feature comes with a new `helm test` command. Check out the [new docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/chart_tests.md) to learn more about testing your charts.

## Wooing Third Party Resources 💟

The Third Party Resources (TPR) system in Kubernetes has gone through many changes. The Helm team loves the TPR system like a kitten loves her favorite toy.

![Cat Snuggle](http://data.whicdn.com/images/24163575/original.jpg)
[source](http://weheartit.com/entry/24163575)

(We're tracking the analytics to see if kitten pictures cause people to read release notes.)

And so we are thrilled to announce that Helm 2.2 can now create _and upgrade_ resource types declared as Third Party Resources.

## Securing Chart Repositories with Sweet, Sweet TLS 💓

In addition to simple Basic auth, the Helm client can now use strong client SSL/TLS certificates to authenticate to a chart repository.

This new feature extends the chart repository file structure to allow embedding SSL certificates.

## Share the Love :heart:

We've included many more features in Helm.
- Helm now has a `--wait` flag on install and upgrade to wait until your whole chart is running
- `helm list` now has a `--namespace` flag to filter by namespace
- The `repositories.yaml` file can now reference local paths, a big boon for CI/CD systems
- Parent ""umbrella"" charts can now strategically enable and disable subcharts using the new [conditions and flags](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md#tags-and-condition-fields-in-requirementsyaml) system.
- Helm can uninstall Tiller with `helm reset`
- Charts are now validated before being sent to Kubernetes, which means faster error detection and fewer broken installs
- And for chart developers:
  - Added `.Release.Revision`, `.Release.IsUpgrade` and `.Release.IsInstall`
  - Added `.Capabilities` for learning about [the capabilities](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects.md#built-in-objects) of the Kubernetes cluster
  - Added `fromYAML` function
  - Update to the latest Sprig release

And this is just the short list! In all, over 152 patches were merged into this release.

## Sometimes Love Hurts 💔

Not all of the news is rosy. Helm maintains a strong commitment to backward compatibility. All of our changes to protocols and formats are backward compatible from Helm 2.0 until Helm 3.0. No features, flags, or commands are removed or substantially modified (other than bug fixes). And all of this is true of Helm 2.2.0.

We also try very hard to not change publicly accessible Go library definitions inside of the `pkg/` directory of our source code. However, due to a multitude of changes, **we have made a significant revision to the APIs inside of `pkg/kube`** (the part that contacts Kubernetes).

While the changes we made were much needed, we recognize that some of you may use these parts of Helm as libraries for your own application. We apologize for the inconvenience. And once again, we would like to reiterate that we do our best to avoid changes that would impact Go API users.

For a quick summary of our backward compatibility guidelines for releases between 2.0 and 3.0:
- Protobuf and gRPC changes MUST be backward compatible.
- Command line commands, flags, and arguments MUST be backward compatible
- File formats (such as Chart.yaml, repositories.yaml, and requirements.yaml) MUST be backward compatible
- Any chart that worked on a previous version of Helm MUST work on a new version of Helm (barring the cases where (a) Kubernetes itself changed, and (b) the chart worked because it exploited a bug)
- Chart repository functionality MUST be backward compatible
- Go libraries inside of `pkg/` SHOULD remain backward compatible (though code inside of `cmd/` may be changed from release to release without notice).

## What's Next? 😍
- Patch releases will begin with Helm 2.2.1, and will be released as needed. These will contain only bug fixes and security fixes.
- Helm 2.3.0 is the next feature release. Our big goals for 2.3.0 include a plugin manager for Helm plugins and a substantial overhaul of Helm and Tiller's AuthN/AuthZ story.

We fixed a few more bugs and bumped up the version of Sprig, and decided to cut one more release.

The Helm Core Team would like to wish you all a happy holidays. Our team is made up of many people from several organizations, but for the holiday season we are going to collectively take a holiday to spend time with our friends, loved ones, and other pet GitHub projects. 🎉 

We will resume our regular meetings the first week of January. Slack, as always, is open for ongoing conversation, though core contributors will be offline from December 23 to January 3. We look forward in seeing you all again in 2017!

## Notable Changes Since 2.1.2
- Fix for Deis Workflow installation (we accidentally changed an assumption about the contents of a default values. It's fixed now.).
- Update Sprig to 2.8.0
- `helm install` and `helm upgrade` both have improvements to their `--debug` output to help you figure out the real state of your release.
- A bug in namespace detection has been fixed

Version 2.1.3 is compatible with other 2.1 releases.

As we close out the 2016 year, we want to again take the opportunity to thank the nearly 100 people who have contributed code to Helm and to the Charts repo. We hope that with your collaboration, we can continue to craft a tool that is broadly useful to the Kubernetes community.

- Test, debug, and contribute charts: [GitHub/kubernetes/charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts)

## Notable Changes Since 2.0.2
- Kubernetes 1.5 support is included. Kubernetes 1.4 is still supported.
- Helm charts can now annotate resources that should _not_ be deleted on `helm delete`.
- Extend the Helm client behavior with Helm Plugins. You don't even have to know Go. Write them in whatever language you like.
- Generate ConfigMaps and Secrets more easily with the improved `{{ .Files }}` object.
- Use SemVer 2 ranges in `requirements.yaml`
- And finally, get better error messages when chart errors occur.

Version 2.1.0 is not ensured to be compatible with 2.0.2. We strongly recommend upgrading both client and server components.

## What Next?
- 2.1.1 will be our next bugfix release. Bugfix releases will be made available as we find and fix issues.
- 2.2.0 will be our next feature release. We are shooting for a February 2017 release.

The 2.0.x line will _not_ be updated to the Kubernetes 1.5 library. Those wishing to stay on the Kubernetes 1.4 codebase may continue running Helm 2.0.2. That said, we have tested Helm 2.1.0 with Kubernetes 1.4 and have found no issues.

## Notable Changes Since 2.0.1
- A substantial bug with `helm upgrade -f` has been fixed
- An updated Sprig library (2.7.0) has been included because it contains a substantial bug fix for `quote`
- `helm upgrade` and `helm rollback` can both deal with failed releases now
- gRPC's max message size is now 10M instead of 4M (which helps with large charts)

Version 2.0.2 is compatible with other version 2.0.x releases (client and server versions can be intermixed).

Helm is a the package manager for Kubernetes, designed to help teams collaborate on packaging, releasing, and managing applications in Kubernetes. We are excited to announce that this version of Helm has reached feature completion, and is stable for production use. 🎆 

In one year, Helm has over 2,200 commits from almost 70 contributors. Numbers like that illustrate why we :heart: the Kubernetes community. Thank you all for filing issues, chatting in Slack, submitting PRs, and contributing to the welcoming atmosphere of this project.

As we launch this release, the Helm chart repository has over two dozen charts, and we're eager to expand that catalog. Contributing charts is one of the many ways you can join in. Here are some other ways:

## Notable Changes Since 2.0.0-RC.2

Since RC.2, only minor changes have been made. Of those, a few are notable:
- The limit on release name length has gone from 14 characters to 53 characters. For Kubernetes 1.3, users may want to manually set release names to avoid auto-generated names that are too long.
- Release upgrades now correctly remove fields deleted on manifests.
- Log entries for Tiller now show the source file from which the log message was generated.
- With `helm install --dry-run --debug`, YAML parse errors will now display the YAML data.

You can also use a [script to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get) on any system with `bash`.

## What Next?

The 2.0.0 will be followed by a series of patch releases (2.0.x). We are also beginning on the next feature release (2.1.0). In GitHub, this is represented by the branching of the repository:

```
---v2.0.0 --- (master) --- v2.1.x
        \
         \--- (v2.0.x) --- v2.0.1
```
- The 2.0.x branch will contain patches to the 2.0.0 release. The next release on that branch will be 2.0.1. No new features will be introduced on the 2.0.x branch, and the API will remain unchanged.
- The master branch will house continued feature development. The next release on that branch will be 2.1.0. New features will be added, but no features will be removed.

## Until 2.0.0...

From here through the 2.0.0 release:
- All APIs are frozen, including Go APIs, protobuf files, and the template language
- All CLI nouns, verbs, and flags are frozen
- No features will be added

Documentation may still be changed, and bugs may be resolved. Internal refactoring may be done so long as it does not change the public APIs.

## Notable Changes
- Fixed authentication when running in-cluster `helm`
- Improved error handling for `helm delete`
- Added a new ""Chart Template Developer's Guide"" to docs

4552272,2016-11-02T19:19:26Z,2016-11-02T20:22:33Z,Almost There!,"Helm v2.0.0-rc.1 is the first release candidate for the Helm 2.0.0 release. The RC phase is simply our last effort to ensure that Helm is operating as intended. As soon as we feel that the code is solid, we will release the final v2.0.0 version.

As usual, the Helm community has done a stellar job contributing issues, documentation, patches, and support. 👍 Feel free to join in! We're a growing community and value new contributions.

- Developer Call: Thursday, 9:30 Pacific via [Zoom](https://engineyard.zoom.us/j/366425549)
- Chart Development: [GitHub/kubernetes/charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts)

## Until 2.0.0...

From here through the 2.0.0 release:
- All APIs are frozen, including Go APIs, protobuf files, and the template language
- All CLI nouns, verbs, and flags are frozen
- No features will be added

Documentation may still be changed, and bugs may be resolved. Internal refactoring may be done so long as it does not change the public APIs.

## Notable Changes
- Kubernetes 3rd Party API objects are now enabled (had been disabled for testing)
- Kubernetes default configuration is initialized on startup (for Kubeadm)
- Password-locked GPG keys are now supported via a password prompt
- `helm rollback` now works across a `helm install --replace`
- Many bugs were fixed

## Notable Fixes
- `NOTES.txt` is now once again output correctly during `helm install`
- Helm releases are now compressed before storage
- `helm version --client` now prints out just the client version (and does not connect to Tiller)
- `requirements.lock` is not regenerated if `helm dep up` produces an identical digest.
- the `--set` flag now writes `true` and `false` values as bools instead of strings. Similarly, it writes integers and floats as numeric types instead of strings.
- `helm serve` now regenerates the local `index.yaml` file automatically

## Installing and Updating

Helm binaries:
- [OSX](http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.0.0-beta.2-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)

The [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) will get you going from there.

## Moving Forward

**WARNING:** This release is not backward compatible. We try hard to avoid compatibility breaks because we know it is an inconvenience to you. But we made a tough call: It is better to correct some of our design flaws now than force everyone to ""live with them"" for the entirety of the 2.0.0 lifecycle. We apologize for the inconvenience, and we don't plan on any other compatibility breaks between now and 2.0.0.

As always, we want to give a big :heart: to the community, which has continued to find bugs, submit issues, fix things, and participate in conversations. If you'd like to be a part of the community, we invite you to join the Kubernetes Helm Slack channel, drop in on a Thursday Developer Call, and jump in on the GitHub issue queues.

## Binary Downloads

Binary downloads of the Alpha.5 Helm client can be found at the following links:
- [OSX](http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.0.0-alpha.5-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Linux](http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.0.0-alpha.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Linux 32-bit](http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.0.0-alpha.5-linux-386.tar.gz)

### The big changes:
- Introducing `helm rollback`: A command for reverting a release to a previous version. It can even undelete releases that were deleted.
- Helm and Tiller now are version-aware. They can better indicate whether they are compatible. **You will get compatibility errors** running `helm` alpha.4 and `tiller` alpha.5, for example.
- Chart developers, we added a tool to help you manage chart dependencies. Check out `helm dependency install` and the new `requirements.yaml` file.
- Repositories have been overhauled. To make it easier to find, install, and manage charts, we changed the format of `index.yaml`. **If you run a chart repo, you should re-generate the index file!**
- Finally, we have worked hard to make some UX improvements:
  - The `kubernetes-charts` directory was renamed `stable`. Hooray for brevity.
  - `helm update` was changed to `helm repo update`
  - `helm history` is a new command to make it easy to see the history of a release.
  - `helm search` was rewritten to make it more usable
    - `helm search` with no term will return all charts
    - `helm search stable/` will return all charts in the repository named stable
  - We dropped the requirement that you install with an explicit version number.
    - `helm install stable/mariadb` now installs the latest `mariadb` chart from the `stable` repository.
    - `helm install stable/mariadb --version 0.1.0` now installs version `0.1.0` (rather than the latest)
    - The same syntax is true for `helm inspect`, `helm upgrade`, and `helm fetch`
    - Commands that generate listing (`search`, `list`, etc.) now use the table layout by default.

### Changes for chart developers

In addition to the new `helm dependency *` tools, we have made a few small changes in the templates. Two new functions were added:
- `uuidv4` generates a random UUIDv4
- `toYaml` encodes a value into YAML

## Getting Started with 2.0.0-Alpha.5

The best way to get started is to head over to the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md). Or for more alternative installations, see the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md).

Please [let us know](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues) if you find any issues with those guides. We want Helm installation to be an easy and reliable process.

When upgrading to a new version of Tiller, we recommend using `kubectl` to delete the old one: `kubectl delete deployment --namespace kube-system tiller`. This will _not_ delete your releases. From there, running `helm init` will update you to the latest.

For Mac OSX

``` console
$ export HELM_OS=darwin && wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.0.0-alpha.5-$HELM_OS-amd64.tar.gz && tar -zxvf helm-v2.0.0-alpha.5-$HELM_OS-amd64.tar.gz && cd $HELM_OS-amd64
```

For Linux

``` console
$ export HELM_OS=linux && wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.0.0-alpha.5-$HELM_OS-amd64.tar.gz && tar -zxvf helm-v2.0.0-alpha.5-$HELM_OS-amd64.tar.gz && cd $HELM_OS-amd64
```

## What's Next?

We consider Alpha.5 to be feature complete. The developers are now working on fixing bugs, improving stability, and building some great docs. This is a great time to jump in.

Our next release will be `v2.0.0-beta.1`. And we will be rolling out betas until we feel like the tool is ready for production use.

- ConfigMap storage is now the default backend. When you create a release with Helm, the release data will be stored in config maps in the `kube-system` namespace. This means releases are now persistent.
- `helm status` got a much-needed overhaul, and now provides lots of useful information about the details of a release.
- The Tiller server now checks the `apiVersion` field of manifests before loading a chart into Kubernetes. Now, for example, a chart that uses PetSets will stop early if it detects that the Kubernetes installation does not support PetSets.
- Helm can now cryptographically verify the integrity of a packaged chart using a provenance file. To this end, `helm package` now has a `--sign` flag, and several commands now have a `--verify` flag.

In addition to these, the Helm community has added numerous improvements and bug fixes, including:
- Fixing a bug that prevented some installations of Alpha.3 from executing `helm list`
- Limiting the length of a release name
- Adding an `icon:` field to Chart.yaml
- Improving `helm lint` and `helm upgrade`

## Getting Started

This is the second release of Helm that includes pre-built client binaries.

To get started, download the appropriate client from the release and unpack unpack it:

For Mac OSX

``` console
$ export HELM_OS=darwin && wget https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases/download/v2.0.0-alpha.4/helm-v2.0.0-alpha.4-$HELM_OS-amd64.tar.gz && tar -zxvf helm-v2.0.0-alpha.4-$HELM_OS-amd64.tar.gz && cd $HELM_OS-amd64
```

For Linux

``` console
$ export HELM_OS=linux && wget https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases/download/v2.0.0-alpha.4/helm-v2.0.0-alpha.4-$HELM_OS-amd64.tar.gz && tar -zxvf helm-v2.0.0-alpha.4-$HELM_OS-amd64.tar.gz && cd $HELM_OS-amd64
```

To configure Helm, run the `init` command:

``` console
$ ./helm init
```

OSX users may prefer to use Homebrew to install Helm.

## What's Next

The next release, Alpha.5, marks the last major feature release before we focus on stability. You can expect to see `helm rollback` implemented, along with better version support, and the addition of a `dependencies:` section in Chart.yaml.

After Alpha.5, the Helm team will focus on closing bugs and improving stability as we sail toward a Helm 2.0.0 final release.

This will configure your local Helm, and also install and configure the in-cluster Tiller component.

3860896,2016-08-10T22:04:02Z,2016-08-10T22:33:45Z,Alpha.3: New 'helm upgrade' command and many more features,"Helm v2.0.0-Alpha.3 has many new features and improvements. It marks our biggest release yet. Alpha 3 focused on bringing a number of big features into both the Helm client and the Tiller server.

The Helm team owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to our outstanding community, which has been a source of ideas, issues, fixes, features, and encouragement. Thank you!

## Features

The headliner features are:
- **Binary builds of the Helm client are now available!**
- A new `helm upgrade` command can upgrade releases in place. We suggest using Kubernetes `Deployments` for maximum impact.
- A vastly improved `helm status` command shows you information about the current state of your releases.
- Helm now has commands for getting information about a release using `helm get`, `helm get values`, `helm get hooks`, and `helm get manifest`.
- By default, releases are still stored in memory. But they may now optionally be stored in Kubernetes ConfigMaps instead. In subsequent releases, ConfigMaps will become the default.
- The new `helm inspect` command allows users to preview chart information before installing a chart: `helm inspect kube-charts/alpine-0.1.0`
- Tiller now installs into the `kube-system` namespace, but can install charts into any namespace it has write access to.
- Helm supports hooks for pre-install, post-install, pre-upgrade, post-upgrade, pre-delete, and post-delete. With these, you can now attach Kubernetes jobs to release events.

### Template System Changes

There have been several changes to the template system. The most important changes are:
- Extra files supplied in a chart are now accessible using the `{{.Files}}` object. For example, to load the file `foo/info.yaml` into a template, you may use `{{.Files.Get(""foo/info.yaml""}}`
- The new `{{.Template}}` object provides access to information about the current template.
- All values are accessible in templates as `{{.Values.someValue}}`. Global values are available in `{{.Values.global.someValue}}`. The existing pre-defined top level template namespaces are now `{{.Values}}`, `{{.Files}}`, `{{.Release}}`, `{{.Template}}`, and `{{.Chart}}`.
- A new template function called `include` can now be used to import another template in place. This is preferable to the Go built-in `template` directive. `include` can be chained: `{{include ""foo.tpl"" | indent 4}}`.

## Notable Changes and Fixes
- Tiller, the Helm server, now runs as a Kubernetes Deployment instead of a Replication Controller.
- A `helm delete` now reaps related resources. So deleting a `Deployment` will result in deletion of its `ReplicaSet` and its `Pod`s.
- A release name can be re-used with `helm install --replace`. For CI/CD systems, we've also added a `--name-template` flag to `helm install` to make it easier to predictably auto-generate releases.
- Install values can now be passed on the command line with `helm install --set NAME=VALUE`.
- `helm lint` now has a `--strict` flag.

Numerous other bugs and fixes have been applied, and both Helm and Tiller are more stable.

## For Developers

Previous versions of Helm did development using `scripts/local-cluster.sh`. We now recommend using Minikube. We've also improved tooling for test coverage, CI/CD, and linting.

## Coming Soon to a Cluster Near You...

The next release will be `v2.0.0-alpha.4`. While Alpha 4 is largely focused on stability, a few exciting features are on the roadmap:
- `helm rollback` to roll back to an older version of a release.
- Provenance and cryptographic integrity checks with `helm package --sign` and `helm install --verify`.
- An overhaul of the [Kubernetes Chart Repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts) (Check it out. The change is already underway!)

3512049,2016-06-23T17:42:48Z,2016-06-23T20:16:31Z,Alpha.2: Updates to everything!,"This release marks the second of four planned Alpha releases. We have made a lot of progress (and a lot of changes) since Alpha.1. Here are the highlights:

## Features:
-  `helm lint` has gotten a major overhaul. The core architecture is now considered stable, and the linter team is transitioning focus to (a) adding rules, and (b) integrating linting into the chart development workflow.
- Helm's server-side Tiller component can now be installed into any namespace. Alpha.1 restricted Tiller to the `helm` namespace. Now Tiller is installed into the user's configured namespace (usually `default`) by default, but can be installed into any namespace.
- Values files are now in YAML format (bye-bye TOML). We're _experimenting_ with support for globally scoped variables.
- Templates now support more functions (Sprig 2.3). We still have a few big changes coming to the template system, but the new `docs/examples/nginx` template provides a better example of how we envision template support.
- `helm install` can now install directly from a chart repository.
- Helm charts now support `.helmignore` files, which are similar to `.gitignore` files, providing a convenient way to tell Helm about files that should not be packaged into the chart.
- Tiller has liveness and readiness probes for Kubernetes

## Fixes:
- Documentation has been improved throughout
- The Helm repository has been improved, and the repository index file is now stable
- The `pkg/helm` and `pkg/chartutil` packages have been overhauled, and `pkg/chart` has been removed
- The import path is now `k8s.io/helm`, thus delaying the onset of carpal tunnel in all Helm contributors
- And many, many more

_We are tremendously grateful to the community for a wealth of feedback, use cases, and pull requests._

## Looking Ahead

We have some big things coming:
- Support for [managing multiple namespaces with one Tiller instance](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/838)
- The addition of [many linting rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/pull/857)
- A [few changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/859) to the template language (Warning: some will break backward compatibility with Alpha.2)
- Using [ConfigMaps for storage](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/656) of Tiller data
- The addition of a `helm upgrade` [command](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/690) that can upgrade a release to a newer chart version!
- And an official charts repository with contribution guidelines and a number of new charts

We're excited to be rapidly iterating on Kubernetes Helm. And while we're all anxious to get Helm stable and released, the team has demonstrated a strong commitment to making this a reliable tool that meets the needs of a growing Kubernetes community.

Helm 2 has two major components:
- The `helm` client, whose responsibility is to provide tooling for working with charts and uploading them to the server.
- The `tiller` server, whose responsibility is to manage releases into the Kubernetes cluster.

Additionally, Helm can fetch charts from remote repositories. A Helm 2 chart repository is simply an HTTP server capable of serving YAML and TGZ files.

As a developer preview, the Alpha 1 release does not have a binary build of its components. The quickest route to get started is to fetch the source, and then do a `make bootstrap build`. To start using Helm, use `helm init`.
