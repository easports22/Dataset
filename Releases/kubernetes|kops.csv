* Updates kube-dns for CVE-2017-14491.  For more details, please see the [CVE Advisory](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/advisories/cve_2017_14491.md).

# Required Actions

* All users are recommended to upgrade to this version of kops (you need not upgrade your version of kubernetes to do so.)  Alternatively, there are simple [manual commands to update kube-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/advisories/cve_2017_14491.md#hotfix-instructions).

# Significant changes

* Manifests are rewritten by default, which includes a normalization phase.
  This can make it hard to understand the actual changes (as opposed to just the formatting changes).
  A feature flag has been added, `export KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=""-RewriteManifests""` which can be used to disable manifest rewriting.  A recommendation: you can run `kops update` twice, once without
  manifest formatting to show the real changes, and then immediately afterward with manifest changes,
  which will be just formatting changes.  Run `KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=""-RewriteManifests"" kops update cluster`,
  to show the real changes, apply them with `KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=""-RewriteManifests"" kops update cluster --yes`,
  then run `kops update cluster` to show the formatting changes, followed by `kops update cluster --yes`

* Default disk size increased to 64GB (masters) and 128GB (nodes).  This does have a higher cost but also gives us more inodes & more IOPS (and more disk space, of course!)
* Calico now configured with the correct pod CIDR: #2768. Please refer to the *Required Actions* section for details regarding this.

# Required Actions

* Existing Calico users on clusters that were created prior to kops 1.7 are susceptible to IP conflict between Pods and Services due to an overlap of the two IP ranges. Migration to a new Pod CIDR is recommended and is a manual procedure due to the risk of potential downtime during this operation. For the migration procedure, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs//upgrade_from_kops_1.6_to_1.7_calico_cidr_migration.md).

### Known Issues
- Kubernetes upgrade from 1.5 -> 1.6 requires a configmap to be created in the kube-system namespace. If `kubectl -n kube-system get configmap` does not return a configmap with the name ""kube-dns"". BEFORE upgrade please execute `kubectl create configmap -n kube-system kube-dns`.
- Kubernetes upgrades from 1.5 -> 1.6 users have noticed some issues with taints when running HA masters.  Editing the taints by hand is a workaround. See: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/2594
- Some Kubernetes upgrades from 1.6.x -> 1.6.x have experience issues with secrets and service accounts.  Deleting the secrets have been a workaround (not validated). See: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/2576
- Calico users have noticed problems using Calico with Kubernetes 1.6, this has been fixed in master, and will be released in kops 1.6.1.

1.6.0-alpha.1 is a prerelease early-access of kops 1.6, which is the release with full support for kubernetes 1.6.
This version of kops & kubernetes has not yet undergone extensive validation, and there will be improvements
made before release of kops 1.6.0.

This is not a full set of release notes, but rather a summary of the highest impact changes in the 1.6 release:

* RBAC can be enabled by passing the `--authorization=rbac` parameter to `kops create cluster`,
or via `kops edit cluster` and change `authorization` from `alwaysAllow: {}` to `rbac: {}`

* The standard RBAC policy for 1.6 means that all access to the Kubernetes API using the default
service account method will be denied.

* The taints & tolerations have changed as part of their graduation from alpha.  The taint is now a field on the node:

```yaml
spec:
  taints:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
```

An example toleration (as used in dns-controller) is:

```yaml
spec:
  tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
```

Note that the annotation form is ignored.  To schedule a pod on the master, the toleration must be updated
and moved from an annotation to the field.

* A new label for nodes, mirroring the toleration, is added and is now preferred: `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=`
(`node-role.kubernetes.io/master` with an empty value).  `kubernetes.io/role=master` is still present, but
the `node-role.kubernetes.io/<role>=` form is preferred.  `kubernetes.io/role=node` and `node-role.kubernetes.io/node=`
are also present.

Workaround: create the configmap with `kubectl create configmap -n kube-system kube-dns` before updating.

## Known Issues

##### Rolling updates

Rolling update to 1.6 does not succeed because new kube-dns pods mount a configmap with an optional volume map,
but that is enforced by the kubelets, which are upgraded after the master.

##### etcd3

`kops` is not yet recommending etcd3.   Right now we are working on resolving issues such as HA upgrade support.",https://api.github.com/users/justinsb,100893,justinsb,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/5924066/assets,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/5924066,a4ea3ea5da54963e3862a087a3b5e658017a7b08,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/tarball/1.6.0-alpha.1,https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/tag/1.6.0-alpha.1,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/zipball/1.6.0-alpha.1,1.6.0-alpha.1,False,True

- Network overlays: `--networking calico` `--networking kopeio-vxlan` or `--networking weave`
- Isolated networks (nodes do not have public IPs): `--topology private`
- Bastion support for isolated networks: `--bastion`
- Private hosted zone: `--dns private`
- API can be exposed via DNS, or by an internet-facing ELB, or by a private ELB
- Enhanced model that allows for complex subnet configurations
