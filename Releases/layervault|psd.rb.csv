Text in text fields is now read directly from the descriptor instead of from psd-enginedata parsed data. This should solve some parsing issues.

psd-enginedata was also updated, which fixes some of it's own character encoding issues, so I highly recommend getting the latest version of that as well.

- Lots of code cleanup, especially for PSD::Node related stuff
- A few new layer info blocks
- Experimental vector drawing (currently disabled)
- Can now get node paths as an array, which avoids issues with names that have forward slashes in them.

## Fixes
- Significant speedups in many areas of the renderer, including:
  - Canvas composing
  - Mask application
  - Pixel blending
  - Color overlay
  - RGB processing
- Less reliance on method_missing and more explicit method declaration in a few areas
- Clipping masks now support clipping multiple layers
- Applies masks to clipping masks before clipping
- Applies fill color to filled canvases
- Fixes rendering single layers (no longer double-renders them)
- Fixes some one-off errors during mask application
- Layer masks now respect layer comp position offsets, when applicable
- Fixes bugs with layer comp position and visibility application
- Group masks on passthru groups are now properly applied
- Some Descriptor parsing fixes, especially for PSDs that contain references
- Blend modes with spaces in the name work properly now
- Layer styles now respect the master FX switch for the layer
- Color overlay now renders properly (fixes aliasing issue)
- Fixes search bug that occured when two nodes of the same name were at the same depth
- Node searching unintentionally modified the passed-in path parameter

- Undefined method error when parsing layer masks
- Memory leak when parsing image data
- Significant speed improvements related to parsing image data

# New Features
- JRuby and Rubinius compatibility (with tests)
- Layer comps
  - Retrieve all available layer comps in document
  - Filter tree nodes based on layer comp
  - Read layer metadata and settings

Also worth mentioning is that PSD.rb now has a native extension that speeds up the slowest parts of the library, mostly in regards to image data parsing. Be sure to check out [psd_native](https://github.com/layervault/psd_native) if native extensions are an option for you.
