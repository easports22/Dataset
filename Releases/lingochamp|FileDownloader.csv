> - Now, rather than using `FileDownloader#init`, if you want to register your own customize components for FileDownloader please invoking `FileDownloader.setupOnApplicationOnCreate(application):InitCustomMaker` on the `Application#onCreate`, otherwise you just need invoke `FileDownloader.setup(Context)` anytime before using `FileDownloader`.

### Important:
- Since this version you can customize you own [FileDownloadConnection](https://github.com/lingochamp/FileDownloader/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/liulishuo/filedownloader/connection/FileDownloadConnection.java) component, we use [this one](https://github.com/lingochamp/FileDownloader/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/liulishuo/filedownloader/connection/FileDownloadUrlConnection.java) as default.
- Since this version, FileDownloader don't dependency the okhttp as default.

> If you still need to configure `timeout`、`proxy` for the connection component, but you don't want to implement your own one, configurations, I implement it for the default connection component too, just move to: [DemoApplication](https://github.com/lingochamp/FileDownloader/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/com/liulishuo/filedownloader/demo/DemoApplication.java#L35), check the code if you want.

#### New Interfaces
- Add `FileDownloadQueueSet#reuseAndStart`: Add reuseAndStart function to the queue-set to reuse task instances before start them. Ref #383

The operation of method `InQueueTask#enqueue()` is the same to the Deprecated method `BaseDownloadTask#ready()`, we wrap the `ready()` method in this way just want you to know clearly: Only if the task belongs to a queue, you need to invoke this method otherwise if this task is an isolated task but you invoke this method, it's wrong and you will receive an exception(More detail reason please move to the exception thrown in `DownloadTask#start`).

#### Enhancement
- Improve Robust: Ensure the minimum time interval between each callback of 'progress' is 5ms, To prevent internal callback of 'progress' too frequent happening. Closes #167.
- Improve Practicability: Print the 'warn' priority log when a request does something in the FileDownloadService but it isn't connected yet.
- Improve Performance: Using the `SparseArray` instead of `HashMap` for mapping all `FileDownloadModel`.

#### Fix
- Fix(crash): Fix provided wrong params in formatting character string when to starting download runnable occur the unexpected downloading status.
- Fix(force-re-download): Fix the wrong logic: In the case of `BaseDownloadTask#setForceReDownload(true)` and the task has already downloaded will trigger 'warn' callback. Closes #169 .
- Fix(class-type): Keep the class type of `SocketTimeOutException`, and no longer care about whether the message of Throwable is empty, this is very redundant.

#### Others
- Upgrade dependency okhttp from `3.2.0` to `3.3.1`.

#### New Interfaces

> We default open Avoid Missing Screen Frames, if you want to disable it(will post to ui thread for each FileDownloadListener event achieved as pre version), please invoke: `FileDownloader.getImpl().disableAvoidDropFrame()`.
- `FileDownloadMonitor`: You can add the global monitor for Statistic/Debugging now.
- `FileDownloader#enableAvoidDropFrame(void)`: Avoid missing screen frames, but this leads to all callbacks of FileDownloadListener do not be invoked at once when it has already achieved.
- `FileDownloader#disableAvoidDropFrame(void)`: Disable avoid missing screen frames, let all callbacks of FileDownloadListener be invoked at once when it achieve.
- `FileDownloader#isEnabledAvoidDropFrame(void)`: Has already enabled Avoid Missing Screen Frames. Default: true
- `FileDownloader#setGlobalPost2UIInterval(intervalMillisecond:int)`: For Avoid Missing Screen Frames. Each intervalMillisecond post 1 message to ui thread at most. if the value is less than 0, each callback will always post a message to ui thread immediately, may will cause missing screen frames and produce great pressure on the ui thread Looper. Default: 10ms.
- `FileDownloader#setGlobalHandleSubPackageSize(packageSize:int)`: For Avoid Missing Screen Frames. {packageSize}: The number of FileDownloadListener's callback contained in each message. value completely dependent on the intervalMillisecond of setGlobalPost2UIInterval, describe will handle up to {packageSize} callbacks on the each message posted to ui thread. Default: 5.
- `BaseDownloadTask#setSyncCallback(syncCallback:boolean)`: if true will invoke callbacks of FileDownloadListener directly on the download thread(do not post the message to the ui thread), default false.
- `BaseDownloadTask#isSyncCallback(void):boolean`: Whether sync invoke callbacks of FileDownloadListener directly on the download thread.
- `FileDownloadUtils#setDefaultSaveRootPath`: The path is used as Root Path in the case of task without setting path in the entire Download Engine.
- `FileDownloadQueueSet`: In order to be more convenient to bind multiple tasks to a queue, and to the overall set.

#### Enhancement

#### Fix
- Fix can't resume from the break point naturally in case of the download status of the task is Error.
- Fix the size of the queue may not match the number of actual active tasks in case of high concurrency. This bug may would caused some callbacks to be consumed by the old tasks.

2441875,2016-01-13T05:14:29Z,2016-01-17T15:04:38Z,,"#### New Interfaces
- `FileDownloader#unBindServiceIfIdle(void)`: If there is no active task in the `:filedownloader` progress currently , then unbind & stop `:filedownloader` process
- `FileDownloader#getStatus(downloadId)`: Get download status by the downloadId(ps: Please refer to [Tasks Manager demo](https://github.com/lingochamp/FileDownloader/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/com/liulishuo/filedownloader/demo/TasksManagerDemoActivity.java)
- `FileDownloader#isServiceConnected(void)`: Whether started and connected to the `:filedownloader` progress(ps: Please refer to [Tasks Manager demo](https://github.com/lingochamp/FileDownloader/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/com/liulishuo/filedownloader/demo/TasksManagerDemoActivity.java))

#### Enhancement
- Supported [Chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding) data download(Recommend to glance at demo on [Single Task Test](https://github.com/lingochamp/FileDownloader/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/com/liulishuo/filedownloader/demo/SingleTaskTestActivity.java)).
- Improve Performance: Reduce IPC.
- Improve Performance: Reduce lock.
- Improve Performance: Delete invalid datas in db with the `:filedownloader` progress start.
- Improve Performance: Ignore the `callbackProgressTimes` column in db.

#### Fix
- Fix `FileDownloader#pauseAll` not effect in case of low memory and ui progress is Background Progress situation and the `:filedownloader` progress(Service Progress) alive and still have running tasks in the `filedownloader` progress but ui progress has died and relived.
- Fix not release connect resources when invoke `FileDownloader#unBinderService` manually.
- Handle case of ui progress be killed by sys and download progress not be killed, and ui progress relives and reexecutes same tasks queue.
