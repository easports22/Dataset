- Angular SEO support
- JWT based authentication (instead of sessions)
- Swagger support (API browsing of express endpoints)
- Admin package in core
- Mean Network integration

The clean urls and html5 push state support needed to make a clear distinction between server side routes and angular routes (the #! was removed).
To do so all express routes now start with /api/
