**Also looking for a maintainer!** 

Hero helped me learned a lot about iOS over the last year. Fighting the iOS animation system and dealing with UI bugs has been quite a journey. But I am sorry to say that I do not have to time to maintain this project anymore. The scope of this project has become unmanageable for me to handle. I am looking for a project maintainer to this project and I'm open to transfer this to a public organization instead of under my personal account.

So to prepare for stable release 1.0, there will be a few alpha versions. I will start to clean up issues and start monitor new ones. Feel free to submit anything you have encountered while using the new versions.

#### New Features

* `.useNoSnapshot` will now try to insert the view back to the view hierarchy once the transition completes. So you don't need to manually insert it back.
  * Note: for views that have collection view or table view as the superview, Hero might not be able to insert it into the correct subview index since the collection view and table view might have altered their subviews during the transition.
* `.useNoSnapshot` will now animate subview layout changes. Very convenient when you want your custom layout be animated during the transition.

* Added `.whenXXX` modifiers to make hero more declaritive.
  * instead of conforming to `HeroViewControllerDelegate`, you can now use `.whenPresenting`, `.whenDismissing`, `.whenApearing`, `.whenDisapearing`, `.whenMatched`, or your own conditions with `.when`
* Added `isHeroEnabledForSubviews` property on UIView. Setting this to true will let Hero skip over the subview tree. This saves a lot of computation time when the subview tree is complex.

* Better support iOS custom keyboard
* Better support `UIVisualEffectView`
* You can now create your own instance of `HeroTransition` instead of using `isHeroEnabled` & `Hero.shared`.
  * just create an instance of `HeroTransition` and assign it to the `transitionDelegate` property of your view controller.
* Added `viewOrderingStrategy` property to `HeroTransition` which allow you to customize which view controller should be inserted first during the transition.
* Added `isUserInteractionEnabled` property to `HeroTransition` which allow you to enable user interaction during the transition.
  * Note: by default, Hero will create snapshot of your views and use them for animation. They don't have the same event handler as your own views. So to enable user interaction, you have to apply `.useNoSnapshot` modifier to the views that you want to enabled user interaction. Also keep in mind that Hero can be in any state when you are handling user interaction. If you want to trigger a new transition, besure to call `cancel(animated: false)` or `finish(animated: false)` before starting the new transition.

* The following methods on `Hero` is removed in favor of creating your custom `HeroTransition` object
  * `func disableDefaultAnimationForNextTransition()`
  * `func setDefaultAnimationForNextTransition(_ animation: HeroDefaultAnimationType)`
  * `func setContainerColorForNextTransition(_ color: UIColor?)`

#### Bug fixes: 
* fix the ghosting effect where the source view and target view animates at different rate
* fix tab bar crashes and inconsistency when tapping too fast.

#### Future Roadmap:
1. Custom snapshot view
2. Masking support

- New **snapshot type** modifiers:
  - **useOptimizedSnapshot**
    
    With this modifier, Hero will create snapshot optimized for different view type when animating.
    For custom views or views with masking, useOptimizedSnapshot might create snapshots
    that appear differently than the actual view.
    In that case, use .useNormalSnapshot or .useSlowRenderSnapshot to disable the optimization.
  - **useNormalSnapshot**
    
    Create snapshot using snapshotView(afterScreenUpdates:).
  - **useLayerRenderSnapshot**
    
    Create snapshot using layer.render(in: currentContext).
    This is slower than .useNormalSnapshot but gives more accurate snapshot for some views (eg. UIStackView).
  - **useNoSnapshot**
    
    Force Hero to not create any snapshot when animating this view. Hence Hero will animate on the view directly.
    This will mess up the view hierarchy. Therefore, view controllers have to rebuild its view structure after the transition finishes.
- New navigation extension on UIViewController (mainly to support **unwinding**):
  - **func hero_dismissViewController()**
    
    Dismiss the current view controller with animation. Will perform a navigationController.popViewController 
    if the current view controller is contained inside a navigationController.
  - **func hero_replaceViewController(with:UIViewController)**
    
    Replace the current view controller with another VC on the navigation/modal stack.
  - **func hero_unwindToRootViewController()**
    
    Unwind to the root view controller using Hero.
  - **func hero_unwindToViewController(_ toViewController:)**
    
    Unwind to a specific view controller using Hero.
  - **func hero_unwindToViewController(withSelector: Selector)**
    
    Unwind to a view controller that responds to the given selector using Hero.
  - **func hero_unwindToViewController(withClass: AnyClass)**
    
    Unwind to a view controller with given class using Hero.

5102208,2017-01-09T07:39:53Z,2017-01-09T07:42:44Z,HUGE Update. Revamped Hero Modifier implementation. Bug fixes.,"- add **HeroModifier** class and **HeroTargetState** struct
  - **HeroModifier** is a swift enum-like class that provides the same functionality of the original string-based **heroModifiers**.
  - **HeroTargetState** is a struct that holds view state informations. It can be build from **[HeroModifier]**. Mostly used internally and for building **HeroPlugin**.
- change the original `heroModifiers:String?` to `heroModifierString:String?` **(breaking change!)**
- add `heroModifiers:[HeroModifier]?` to **UIView**
- add a shared singleton `Hero` object for controlling the interactive transition. Which can be accessed by `Hero.shared`
- few changes to the protocols 
  - protocol **HeroAnimator**
    
    ``` swift
    func temporarilySet(view:UIView, to modifiers:HeroModifiers)
    // to 
    func temporarilySet(view:UIView, targetState:HeroTargetState)
    ```
  - protocol **HeroViewControllerDelegate**
    
    ``` swift
    @objc optional func wantInteractiveHeroTransition(context:HeroInteractiveContext) -> Bool
    // to
    @objc optional func wantInteractiveHeroTransition() -> Bool
    ```
  - remove **HeroInteractiveContext** protocol
- update **HeroPlugin** to conform to the new protocols definitions.
- rename a few modifiers:
  - **curve** → **timingFunction**
  - **sourceID** → **source**
  - **clearSubviewModifiers** → **ignoreSubviewModifiers**
- fix a bug with `heroReplaceViewController` API. [PR 30](https://github.com/lkzhao/Hero/pull/30)
- fix a bug with **UIStackView** not animating correctly. [PR 22](https://github.com/lkzhao/Hero/pull/22)
- add **recursive** `ignoreSubviewModifiers` modifier
- add **radial** & **inverseRadial** cascade:

### To migrate from previous versions:

Do a whole-project **find & replace**(cmd+option+shift+F) for:
- **heroModifiers** → **heroModifierString**
- **curve** → **timingFunction**
- **sourceID** → **source**
- **clearSubviewModifiers** → **ignoreSubviewModifiers**
  
  Remember to also replace these inside the storyboard. In code, please migrate to the new type-safe `heroModifiers`. It provides better type-checking and more functionality.
