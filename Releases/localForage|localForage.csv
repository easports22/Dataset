Try to re-establish IDB connection after an InvalidStateError (#694 by @stkao05). Really cool for long running apps.
Added Generics to `iterate()` TS Typings (#713 by @DaSchTour).
Define custom drivers syncronously when `_support` isn't a function (#692 by @gabrielmaldi).
Use the custom driver API for internal drivers, which makes possible to override parts of their implementation.
