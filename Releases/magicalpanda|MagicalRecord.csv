#### What's changed since Beta 1?
- `MR_createInContext:` has been deprecated in favour of the more consistent `MR_createEntityInContext:`
- `MR_deleteInContext:` has been deprecated in favour of the more consistent `MR_deleteEntityInContext:`
- Logging can now be controlled at runtime. It is not necessary to define `MR_LOGGING_ENABLED` — just use the new `+ [MagicalRecord setLogLevel: … ];` method — there is [documentation on the new logging method in the wiki](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord/wiki/Logging)
- Add `MR_findFirstOrCreateByAttribute: …` methods to the `NSManagedObject+MagicalFinders` category
- Fix data imports so that the return value from `-(BOOL)import<#AttributeName#>:` data import methods is not ignored
- Fix the return type of the `- MR_aggregateOperation: …` methods — it was never guaranteed that the return value would be an `NSNumber`, so the type is now `id`
- Fix an issue where `MR_clearContextForCurrentThread` was not clearing the context cache version which would cause an assertion failure on the next call to `MR_contextForCurrentThread`
- Restore `+ MR_fetchController: delegate: useFileCache: groupedBy: inContext:` method to public header
- Some documentation has been updated in the wiki, but it is very much a work in progress
