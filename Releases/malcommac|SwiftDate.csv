- [#408](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/pull/408) `Date` and `DateInRegion` has now two functions to round a date to certain interval (expressed in `seconds` or `minutes`). `DateInRegion` exposes `roundAt()` which directly modify the date itself; `Date`, as immutable object, exposes the same feature in `roundedAt()` function (which return a new `Date` instances).
- [#414](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/pull/414) Added Daylight Saving Time functions: `.isDST` in `DateInRegion` (it returns true if the date uses daylight saving time);  `.DSTOffset` in `DateInRegion` (it returns the value (in seconds)  of the daylight saving time offset of the represented date),  `. nextDSTTransitionDate` in `DateInRegion` (it returns the next daylight saving time transition after currently represented date when expressed); `nextDSTTransitionDate()` func in `Date` (it returns the next dst transition date when receiver is expressed in a particular timezone); `DSTOffset()` func in `Date` (it returns the offset of daylight saving time when receiver is expressed in a particular timezone); `isDST()` func in `Date` (it returns if receiver date uses daylight saving time when expressed in a particular timezone).

#### Fixes
- [#410](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/pull/410) Several fixes while parsing less common `ISO8601` formats (weeks only w/wo implicit year/month/day).
- [#411](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/pull/411) Parsing an `ISO8601` string now results in a `DateInRegion` which contains the correct timezone defined (`Date` instances are now converted automatically to be time-independent).
- [#412](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/pull/412) Updated Unit Tests to become compatible with the new APIs changes. All tests now passes.

#### New Features
- [#402](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/pull/402) Added Greek localization (thanks to @dimmdesign)
- [#399](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/pull/399) `colloquialSinceNow` also allows to set `unitsStyle` params to specify the type of values you want to print.
- [#400](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/pull/400) `DateInRegion` has a class func named `date(formats:fromRegion)` which allows parsing a single string with multiple formats (the first one that succeeds returns the instance of the `DateInRegion`). Also available as `String` extension (with the same name).
- [#223](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/pull/223) `ISO8601DateTimeFormatter` now recognize the timezone of an ISO string and create a date with the correct value.
- [#407](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/pull/407) SwiftDate now can parse ISO8601 strings without specifyng the ISO format; it evaluates the best format automatically. Also the parser faster than the previous built one. Since now `.iso8601` parsing format is used only as formatter (from date to string, viceversa any given value is ignored. You are encouraged to use `.iso8601Auto` instead).

	The following ISO8601 variants are supported:

```
YYYYMMDD
YYYY-MM-DD
YYYY-MM
YYYY
YY //century 
//Implied century: YY is 00-99

- [#214](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/214), Added `.next(day:)` both for `Date` and `DateInRegion` to get the next weekday (ie. ""next friday from today"") after specified date.
- [#310](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/310) Added static func `.dates(between:and:increment:)` both for `Date` and `DateInRegion` which allows to enumerate dates between two interval with given increment in term of `DateComponents`.
- [#337](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/337) DateComponents now implements `.in()` func you can use to express an interval (like using `TimeInterval`) in terms of other time units (for example `let x = 120.seconds.in(.minute)` will return 2 minutes).
- [#348](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/348) `DateComponents` can now be merged using `&&` operator. So if you have `A = 1.hours, 3.minutes, 2.seconds` and `B = 1.year, 40.minutes`, using `let C = A && B` you will get a new `DateComponents` instance with: `C = 1.year, 1.hours, 43.minutes, 2.seconds`.

#### Fixes:
- [#344](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/344) `.inDateDefaultRegion()` is also used as standard value for region in `.add()` function of the `Date` object
- [#339](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/339) Fixed an issue with reverse interval fatal error when subtracting two dates
- [#317](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/317) Fixed an issue with language transations. Now all translations are specified in term of language+region settings (ie. `en-US` and not only `en`). All translation files were updated to reflect this new behaviour.
- [#346](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/issues/346) Workaround to fix a rounding problem when comparing two `Date` or `DateInRegion` in terms of `.nanosecond` granularity. Now the comparision result is correct.

Also .string() function in TimeInterval is now replaced by a counterpart which take ComponentsFormatterOptions struct.
