- Refactored a good deal of the internals to fix issues with the view controller life cycle
- Exposed the main UI elements, rather than individual properties for each element, allowing for more explicit customization and less forcing of design styles by the framework
- Deprecated the custom styling properties and the convenience methods to set them globally. These deprecated methods will be removed in the next release (v3.0.0) to keep everything as tidy as possible because I'm slightly OCD.
