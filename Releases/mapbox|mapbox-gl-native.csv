### Networking and storage

* Added a new `MGLMapSnapshotter` class for capturing rendered map images from an `MGLMapView`’s camera. (#9891)
* Reduced the time it takes to create new `MGLMapView` instances in some cases. (#9864)
* Added support for forced cache revalidation that will eliminate flickering that was sometimes visible for certain types of tiles (e.g., traffic tiles). (#9670)
* Improved the performance of the SDK when parsing vector tile data used to render the map. (#9312)

### Styles

* Added a new type of source, represented by the `MGLImageSource` class at runtime, that displays a georeferenced image. (#9110)
* Setting a style using `MGLMapView`'s `styleURL` property now smoothly transitions from the previous style to the new style and maintains equivalent layers and sources along with their identifiers. (#9256)
* Added `MGLCircleStyleLayer.circlePitchAlignment` and `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.iconPitchAlignment` properties to control whether circles and symbols lie flat against a tilted map. (#9426, #9479)
* Added an `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.iconAnchor` property to control where an icon is anchored. (#9849)
* The `maximumTextWidth` and `textLetterSpacing` properties of `MGLSymbolStyleLayer` are now compatible with `MGLSourceStyleFunction`s and `MGLCompositeStyleFunction`s, allowing data-driven styling of these properties. (#9870)
* Improved the legibility of labels that follow lines when the map is tilted. (#9009)
* Fixed an issue that could cause flickering when a translucent raster style layer was present. (#9468)
* Fixed an issue that could cause antialiasing between polygons on the same layer to fail if the fill layers used data-driven styling for the fill color. (#9699)
* The previously deprecated support for style classes has been removed. For interface compatibility, the API methods remain, but they are now non-functional.

### Annotations and user interaction

* Fixed several bugs and performance issues related to the use of annotations backed by `MGLAnnotationImage`. The limits on the number and size of images and glyphs has been effectively eliminated and should now depend on hardware constraints. These fixes also apply to images used to represent icons in `MGLSymbolStyleLayer`. (#9213)
* Increased the default maximum zoom level from 20 to 22. (#9835)
* Added an `overlays` property to `MGLMapView`. (#8617)
* Selecting an annotation no longer sets the user tracking mode to `MGLUserTrackingModeNone`. (#10094)

### Other changes

* Fixed an issue that could cause line label rendering glitches when the line geometry is projected to a point behind the plane of the camera. (#9865)
* Fixed an issue that could cause a crash when using `-[MGLMapView flyToCamera:completionHandler:]` and related methods with zoom levels at or near the maximum value. (#9381)
* Added `-[MGLMapView showAttribution:]` to allow custom attribution buttons to show the default attribution interface. (#10085)

([#9426](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9426), [#9479](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9479))
* Added an `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.iconAnchor` property to control where an icon is anchored. ([#9849](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9849))
* The `maximumTextWidth` and `textLetterSpacing` properties of `MGLSymbolStyleLayer` are now compatible with `MGLSourceStyleFunction`s and `MGLCompositeStyleFunction`s, allowing data-driven styling of these properties. ([#9870](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9870))
* Improved the legibility of labels that follow lines when the map is tilted. ([#9009](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9009))
* Fixed an issue that could cause flickering when a translucent raster style layer was present. ([#9468](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9468))
* Fixed an issue that could cause antialiasing between polygons on the same layer to fail if the fill layers used data-driven styling for the fill color. ([#9699](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9699))
* The previously deprecated support for style classes has been removed. For interface compatibility, the API methods remain, but they are now non-functional.

### Annotations and user interaction

* Fixed several bugs and performance issues related to the use of annotations backed by `MGLAnnotationImage`. The limits on the number and size of images and glyphs has been effectively eliminated and should now depend on hardware constraints. These fixes also apply to images used to represent icons in `MGLSymbolStyleLayer`. ([#9213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9213))
* Increased the default maximum zoom level from 20 to 22. ([#9835](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9835))
* Added an `overlays` property to `MGLMapView`. ([#8617](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8617))

### Other changes

* Fixed an issue that could cause line label rendering glitches when the line geometry is projected to a point behind the plane of the camera. ([#9865](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9865))
* Fixed an issue that could cause a crash when using `-[MGLMapView flyToCamera:completionHandler:]` and related methods with zoom levels at or near the maximum value. ([#9381](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9381))

[Changes](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/compare/macos-v0.4.1...macos-v0.5.0) since [macos-v0.4.1](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/releases/tag/macos-v0.4.1):

## Packaging

* Xcode 8.0 or higher is now recommended for using this SDK. (#8775)
* Updated MGLMapView’s logo view to display [the new Mapbox logo](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/new-mapbox-logo/). (#8771, #8773)

## Styles

* Added support for 3D extrusion of buildings and other polygonal features via the `MGLFillExtrusionStyleLayer` class and the `fill-extrusion` layer type in style JSON. (#8431)
* MGLMapView and MGLTilePyramidOfflineRegion now default to version 10 of the Mapbox Streets style. Similarly, several style URL class methods of MGLStyle return URLs to version 10 styles. Unversioned variations of these methods are no longer deprecated. `MGLStyleDefaultVersion` should no longer be used with any style other than Streets. (#6301)
* Added class methods to MGLStyle that correspond to the new [Traffic Day and Traffic Night](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/live-traffic-maps/) styles. (#6301)
* MGLSymbolStyleLayer’s `iconImageName`, `iconScale`, `textFontSize`, `textOffset`, and `textRotation` properties can now be set to a source or composite function. (#8544, #8590, #8592, #8593)
* Fixed an issue where setting the `MGLVectorStyleLayer.predicate` property failed to take effect if the relevant source was not in use by a visible layer at the time. (#8653)
* Fixed an issue preventing programmatically added style layers from appearing in already cached tiles. (#8954)
* Fixed an issue causing a composite function’s highest zoom level stop to be misinterpreted. (#8613, #8790)
* Fixed an issue where re-adding a layer that had been previously removed from a style would reset its paint properties. Moved initializers for `MGLTileSource`, `MGLStyleLayer`, and `MGLForegroundStyleLayer` to their concrete subclasses; because these classes were already intended for initialization only via concrete subclasses, this should have no developer impact. (#8626)
* Fixed a crash that occurred when removing a source that was still being used by one or more style layers. Since this is a programming error, a warning is logged to the console instead. (#9129)
* Feature querying results now account for any changes to a feature’s size caused by a source or composite style function. (#8665)

6883443,2017-06-29T18:52:32Z,2017-06-29T20:49:09Z,ios-v3.6.0,"[Changes](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/compare/ios-v3.5.4...ios-v3.6.0) since [Mapbox iOS SDK v3.5.4](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/releases/tag/ios-v3.5.4):

## Packaging

* Xcode 8.0 or higher is now recommended for using this SDK. (#8775)
* Fixed an issue in the static framework where localizations would never load. (#9074)
* Updated MGLMapView’s logo view to display [the new Mapbox logo](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/new-mapbox-logo/). (#8771, #8773)
* Added a Hungarian localization. (#9347)

## Styles

* Added support for 3D extrusion of buildings and other polygonal features via the `MGLFillExtrusionStyleLayer` class and the `fill-extrusion` layer type in style JSON. (#8431)
* MGLMapView and MGLTilePyramidOfflineRegion now default to version 10 of the Mapbox Streets style. Similarly, several style URL class methods of MGLStyle return URLs to version 10 styles. Unversioned variations of these methods are no longer deprecated. `MGLStyleDefaultVersion` should no longer be used with any style other than Streets. (#6301)
* Added class methods to MGLStyle that correspond to the new [Traffic Day and Traffic Night](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/live-traffic-maps/) styles. (#6301)
* MGLSymbolStyleLayer’s `iconImageName`, `iconScale`, `textFontSize`, `textOffset`, and `textRotation` properties can now be set to a source or composite function. (#8544, #8590, #8592, #8593)
* Fixed an issue where setting the `MGLVectorStyleLayer.predicate` property failed to take effect if the relevant source was not in use by a visible layer at the time. (#8653)
* Fixed an issue preventing programmatically added style layers from appearing in already cached tiles. (#8954)
* Fixed an issue causing a composite function’s highest zoom level stop to be misinterpreted. (#8613, #8790)
* Fixed an issue where re-adding a layer that had been previously removed from a style would reset its paint properties. Moved initializers for `MGLTileSource`, `MGLStyleLayer`, and `MGLForegroundStyleLayer` to their concrete subclasses; because these classes were already intended for initialization only via concrete subclasses, this should have no developer impact. (#8626)
* Fixed a crash that occurred when removing a source that was still being used by one or more style layers. Since this is a programming error, a warning is logged to the console instead. (#9129)
* Feature querying results now account for any changes to a feature’s size caused by a source or composite style function. (#8665)
* Fixed the behavior of composite functions that specify fractional zoom level stops. (#9289)
* Letter spacing is now disabled in Arabic text so that ligatures are drawn correctly. (#9062)
* Improved the performance of styles using source and composite style functions. (#9185, #9257)

## Annotations

* Added a new initializer to `MGLAnnotationView` so that it is possible to create a new instance with an associated annotation object. (#9029)
* Added a new `rotatesToMatchCamera` property to `MGLAnnotationView` that, when set to true, causes the annotation view to rotate along with the map's rotation angle giving the appearance that the annoation view is pinned to the map. (#9147)
* Fixed an issue causing a view-backed annotation to disappear immediately instead of animating when the annotation’s `coordinate` property is set to a value outside the current viewport. (#8565)
* Fixed an issue in which `MGLMapView` overrode the tint colors of its annotation views. (#8789)
* Fixed an issue causing annotation views to persist in the map’s annotation container view even after their associated annotations were removed. (#9025)
* The `MGLPolyline.coordinate` and `MGLPolygon.coordinate` properties now return the midpoint and centroid, respectively, instead of the first coordinate. (#8713)

## User interaction

* Added a scale bar to `MGLMapView` that indicates the scale of the map. (#7631)
* Fixed an issue causing the map to go blank during a flight animation that travels a very short distance. (#9199)
* Fixed an issue where gesture recognizers associated with map view interactivity were not disabled when their related interactions were disabled. (#8304)
* Fixed an issue preventing the Mapbox Telemetry confirmation dialog from appearing when opened from within a map view in a modal view controller. (#9027)
* Corrected the size of MGLMapView’s compass. (#9060)
* The Improve This Map button in the attribution action sheet now leads to a feedback tool that matches MGLMapView’s rotation and pitch. `-[MGLAttributionInfo feedbackURLAtCenterCoordinate:zoomLevel:]` no longer respects the feedback URL specified in TileJSON. (#9078)
* `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:shouldChangeFromCamera:toCamera:]` can now block any panning caused by a pinch gesture. (#9344)
* If the user taps on the map while it is flying to the user’s location, the user dot no longer appears in the incorrect location. (#7916)
* Improved the responsiveness of the tilt gesture by reducing the initial recognition delay. (#9386)

## Other changes

* Fixed a crash that occurred when accessing the `MGLMultiPolygon.coordinate` property. (#8713)
* Fixed a crash or console spew when MGLMapView is initialized with a frame smaller than 64 points wide by 64 points tall. (#8562)
* Fixed an issue that caused the compass and scale bar to underlap navigation and tab bars. (#7716)
* The error passed into `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapViewDidFailLoadingMap:withError:]` now includes a more specific description and failure reason. (#8418)
* Improved CPU and battery performance while animating a tilted map’s camera in an area with many labels. (#9031)
* Fixed an issue rendering polylines that contain duplicate vertices. (#8808)
* Added struct boxing to `MGLCoordinateSpan`, `MGLCoordinateBounds`, `MGLOfflinePackProgress`, and `MGLTransition`. (#9343)

## Packaging

* Fixed an issue in the static framework where localizations would never load. (#9074)

## Styles

* MGLMapView and MGLTilePyramidOfflineRegion now default to version 10 of the Mapbox Streets style. Similarly, several style URL class methods of MGLStyle return URLs to version 10 styles. Unversioned variations of these methods are no longer deprecated. `MGLStyleDefaultVersion` should no longer be used with any style other than Streets. (#6301)
* Added class methods to MGLStyle that correspond to the new [Traffic Day and Traffic Night](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/live-traffic-maps/) styles. (#6301)
* Added a `light` property to MGLStyle for customizing how 3D extruded buildings are lit. (#9043)
* Fixed an issue preventing programmatically added style layers from appearing in already cached tiles. (#8954)
* Corrected the example code in the MGLFillExtrusionStyleLayer class reference. (#9059)
* Letter spacing is now disabled in Arabic text so that ligatures are drawn correctly. (#9062)

## Annotations

* Added a new initializer to `MGLAnnotationView` so that it is possible to create a new instance with an associated annotation object. (#9029)
* Fixed an issue causing annotation views to persist in the map’s annotation container view even after their associated annotations were removed. (#9025)
* The `MGLPolyline.coordinate` and `MGLPolygon.coordinate` properties now return the midpoint and centroid, respectively, instead of the first coordinate. (#8713)

## User interaction

* Fixed an issue preventing the Mapbox Telemetry confirmation dialog from appearing when opened from within a map view in a modal view controller. (#9027)
* Corrected the size of MGLMapView’s compass. ([#9060](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9060))

## Other changes

* Fixed an issue that caused the compass and scale bar to underlap navigation and tab bars. (#7716)
* Improved CPU and battery performance while animating a tilted map’s camera in an area with many labels. (#9031)
* Fixed a memory leak. (#9036)

## Styles

* Added support for 3D extrusion of buildings and other polygonal features via the `MGLFillExtrusionStyleLayer` class and the `fill-extrusion` layer type in style JSON. ([#8431](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8431))
* MGLSymbolStyleLayer’s `iconImageName`, `iconScale`, `textFontSize`, `textOffset`, and `textRotation` properties can now be set to a source or composite function. ([#8544](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8544), [#8590](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8590), [#8592](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8592), [#8593](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8593))
* Fixed an issue where setting the `MGLVectorStyleLayer.predicate` property failed to take effect if the relevant source was not in use by a visible layer at the time. ([#8653](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8653))
* Fixed an issue causing a composite function’s highest zoom level stop to be misinterpreted. ([#8613](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8613), [#8790](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8790))
* Fixed an issue where re-adding a layer that had been previously removed from a style would reset its paint properties. Moved initializers for `MGLTileSource`, `MGLStyleLayer`, and `MGLForegroundStyleLayer` to their concrete subclasses; because these classes were already intended for initialization only via concrete subclasses, this should have no developer impact. ([#8626](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8626))
* Feature querying results now account for any changes to a feature’s size caused by a source or composite style function. ([#8665](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8665))

## Annotations

* Fixed an issue causing a view-backed annotation to disappear immediately instead of animating when the annotation’s `coordinate` property is set to a value outside the current viewport. ([#8565](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8565))
* Fixed an issue in which `MGLMapView` overrode the tint colors of its annotation views. ([#8789](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8789))

## User interaction

* Added a scale bar to `MGLMapView` that indicates the scale of the map. ([#7631](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7631))
* Fixed an issue where gesture recognizers associated with map view interactivity were not disabled when their related interactions were disabled. ([#8304](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8304))

## Other changes

* Xcode 8.0 or higher is now recommended for using this SDK. ([#8775](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8775))
* Updated MGLMapView’s logo view to display [the new Mapbox logo](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/new-mapbox-logo/). ([#8771](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8771), [#8773](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8773))
* Fixed a crash or console spew when MGLMapView is initialized with a frame smaller than 64 points wide by 64 points tall. ([#8562](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8562))
* The error passed into `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapViewDidFailLoadingMap:withError:]` now includes a more specific description and failure reason. ([#8418](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8418))
* Fixed an issue rendering polylines that contain duplicate vertices. ([#8808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8808))

## Styles

* Added support for data-driven styling in the form of source and composite style functions. `MGLStyleFunction` is now an abstract class, with `MGLCameraStyleFunction` providing the behavior of `MGLStyleFunction` in previous releases. New `MGLStyleFunction` subclasses allow you to vary a style attribute by the values of attributes of features in the source. ([#7596](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7596))
* Added methods to MGLShapeSource and MGLVectorSource for querying features loaded by the source, whether or not they’re visible on the map. ([#8263](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8263))
* Added `circleStrokeColor`, `circleStrokeWidth`, and `circleStrokeOpacity` properties to MGLCircleStyleLayer and support for corresponding properties in style JSON files. ([#7356](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7356))
* Point-placed labels in symbol style layers are now placed at more optimal locations within polygons. ([#7465](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7465))
* Fixed flickering that occurred when manipulating a style layer. ([#7616](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7616))
* Symbol style layers can now render point collections (known as multipoints in GeoJSON). ([#7445](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7445))
* Added a `transition` property to MGLStyle to customize the timing of changes to style layers. ([#7711](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7711))
* Added properties to MGLStyleLayer subclasses to customize the timing of transitions between values of individual attributes. ([#8225](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8225))
* Fixed an issue causing lines and text labels toward the top of the map view to appear blurry when the map is tilted. ([#7444](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7444))
* Fixed incorrect interpolation of style functions in Boolean-typed style attributes. ([#7526](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7526))
* Removed support for the `ref` property in layers in style JSON files. ([#7586](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7586))
* Fixed an issue that collapsed consecutive newlines within text labels. ([#7446](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7446))
* Fixed artifacts when drawing particularly acute line joins. ([#7786](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7786))
* Fixed an issue in which a vector style layer predicate involving the `$id` key path would exclude all features from the layer. ([#7989](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7989), [#7971](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7971))
* Fixed an issue causing vector style layer predicates to be evaluated as if each feature had a `$type` attribute of 1, 2, or 3. The `$type` key path can now be compared to `Point`, `LineString`, or `Polygon`, as described in the documentation. ([#7971](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7971))
* When setting an `MGLShapeSource`’s shape to an `MGLFeature` instance, any `NSColor` attribute value is now converted to the equivalent CSS string representation for use with `MGLInterpolationModeIdentity` in style functions. ([#8025](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8025))
* An exception is no longer thrown if layers or sources are removed from a style before they are added. ([#7962](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7962))
* Renamed MGLStyleConstantValue to MGLConstantStyleValue. For compatibility with previous releases, MGLStyleConstantValue is now an alias of MGLConstantStyleValue. ([#8090](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8090))
* Fixed a crash that could occur when switching styles after adding an MGLSource to the style. ([#8298](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8298))

## Annotations and user interaction

* Added a method to MGLMapViewDelegate, `-mapView:shouldChangeFromCamera:toCamera:`, that you can implement to restrict which parts the user can navigate to using gestures. ([#5584](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5584))
* When a map view is the first responder, pressing <kbd>+</kbd>, <kbd>-</kbd>, or <kbd>=</kbd> now zooms the map. ([#8033](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8033))
* Changing the coordinates of a point annotation no longer deselects the annotation. ([#8269](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8269))
* Fixed an issue that could cause a crash when point annotations were added and removed while simultaneously querying source features. ([#8374](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8374))
* Fixed an issue preventing MGLMapView from adding a polyline annotation with the same coordinates as a polygon annotation. ([#8355](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8355))
* Zooming by double-tap, two-finger tap, zoom buttons, shortcut keys, or demo app menu items or shortcut keys now zooms to the nearest integer zoom level. ([#8027](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8027))
* Fixed an issue where translucent point annotations along tile boundaries would be drawn darker than expected. ([#6832](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6832))

## Networking and offline maps

* Offline pack notifications are now posted by `MGLOfflinePack` instances instead of the shared `MGLOfflineStorage` object. For backwards compatibility, the `userInfo` dictionary still indicates the pack’s state and progress. ([#7952](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7952))
* Fixed a memory leak in MGLMapView. ([#7956](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7956))
* Fixed an issue that could prevent a cached style from appearing while the computer is offline. ([#7770](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7770))

### Packaging

* The minimum deployment target for this SDK is now iOS 8. ([#8129](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8129))
* Added support for the Carthage dependency manager. See [our website](https://www.mapbox.com/ios-sdk/) for setup instructions. ([#8257](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8257))
* While running your application in the iOS Simulator, you will receive a notice in the console if a newer version of this SDK is available. ([#8282](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8282))

### Internationalization

* Added support for right-to-left text and Arabic ligatures in labels. ([#6984](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6984), [#7123](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7123))
* Improved the line wrapping behavior of point-placed labels, especially labels written in Chinese and Japanese. ([#6828](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6828), [#7446](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7446))
* CJK characters now remain upright in vertically oriented labels that have line placement, such as road labels. ([#7114](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/7114))
* Added Catalan, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese localizations. ([#7316](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7316), [#7899](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7899), [#7999](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7999), [#8113](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8113), [#8256](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8256))

### Styles

* Added support for data-driven styling in the form of source and composite style functions. `MGLStyleFunction` is now an abstract class, with `MGLCameraStyleFunction` providing the behavior of `MGLStyleFunction` in previous releases. New `MGLStyleFunction` subclasses allow you to vary a style attribute by the values of attributes of features in the source. ([#7596](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7596))
* Added methods to MGLShapeSource and MGLVectorSource for querying features loaded by the source, whether or not they’re visible on the map. ([#8263](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8263))
* Added `circleStrokeColor`, `circleStrokeWidth`, and `circleStrokeOpacity` properties to MGLCircleStyleLayer and support for corresponding properties in style JSON files. ([#7356](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7356))
* Point-placed labels in symbol style layers are now placed at more optimal locations within polygons. ([#7465](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7465))
* Fixed flickering that occurred when manipulating a style layer. ([#7616](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7616))
* Symbol style layers can now render point collections (known as multipoints in GeoJSON). ([#7445](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7445))
* Added a `transition` property to MGLStyle to customize the timing of changes to style layers. ([#7711](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7711))
* Added properties to MGLStyleLayer subclasses to customize the timing of transitions between values of individual attributes. ([#8225](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8225))
* Fixed an issue causing lines and text labels toward the top of the map view to appear blurry when the map is tilted. ([#7444](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7444))
* Fixed incorrect interpolation of style functions in Boolean-typed style attributes. ([#7526](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7526))
* Removed support for the `ref` property in layers in style JSON files. ([#7586](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7586))
* Fixed an issue that collapsed consecutive newlines within text labels. ([#7446](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7446))
* Fixed artifacts when drawing particularly acute line joins. ([#7786](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7786))
* Fixed an issue in which a vector style layer predicate involving the `$id` key path would exclude all features from the layer. ([#7989](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7989), [#7971](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7971))
* Fixed an issue causing vector style layer predicates to be evaluated as if each feature had a `$type` attribute of 1, 2, or 3. The `$type` key path can now be compared to `Point`, `LineString`, or `Polygon`, as described in the documentation. ([#7971](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7971))
* When setting an `MGLShapeSource`’s shape to an `MGLFeature` instance, any `UIColor` attribute value is now converted to the equivalent CSS string representation for use with `MGLInterpolationModeIdentity` in style functions. ([#8025](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8025))
* An exception is no longer thrown if layers or sources are removed from a style before they are added. ([#7962](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7962))
* Renamed MGLStyleConstantValue to MGLConstantStyleValue. For compatibility with previous releases, MGLStyleConstantValue is now an alias of MGLConstantStyleValue. ([#8090](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8090))
* Fixed a crash that could occur when switching styles after adding an MGLSource to the style. ([#8298](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8298))

### Annotations and user interaction

* Added a method to MGLMapViewDelegate, `-mapView:shouldChangeFromCamera:toCamera:`, that you can implement to restrict which parts the user can navigate to using gestures. ([#5584](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5584))
* Annotations are no longer deselected when the map is panned or zoomed, even if the annotation moves out of the visible bounds. ([#8022](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8022))
* Changing the coordinates of a point annotation no longer deselects the annotation. ([#8269](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8269))
* Fixed an issue that could cause a crash when point annotations were added and removed while simultaneously querying source features. ([#8374](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8374))
* Fixed an issue preventing MGLMapView from adding a polyline annotation with the same coordinates as a polygon annotation. ([#8355](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8355))
* Fixed an issue where translucent, non-view-backed point annotations along tile boundaries would be drawn darker than expected. ([#6832](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6832))
* Double-tap and two-finger tap gestures now zoom to the nearest integer zoom level. ([#8027](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8027))
* The `MGLAnnotationView.annotation` property is now read-write. ([#8139](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8139))
* Enabled the one-finger zoom gesture on iPad. To execute this gesture, tap twice; on second tap, hold your finger on the map and pan up to zoom in, or down to zoom out. ([#8379](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8379))

### Networking and offline maps

* Offline pack notifications are now posted by `MGLOfflinePack` instances instead of the shared `MGLOfflineStorage` object. For backwards compatibility, the `userInfo` dictionary still indicates the pack’s state and progress. ([#7952](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7952))
* Fixed a memory leak in MGLMapView. ([#7956](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7956))
* Fixed an issue that could prevent a cached style from appearing while the device is offline. ([#7770](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7770))
* Fixed an issue that could prevent a style from loading when reestablishing a network connection. ([#7902](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7902))
* `MGLOfflineStorage` instances now support a delegate conforming to `MGLOfflineStorageDelegate`, which allows altering URLs before they are requested from the Internet. ([#8084](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8084))

### Other changes

* Fixed an issue that, among other things, caused various islands to disappear at certain zoom levels. ([#7621](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7621))
* Added a method to MGLMapView that allows you to specify a predicate when querying for visible features. ([#8256](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8246))
* Fixed flickering that occurred when panning past the antimeridian. ([#7574](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7574))
* Fixed an issue that sometimes caused crashes when the SDK interacted with the file system in the background. ([#8125](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8125))
* Added a `MGLDistanceFormatter` class for formatting geographic distances. ([#7888](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7888))
* Fixed an issue that was causing the system location indicator to stay on in background after telemetry was disabled. ([#7833](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7833))

* Fixed an issue causing transition durations and delays to be reported in nanoseconds instead of seconds. ([#8276](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8276), [#8290](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8290))
* Added properties to MGLStyleLayer subclasses to customize the timing of transitions between values of individual attributes. ([#8225](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8225))
* Fixed a crash that could occur when switching styles after adding an MGLSource to the style. ([#8298](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8298))

## Annotations

* Changing the coordinates of a point annotation no longer deselects the annotation. ([#8269](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8269))
* Fixed an issue preventing MGLMapView from adding a polyline annotation with the same coordinates as a polygon annotation. ([#8355](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8355))
* The `MGLAnnotationView.annotation` property is now read-write. ([#8139](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8139))

## Other changes

* Fixed a crash on launch after linking against the static framework. ([#8321](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8321))
* Added a method to MGLMapView that allows you to specify a predicate when querying for visible features. ([#8256](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8246))

## Packaging
- The minimum deployment target for this SDK is now iOS 8. ([#8129](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8129))
- Fixed an issue that caused linker errors in an application using the static version of the Mapbox iOS SDK. ([#7773](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7773))
- Fixed a crash that occurred in the packaged demo app when using the locale-based language example. ([#8104](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8104))

## Internationalization
- CJK characters now remain upright in vertically oriented labels that have line placement, such as road labels. ([#7114](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/7114))
- Added Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Ukrainian localizations. [Help us add support for more languages!](https://www.transifex.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/) ([#8113](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8113))

## Styles
- Various additional properties of `MGLSymbolStyleLayer` can now be set to `MGLSourceStyleFunction` and `MGLCompositeStyleFunction` objects. ([#7944](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7944), [#7939](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7939))
- Fixed an issue preventing an `MGLCircleStyleLayer`’s stroke from drawing if its fill was transparent. ([#8078](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8078))
- When setting an `MGLShapeSource`’s shape to an `MGLFeature` instance, any `UIColor` attribute value is now converted to the equivalent CSS string representation for use with `MGLInterpolationModeIdentity` in style functions. ([#8025](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8025))
- An exception is no longer thrown if layers or sources are removed from a style before they are added. ([#7962](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7962))

## User interaction
- Annotations are no longer deselected when the map is panned or zoomed, even if the annotation moves out of the visible bounds. ([#8022](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8022))
- Double-tap and two-finger tap gestures now zoom to the nearest integer zoom level. ([#8027](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8027))

## Networking and offline maps
- Fixed an issue that sometimes caused crashes when the SDK interacted with the file system in the background. ([#8125](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8125))
- `MGLOfflineStorage` instances now support a delegate conforming to `MGLOfflineStorageDelegate`, which allows altering URLs before they are requested from the internet. ([#8084](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8084))

## Other changes
- Fixed aliased text when running on an iOS device. ([#8058](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8058))
- Fixed an issue that was causing the system location indicator to stay on in background after telemetry was disabled. ([#7833](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7833))

## Internationalization
- Added support for right-to-left text and Arabic ligatures in labels. ([#6984](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6984), [#7123](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7123))
- Improved the line wrapping behavior of point-placed labels, especially labels written in Chinese and Japanese. ([#6828](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6828), [#7446](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7446))
- Added Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), French, German, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazilian), Swedish, and Vietnamese localizations. [Help us add support for more languages](https://www.transifex.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/)! ([#7316](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7316), [#7899](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7899), [#7999](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7999))

## Styles
- Added support for data-driven styling in the form of source and composite style functions. `MGLStyleFunction` is now an abstract class, with `MGLCameraStyleFunction` providing the behavior of `MGLStyleFunction` in previous releases. New `MGLStyleFunction` subclasses allow you to vary a style attribute by the values of attributes of features in the source. ([#7596](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7596))
- Added `circleStrokeColor`, `circleStrokeWidth`, and `circleStrokeOpacity` properties to MGLCircleStyleLayer and support for corresponding properties in style JSON files. ([#7356](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7356))
- Point-placed labels in symbol style layers are now placed at more optimal locations within polygons. ([#7465](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7465))
- Fixed flickering that occurred when manipulating a style layer. ([#7616](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7616))
- Symbol style layers can now render point collections (known as multipoints in GeoJSON). ([#7445](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7445))
- Added properties to MGLStyle to delay or animate changes to style layers. ([#7711](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7711))
- Fixed an issue causing lines and text labels toward the top of the map view to appear blurry when the map is tilted. ([#7444](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7444))
- Fixed incorrect interpolation of style functions in Boolean-typed style attributes. ([#7526](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7526))
- Removed support for the `ref` property in layers in style JSON files. ([#7586](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7586))
- Fixed an issue that collapsed consecutive newlines within text labels. ([#7446](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7446))
- Fixed artifacts when drawing particularly acute line joins. ([#7786](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7786))
- Fixed an issue in which a vector style layer predicate involving the `$id` key path would exclude all features from the layer. ([#7989](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7989), [#7971](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7971))
- Fixed an issue causing vector style layer predicates to be evaluated as if each feature had a `$type` attribute of 1, 2, or 3. The `$type` key path can now be compared to `Point`, `LineString`, or `Polygon`, as described in the documentation. ([#7971](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7971))

## Networking and offline maps
- Offline pack notifications are now posted by `MGLOfflinePack` instances instead of the shared `MGLOfflineStorage` object. For backwards compatibility, the `userInfo` dictionary still indicates the pack’s state and progress. ([#7952](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7952))
- Fixed a memory leak in MGLMapView. ([#7956](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7956))
- Fixed an issue that could prevent a cached style from appearing while the device is offline. ([#7770](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7770))
- Fixed an issue that could prevent a style from loading when reestablishing a network connection. ([#7902](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7902))

## Other changes
- Fixed an issue that, among other things, caused various islands to disappear at certain zoom levels. ([#7621](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7621))
- Fixed an issue where translucent, non-view-backed point annotations along tile boundaries would be drawn darker than expected. ([#6832](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6832))
- Fixed flickering that occurred when panning past the antimeridian. ([#7574](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7574))
- Added a `MGLDistanceFormatter` class for formatting geographic distances. ([#7888](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7888))
- Added a method to MGLMapViewDelegate, `-mapView:shouldChangeFromCamera:toCamera:`, that you can implement to restrict which parts the user can navigate to using gestures. ([#5584](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5584))

- Fixed an issue where shapes that cannot currently be visually represented as annotations were still shown on the map as point annotations. ([#6764](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/6764)) 

### User location
- The user dot now animates between user locations when user tracking is disabled. ([#6215](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6215))
- To customize the appearance of the user location annotation, subclass the newly added MGLUserLocationAnnotationView class and implement `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:viewForAnnotation:]`. ([#5882](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5882))

- Fixed an issue preventing MGLAnnotationView from animating when its coordinate changes. ([#6215](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6215))
- Fixed an issue causing the wrong annotation view to be selected when tapping an annotation view with a center offset applied. ([#5931](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5931))
- Fixed an issue that assigned annotation views to polyline and polygon annotations. ([#5770](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5770))
- Fixed an issue causing the callout view to be dismissed when panning around. ([#6676](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6676))
- Per documentation, the first and last coordinates in an MGLPolygon must be identical in order for the polygon to draw correctly. The same is true for an MGLPolygon’s interior polygon. ([#5514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5514))
- To make an MGLPolyline or MGLPolygon span the antimeridian, specify coordinates with longitudes greater than 180° or less than −180°. ([#6088](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6088))

* The API reference has a sharper look. ([#7422](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7422))
* Added documentation for the Info.plist keys used by this SDK. ([#6833](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6833))

### Styles and data

* A new runtime styling API allows you to adjust the style and content of the base map dynamically. All the options available in [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/) are now exposed via MGLStyle and subclasses of MGLStyleLayer and MGLSource. ([#5727](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5727))
* MGLMapView’s `styleURL` property can now be set to an absolute file URL. ([#6026](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6026))
* When creating an MGLShapeSource, you can now specify options for clustering point features within the shape source. Similarly, GeoJSON sources specified by the stylesheet at design time can specify the `cluster`, `clusterMaxZoom`, and `clusterRadius` attributes. ([#5724](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5724))
* When creating an MGLTileSource, you can now specify that the tile URLs use [TMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service) coordinates by setting `MGLTileSourceOptionTileCoordinateSystem` to `MGLTileCoordinateSystemTMS`. TileJSON files can specify `""scheme"": ""tms""`. ([#2270](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2270))
* Fixed an issue causing abstract `MGLMultiPointFeature` objects to be returned in feature query results. Now concrete `MGLPointCollectionFeature` objects are returned. MGLMultiPointFeature is now an alias of MGLPointCollectionFeature. ([#6742](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6742))
* Fixed rendering artifacts and missing glyphs that occurred after viewing a large number of CJK characters on the map. ([#5908](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5908))

* MGLFeature’s `attributes` and `identifier` properties are now writable. ([#6728](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6728))
* Attribution views now display the correct attribution for the current style. ([#5999](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5999))
* If MGLMapView is unable to obtain or parse a style, it now calls its delegate’s `-mapViewDidFailLoadingMap:withError:` method. ([#6145](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6145))
* Added the `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:didFinishLoadingStyle:]` delegate method, which offers the earliest opportunity to modify the layout or appearance of the current style before the map view is displayed to the user. ([#6636](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6636))
* Fixed an issue causing stepwise zoom functions to be misinterpreted. ([#6328](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6328))
* A source’s tiles are no longer rendered when the map is outside the source’s supported zoom levels. ([#6345](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6345))
* Fixed crashes that could occur when loading a malformed stylesheet. ([#5736](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5736))
* Improved style parsing performance. ([#6170](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6170))
* Improved feature querying performance. ([#6514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6514))
* Fixed an issue where shapes that cannot currently be visually represented as annotations were still shown on the map as point annotations. ([#6764](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/6764))

### Annotations

* Added `showAnnotations:animated:` and `showAnnotations:edgePadding:animated:`, which moves the map viewport to show the specified annotations. ([#5749](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5749))

* Fixed an issue where placing a point annotation on Null Island also placed a duplicate annotation on its antipode. ([#3563](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3563))
* Fixed an issue that caused an assertion failure if a `MGLShapeCollection` (a GeoJSON GeometryCollection) was created with an empty array of shapes. ([#7632](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7632))
* Improved the precision of annotations at zoom levels greater than 18. ([#5517](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5517))

## Styles and data
- MGLMapView’s `style` property is now nullable in Objective-C and optional in Swift. The property is set to `nil` from the time you set the style until the style finishes loading. It is also set to `nil` if the style fails to load. In general, you should perform runtime styling operations only once you know the style has finished loading, for example in `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:didFinishLoadingStyle:]`, which provides a non-nullable (non-optional) `style` parameter. Elsewhere, to avoid repetitive optional chaining in Swift, you can unwrap the optional using a `guard let` statement. ([#7664](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7664))
- `MGLShapeSource` now has convenience initializers for arrays of features and shapes. You can use these initializers to create an `MGLShapeSource` with multiple features or shapes without first having to create a shape collection object. ([#7665](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7665))
- Renamed another batch of style layer properties ([#7603](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7603)):
  - `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.textField` to `text`
  - `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.textFont` to `textFontNames`
  - `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.textSize` to `textFontSize`
  - `MGLCircleStyleLayer.circlePitchScale` to `circleScaleAlignment`
  - `*Translate` to `*Translation`, `*TranslateAnchor` to `*TranslationAnchor`, and `MGL*TranslateAnchor` to `MGL*TranslationAnchor`
- Fixed a crash getting the `MGLForegroundStyleLayer.sourceIdentifier` property. ([#7570](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7570))
- Fixed an issue that caused MGLStyle’s `sources` and `layers` properties to be bridged to Swift as an unqualified NSMutableSet and NSMutableArray, respectively. These properties are now immutable collections but remain writable. ([#7539](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7539))
- Fixed various issues related to the `MGLVectorStyleLayer.predicate` property ([#7548](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7548)):
  - Added support for reversed comparison predicates such as `'value' = key`.
  - Fixed a crash setting it to a `CONTAINS` predicate.
  - Fixed a crash setting it to a predicate containing an inline aggregate expression such as `key IN {1, 2, 3}`.
  - Fixed a crash setting it to a predicate containing an NSSet.
  - Fixed an issue where it misinterpreted a `none` filter in the JSON stylesheet as a `NOT` predicate containing `AND` predicates.
  - Improved rendering performance after setting it to a `NOT` predicate.
  - If you set it to a `BETWEEN` predicate, you will get a `BETWEEN` predicate back.
- Fixed a crash setting the shape of a clustered MGLShapeSource to an empty MGLShapeCollectionFeature or a shape other than MGLShapeCollectionFeature. ([#7633](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7633))

## Shapes and annotations
- Added a compatibility alias from MGLMultiPointFeature to MGLPointCollectionFeature to ensure backwards compatibility with v3.3.0. ([#7540](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7540))
- An MGLShapeCollection or MGLShapeCollectionFeature can now be created without any shapes. ([#7632](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7632))
- Fixed an issue causing annotation views to stick to the left side of the map view when panning. ([#7626](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7626))
- Fixed an issue that clobbered the frame of a manually positioned custom callout view when the user panned. An MGLCalloutView implementation can now specify whether the callout view should move with the annotation as the viewport changes and whether it should automatically close when the viewport changes. ([#7646](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7646))

## Other changes
- Added several documentation guides about runtime styling, GeoJSON, annotations, and other topics. ([#7488](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7488), [#7542](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7542))
- Fixed an issue causing quotation marks to be omitted when copying example code from the documentation using Safari or Chrome. ([#7629](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7629))
- Fixed broken “View Source in GitHub” links in the documentation. ([#7569](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7569))
- Fixed a crash that could occur when sending the application to the background. ([#7672](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7672))
- Fixed an issue causing camel-cased words like “OpenStreetMap” to be miscapitalized in the attribution action sheet. ([#7651](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7651))

## Style layers
- Reversed MGLStyle’s `layers` property to be ordered back-to-front instead of front-to-back. ([#7484](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7484))
- Renamed MGLFillStyleLayer’s `fillAntialias` property and 14 properties of MGLSymbolStyleLayer to use the correct part of speech. The old names have been marked unavailable to help you find the new ones. ([#7457](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7457))
- Renamed MGLStyleFunction’s `base` property to `interpolationBase`. ([#7486](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7486))

## Map content
- Fixed a crash converting GeoJSON that contains a null property value into an MGLShape. ([#7472](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7472))
- Corrected the return type of `-[MGLShape shapeWithData:encoding:error:]` so that `init(data:encoding:)` is only available on MGLShape itself in Swift. ([#7460](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7460))
- Added a `configurationURL` property to MGLTileSource for obtaining the TileJSON file used to configure the source. ([#7398](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7398))
- Shape, feature, and annotation classes now conform to NSSecureCoding. ([#6559](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6559))

## Other changes
- Expanded documentation about shape, feature, content source, and style layer classes. ([#7475](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7475), [#7337](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7337), [#7213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7213))

## Styles
- Replaced MGLMapView’s `-style` method with a `style` property that complies to key-value coding. ([#6097](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6097))
- Added a `sources` and `layers` properties to MGLStyle for enumerating the content sources and layers in a style. ([#6097](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6097))
- Added an `-imageForName:` method to MGLStyle for accessing an existing style image. ([#7096](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7096))
- After adding a template image to the style using `-[MGLStyle setImage:forName:]`, you can now set its tint color using MGLSymbolStyleLayer’s `iconColor` property. ([#7300](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7300))
- MGLStyle raises an exception when you reuse a source or layer identifier and when you reuse an instance of MGLSource or MGLStyleLayer. ([#7227](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7227), [#7272](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7272))

## Content sources
- MGLGeoJSONSource has been renamed MGLShapeSource, and its initializers and properties have been streamlined ([#7334](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7334), [#7145](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7145)):
  - The `-initWithIdentifier:features:options:` initializer has been replaced by an `-initWithIdentifier:shape:options:` initializer that can accept any MGLShape object, not just MGLFeature objects. To create a shape source with multiple shapes, use an MGLShapeCollection or MGLShapeCollectionFeature object.
  - The `-initWithIdentifier:geoJSONData:options:` initializer has been removed. To create a shape source from GeoJSON string data, use the `+[MGLShape shapeWithData:encoding:error:]` method in conjunction with the `-[MGLShapeSource initWithIdentifier:shape:options:]` initializer. Alternatively, if performance is a concern, pass a local file URL into `-[MGLShapeSource initWithIdentifier:URL:options:]`.
  - The `geoJSONData` property has been removed. To obtain the GeoJSON representation of the shape source’s shape, use the `shape` property in conjunction with the `-[MGLShape geoJSONDataUsingEncoding:]` method.
- MGLTileSet has been removed. Instead, MGLRasterSource and MGLVectorSource are subclasses of MGLTileSource, an abstract class that has initializers and options for working with tile sets. ([#7377](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7377))
- The action sheet that appears when tapping the information button in the bottom-right corner now lists the correct attribution for the current style. ([#5999](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5999))
- An `attributionInfos` property has been added to MGLTileSource for getting the parsed attribution statements instead of the HTML source code that was previously provided by MGLTileSet’s `attribution` property. ([#7377](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7377))

## Style layers
- Added an `-insertLayer:aboveLayer:` method to MGLStyle for inserting a new layer above an existing layer. ([#6097](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6097))
- Some style layer properties have been renamed for consistency with Cocoa APIs ([#7128](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7128), [#7310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7310), [#7344](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7344)):
  - In MGLLineStyleLayer, `lineDasharray` is now `lineDashPattern`.
  - In MGLRasterStyleLayer, `rasterBrightnessMin` and `rasterBrightnessMax` are now `minimumRasterBrightness` and `maximumRasterBrightness`, respectively, and `rasterHueRotate` is now `rasterHueRotation`.
  - In MGLSymbolStyleLayer, `iconImage` is now `iconImageName`, and `iconSize` is now `iconScale`.
- Added support for the `CONTAINS` operator in style layer predicates. ([#7232](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7232))
- An exception is now raised if MGLStyleFunction is created with no stops. ([#7309](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7309))
- Various category properties on NSValue have been prefixed with the “MGL” class prefix. For example, the `lineCap` property is now named `MGLLineCapValue`. ([#7171](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7171))

## Annotations and user interaction
- Fixed an issue causing the callout view to be dismissed when panning around. ([#6676](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6676))
- Added new methods to MGLMultiPoint for replacing or deleting vertices along a polyline annotation or the exterior of a polygon annotation. ([#6565](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6565))
- The UITapGestureRecognizer on MGLMapView that is used for selecting annotations now fails if a tap does not select an annotation. ([#7246](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7246))
- Fixed an issue that sometimes caused view-backed annotations close to the edge of the map view to disappear. ([#7423](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7423))

## Other changes
- Added a `+shapeWithData:encoding:error:` method to MGLShape that deserializes GeoJSON string data into an MGLShape, MGLFeature, or MGLShapeCollectionFeature object, as well as a `-geoJSONDataUsingEncoding:` method that serializes the object back into GeoJSON string data. ([#7377](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7377))
- Various method arguments that are represented as C arrays of `CLLocationCoordinate2D` instances have been marked `const` to streamline bridging to Swift. ([#7215](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7215))
- Added a `MGLCoordinateBoundsIntersectsCoordinateBounds()` function to determine whether two MGLCoordinateBounds instances intersect one another. ([#7251](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7251))
- Fixed issues related to the visibility of sources in viewports less than 512 pixels wide or tall. ([#7438](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7438))

## Styles and data
- Fixed an issue where style enumeration values were not always translated and set correctly on `MGLStyleLayer` properties. ([#7061](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7061))

## Packaging
- Customized the documentation that comes from the Mapbox Style Specification for some  properties of `MGLSymbolStyleLayer`, `MGLLineStyleLayer`, `MGLFillStyleLayer`,  `MGLCircleStyleLayer`, and  `MGLBackgroundStyleLayer` to make it more idiomatic for Objective-C and Swift developers. ([#6107](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6107))

## Other changes
- Raster tiles such as those from Mapbox Satellite are now cached, eliminating flashing while panning back and forth. ([#7091](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7091))

## Stability and Swift compatibility
- Fixed a crash that occurred during low-memory situations when multiple instances of MGLMapView were in the view hierarchy. ([#6972](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6972))
- Notification names and user info keys are now string enumeration values for ease of use in Swift. ([#6794](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6794))

## Styles and data
- Fixed a memory leak that occurred when MGLStyleLayer instances were created and added to an MGLStyle. ([#6904](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6904))
- Changes to MGLSymbolStyleLayer’s `textField` and `iconSize` properties now take effect immediately. ([#6928](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6928), [#6932](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6932))
- Fixed a crash that occurred when removing an MGLSource or MGLStyleLayer from an MGLStyle and adding it back to the same MGLStyle or another MGLStyle. ([#7048](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7048))
- A more informative exception is raised if you attempt to add an incorrectly initialized source to an MGLStyle or remove an incorrectly initialized source or style layer from an MGLStyle. ([#7060](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7060))
- Improved the performance of symbol style layers. ([#7025](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7025))

## Annotations
- Fixed a crash panning or zooming after adding a polyline or polygon annotation to the map. ([#6888](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6888))
- Fixed a crash calling `-[MGLMapView viewForAnnotation:]` with an annotation that has not been added to the map. ([#6957](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6957))
- `-[MGLMapView viewForAnnotation:]` now returns the user location annotation view when given the user location annotation. ([#6957](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6957))
- `-[MGLMultiPoint replaceCoordinatesInRange:withCoordinates:]` now raises an exception if the range extends beyond the current array of coordinates. To append coordinates to an existing polyline or polygon, use the new `-appendCoordinates:count:` method. ([#6890](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6890))
- Fixed an issue where view-backed annotations added while panning the map could become detached from the map and cause a crash. ([#6924](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6924))
- Fixed a crash that occurred when adding the same MGLAnnotation object to the map a second time. ([#6924](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6924))

### Annotations
- Fixed an issue causing offscreen annotation views to be updated even when they were in the reuse queue. ([#5987](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5987))
- Added a method to MGLMapView that returns the annotations currently located in a particular portion of the map view’s current viewport. ([#6061](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6061))
- Fixed an issue where tapping an annotation sometimes failed to select it when the map was tilted. ([#6773](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6773))
- Fixed an issue where placing a point annotation on Null Island also placed a duplicate annotation on its antipode. ([#3563](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3563))

### Styles and data
- Fixed an issue causing the Swift compiler to require an explicit initializer to be used for shape classes. ([#6742](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6742))
- Fixed an issue causing abstract MGLMultiPointFeature objects to be returned in feature query results. Now concrete MGLPointCollectionFeature objects are returned. MGLPointCollectionFeature objects can also be added to MGLGeoJSONSource instances. ([#6742](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6742))
- MGLGeoJSONSource’s `features`, `geoJSONData`, and `URL` properties are now writable. ([#6793](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6793))
- A more informative exception is thrown if you attempt to add an incorrectly initialized style layer to an MGLStyle. ([#6738](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6738))
- Fixed an issue making it difficult to cast an MGLStyleValue to an MGLConstantStyleValue or MGLStyleFunction in Swift. ([#6824](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6824))
- MGLFeature’s `attributes` and `identifier` properties are now writable. ([#6728](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6728))
- Fixed an issue where feature querying sometimes failed to return the expected features when the map was tilted. ([#6773](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6773))

### Packaging
- Added documentation for the Info.plist keys used by this SDK. ([#6833](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6833))

### Styles and data
- Style attribute properties of MGLStyleLayer classes take MGLStyleValue objects instead of any object that conforms to the MGLStyleAttributeValue protocol, which has been removed. MGLStyleValue is a generic container class that makes sure you set a style attribute property to a value of the correct type. This fixes a crash that occurred when setting it to a value of the wrong type. ([#6601](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6601))
- The class hierarchy for style layers has been revamped. All style layer classes ultimately inherit from an abstract MGLStyleLayer class; intermediate MGLForegroundStyleLayer and MGLVectorStyleLayer classes provide additional functionality. ([#6588](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6588))
- Shortened the names of style attribute enumerations. For example, `MGLCircleStyleLayerCirclePitchScaleMap` is now `MGLCirclePitchScaleMap` in Objective-C or `MGLCirclePitchScale.map` in Swift. ([#6589](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6589))
- Shortened properties such as `layerIdentifier` on MGLStyleLayer and `sourceIdentifier` on MGLSource to simply `identifier` wherever the context is clear. ([#6588](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6588))
- Added methods to MGLStyle for managing the style’s images as UIImages. Use these methods in conjunction with MGLSymbolStyleLayer’s `iconImage` property, MGLBackgroundStyleLayer’s `backgroundPattern` property, etc. ([#6637](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6637))
- Added initializers to MGLGeoJSONSource that take MGLFeature objects directly. Removed some convenience initializers in favor of specifying a `nil` options parameter. ([#6524](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6524))
- Added a method to the MGLFeature protocol that returns a GeoJSON dictionary representation of the feature. ([#6524](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6524))
- Added an initializer to MGLMultiPoint that creates a multipoint geometry (as opposed to a polygon or polyline). ([#6524](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6524))
- Added detailed documentation about the style layer classes and MGLVectorStyleLayer’s `predicate` property. ([#6588](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6588))
- Removed an incorrect implementation of the `CONTAINS` operator for style layer predicates. ([#6590](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6590))
- Added the `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:didFinishLoadingStyle:]` delegate method, which offers the earliest opportunity to modify the layout or appearance of the current style before the map view is displayed to the user. ([#6636](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6636))
- Improved feature querying performance. ([#6514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6514))

### Annotations

**Note:** When using this release in a Swift application, you temporarily must use an explicit initializer for shape classes, e.g.,

``` swift
MGLPolyline.polyline(coordinates: &coordinates, count: UInt(coordinates.count))
```

Instead of:

``` swift
MGLPolyline(coordinates: &coordinates, count: UInt(coordinates.count))
```

This workaround will be removed in a future beta release. (https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6727, https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/5201)
- Fixed an issue that made it more difficult to select a point annotation on an untilted map by tapping the annotation. ([#6627](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6627))
- Deprecated `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:alphaForShapeAnnotation:]` in favor of specifying an alpha component via `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:strokeColorForShapeAnnotation:]` or `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:fillColorForPolygonAnnotation:]`. ([#6706](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6706))

### Styles and data
- Fixed a crash that occurred when getting or setting a style layer predicate that contains various numeric types such as `NSInteger`. ([#6290](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6290))
- A style layer’s predicate can now use the `IN` and `BETWEEN` operators, compare a property to `nil`, or always evaluate to `YES` or `NO`. ([#6405](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6405))
- Setting a layout attribute on a style layer, such as `visibility`, causes the affected map tiles to immediately redraw. ([#6201](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6201))
- Added options to MGLRasterSource and MGLVectorSource for specifying the tile sets to display and restricting the tile sets to certain zoom levels. ([#6316](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6316))
- Fixed an issue causing stepwise zoom functions to be misinterpreted. ([#6328](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6328))
- Fixed an issue causing the text inside highway shields to tilt as the map tilts. ([#6253](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6253))
- Clarified the documentation of MGLGeoJSONSource option units to help make it easier to understand the intention of these options and their effect when clustering is enabled. ([#6411](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6411))
- Some initializers have been moved from the MGLStyleLayer protocol to the appropriate classes. This fixes an issue in which the protocol declared classes that were unimplemented, leading to an uncaught exception at runtime. ([#6269](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6269))
- Fixed a crash that occurred when attempting to get a style layer or source that isn’t part of the current style. ([#6408](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6408))
- Fixed an issue causing some labels to be clipped when the map is tilted. ([#6404](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6404))
- The runtime styling API is now documented in much more detail. This documentation is now available in HTML and Dash formats. ([#6466](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6466), [#6508](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6508), [#6543](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6543), [#6447](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6447), [#6448](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6448))
- A source’s tiles are no longer rendered when the map is outside the source’s supported zoom levels. ([#6345](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6345))
- Improved style parsing performance. ([#6170](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6170))

### Annotations
- Fixed an issue that caused an annotation view to disappear if it isn’t created using the annotation view reuse queue. ([#6485](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6485))
- Fixed an issue preventing the map from scrolling to the correct center coordinate when a user tracking mode is enabled and the user location annotation has a vertical alignment other than `MGLAnnotationVerticalAlignmentCenter`. ([#6313](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6313), [#6566](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6566))
- Fixed an issue preventing cached annotation images from displaying while the device is offline. ([#6358](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6358))
- MGLPolyline annotations and the exterior coordinates of MGLPolygon annotations are now able to be mutated, part or all, and changes are displayed immediately. ([#6565](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6565))

### Networking and offline maps
- Reverted performance improvements to the offline and ambient cache database, which were added in alpha 3, due to stability issues. ([#6320](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6320))
- Fixed an issue preventing an MGLMapView from loading tiles while an offline pack is downloading. ([#6446](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6446))
- Fixed a crash that could occur when the device is disconnected while downloading an offline pack. ([#6293](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6293))
- Fixed a crash that occurred when encountering a rate-limit error in response to a network request. ([#6223](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6223))
- Fixed an issue causing an MGLOfflinePack’s progress to continue to update after calling `-suspend`. ([#6186](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6186))
- Query parameters are no longer stripped from mapbox: URLs used as resource URLs. ([#6182](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6182), [#6432](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6432))
- Database errors are now logged to the console. ([#6291](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6291))

### Packaging
- Fixed an issue with symbols not being properly stripped from the dynamic framework. The dSYM file included with the standard dynamic framework in previous releases could not be used to symbolicate crashes. ([#6531](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6531))

- A `predicate` property on each MGLStyleLayer subclass allows you to access and modify the NSPredicate object that determines which source features are included in the layer. The predicate corresponds to the `filter` property in the stylesheet. ([#6049](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6049))
- Added options for clustering point features to MGLGeoJSONSource. ([#6217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6217))

This warning will become an exception in a future release. ([#6163](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6163))
- `-[MGLMapView resetPosition]` now resets to the current style’s default center coordinates, zoom level, direction, and pitch, if specified. ([#6127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6127))
- If MGLMapView is unable to obtain or parse a style, it now calls its delegate’s `-mapViewDidFailLoadingMap:withError:` method. ([#6145](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6145))
- Properties of MGLStyleLayer subclasses that represent optional style attributes are now `null_resettable` in Objective-C and implicitly unwrapped optionals in Swift. ([#6168](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6168))
- Fixed issues getting and setting enumeration-typed properties in MGLStyleLayer subclasses. ([#6168](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6168))
- Fixed issues getting and setting padding properties in MGLStyleLayer subclasses. ([#6168](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6168))
- Heading accuracy indicator sizing has been changed to appear more precise. ([#6120](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6120))
- Fixed an issue causing changes to certain styles via the runtime styling API to be reverted after a certain amount of time. The runtime styling API now disables any automatic style reloading triggered by HTTP caching headers. ([#5753](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5753))
- Fixed an issue that could reset user-added transformations on annotation views. ([#6166](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6166))
- Improved offline and ambient cache database performance. ([#5796](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5796))

### General
- Xcode 7.3 or above is required for using this SDK. ([#6059](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/6059))
- To customize the appearance of the user location annotation, subclass the newly added MGLUserLocationAnnotationView class and implement `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:viewForAnnotation:]`. ([#5882](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5882))
- To make an MGLPolyline or MGLPolygon span the antimeridian, specify coordinates with longitudes greater than 180° or less than −180°. ([#6088](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6088))
- MGLMapView’s `styleURL` property can now be set to an absolute file URL. ([#6026](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6026))
- Added support for `""scheme"": ""tms""` in TileJSON descriptions. ([#2270](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2270))
- Fixed an issue causing the user dot’s accuracy ring to wobble while zooming in and out. ([#6019](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6019))
- Fixed a typo in the documentation for the MGLCompassDirectionFormatter class. ([#5879](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5879))

### Runtime styling
- Removed `-[MGLBaseStyleLayer update]`. Changes to layers now take effect immediately. ([#6018](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6018))
- MGLGeoJSONSource can now be initialized with an NSData object representing GeoJSON source code. A `geoJSONData` property replaces the `data` property. ([#6029](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6029))
- New `features` and `URL` properties on MGLGeoJSONSource allow you to access the data from which the source was created. ([#6029](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6029))
- Added `-[MGLStyle sourceWithIdentifier:]` to get a source by its identifier. ([#5980](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5980))
- Removed the `sourceType` property from MGLSource. To distinguish between different kinds of sources, use `-[NSObject isKindOfClass:]`. ([#6028](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6028))
- MGLMapView methods for managing style classes have been deprecated in favor of similar methods in MGLStyle. ([#5980](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5980))
- Removed the unimplemented `functionType` property from MGLStyleAttributeFunction.  ([#5980](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5980))

- A new runtime styling API allows you to adjust the style and content of the base map dynamically. All the options available in [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/) are now exposed via MGLStyle and subclasses of MGLStyleLayer and MGLSource. ([#5727](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5727))
- Simulator architecture slices are included in the included dSYM file, allowing you to symbolicate crashes that occur in the Simulator. ([#5740](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5740))
- As the user zooms in, tiles from lower zoom levels are scaled up until tiles for higher zoom levels are loaded. ([#5143](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5143))
- Fixed an issue causing the wrong annotation view to be selected when tapping an annotation view with a center offset applied. ([#5931](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5931))
- Fixed an issue allowing annotation views to be assigned to polyline and polygon annotations. ([#5770](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5770))
- Per documentation, the first and last coordinates in an MGLPolygon must be identical in order for the polygon to draw correctly. The same is true for an MGLPolygon’s interior polygon. ([#5514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5514))
- GeoJSON sources specified by the stylesheet at design time now support `cluster`, `clusterMaxZoom`, and `clusterRadius` attributes for clustering point features on the base map. ([#5724](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5724))
- Added [quadkey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx) support and limited WMS support in raster tile URL templates. ([#5628](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5628))

- The `text-pitch-alignment` property is now supported in stylesheets for improved street label legibility on a tilted map. ([#5288](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5288))
- The `icon-text-fit` and `icon-text-fit-padding` properties are now supported in stylesheets, allowing the background of a shield to automatically resize to fit the shield’s text. ([#5334](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5334))
- The `circle-pitch-scale` property is now supported in stylesheets, allowing circle features in a tilted base map to scale or remain the same size as the viewing distance changes. ([#5576](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5576))
- The `identifier` property of an MGLFeature may now be either a number or string. ([#5514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5514))
- Improved the performance of relocating a non-view-backed point annotation by changing its `coordinate` property. ([#5385](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5385))
- Improved the precision of annotations at zoom levels greater than 18. ([#5517](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5517))
- Fixed crashes that could occur when loading a malformed stylesheet. ([#5736](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5736))
- Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred when initializing an MGLMapView. ([#5932](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5932))
- MGLMapDebugOverdrawVisualizationMask no longer has any effect in Release builds of the SDK. This debug mask has been disabled for performance reasons. ([#5555](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5555))

- Fixed a crash that occurred when a style or other resource URL has a query string. ([#5554](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5554))
- If you subclass MGLAnnotationView, your implementation of `-setSelected:animated:` is now called with the correct value in the `animated` parameter, making it possible to animate a deselection. ([#5677](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5677))
- The compass, Mapbox logo, and attribution button now accommodate the containing map view’s content insets. If your interface elements partially overlap the map view but do not affect the top and bottom layout guides, set the `automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets` property to `NO` and set the `contentInset` property to a suitable value. ([#5671](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5671))
- Added a property to MGLOfflineStorage, `countOfBytesCompleted`, that indicates the disk space occupied by all cached and offline resources. ([#5585](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5585))

## Styles and data
- Added methods to MGLMapView for obtaining the underlying map data rendered by the current style, along with additional classes to represent complex geometry in that data. ([#5110](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5110))
- Improved performance viewing regions with large landcover polygons when viewing a style that uses the Mapbox Streets source. ([#2444](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2444))
- Fixed a memory leak when using raster resources. ([#5141](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5141))
- Rendering now occurs on the main thread, fixing a hang when calling `-[MGLMapView styleURL]` before the map view has fully loaded or while the application is in the background. ([#2909](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2909))
- Added a `-reloadStyle:` action to MGLMapView to force a reload of the current style. ([#4728](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4728))
- A more specific user agent string is now sent with style and tile requests. ([#4012](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4012))
- Added a new option to `MGLMapDebugMaskOptions`, `MGLMapDebugOverdrawVisualizationMask`, that highlights overlapping drawing operations instead of the usual rendered output. ([#5403](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5403))

## Interactivity
- The compass, user dot, and visible annotations are now accessible to VoiceOver users. ([#1496](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/1496))
- Added a method to MGLMapView, `-anchorPointForGesture:`, that you can override to anchor gestures at a point other than the user location. ([#5302](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5302))
- Added a property to MGLMapView, `decelerationRate`, that allows you to speed up or slow down the drift animation at the end of a user gesture. You can also use this property to disable the drift animation entirely. ([#5504](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5504))
- Improved responsiveness when zooming in then immediately panning around. ([#4595](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4595))
- Added a new method, `-[MGLMapView cameraThatFitsCoordinateBounds:]`, to get a camera that you can pass into `-setCamera:` that fits the given coordinate bounds. ([#4790](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4790))

## Annotations
- MGLPointAnnotation and custom MGLAnnotation implementations (but not MGLMultiPoint) can be backed by an MGLAnnotationView instead of an MGLAnnotationImage. MGLAnnotationView is a subclass of UIView, so you can use Core Animation and other familiar technologies with it. To associate an MGLAnnotation with an MGLAnnotationView, implement `-mapView:viewForAnnotation:` in your MGLMapViewDelegate class. ([#4801](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4801))
- An MGLAnnotation can be relocated by changing its `coordinate` property in a KVO-compliant way. An MGLMultiPoint cannot be relocated. ([#3835](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3835))
- Setting the `image` property of an MGLAnnotationImage to `nil` resets it to the default red pin image and reclaims resources that can be used to customize additional annotations. ([#3835](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3835))
- An MGLPolygon can now have interior polygons, representing holes knocked out of the overall shape. ([#5110](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5110))

## User location
- The user dot now moves smoothly between user location updates while user location tracking is disabled. ([#1582](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/1582))
- Fixed an issue preventing KVO change notifications from being generated on MGLMapView’s `userTrackingMode` key path when `-setUserTrackingMode:animated:` is called. ([#4724](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4724))
- Fixed a crash setting MGLMapView’s `userLocationVerticalAlignment` property before a user location update has occurred. ([#5278](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5278))
- Mapbox Telemetry is automatically disabled while the host application is running in the iOS Simulator. ([#4726](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4726))

## Offline maps
- `MGLOfflinePackProgress` now indicates how many tiles have been downloaded and how much space they take up. ([#4874](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4874))
- Fixed an issue where the tile cache could be included in iCloud backups on the first launch. ([#5124](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5124), [#5601](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5601))
- Suppressed “Unable to make space for entry” console spew. ([#4708](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4708))
- Deprecated `-[MGLMapView emptyMemoryCache]`. ([#4725](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4725))

## Packaging
- Improved the design of the generated API documentation. ([#5306](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5306))
- Applications linking against the SDK static framework no longer need to add `-ObjC` to the Other Linker Flags (`OTHER_LDFLAGS`) build setting. If you previously added this flag solely for this SDK, removing the flag may potentially reduce the overall size of your application. ([#4641](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4641))
- Removed the `armv7s` slice from the SDK to reduce its size. iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c automatically use the `armv7` slice instead. ([#4641](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4641))
- The SDK is now localizable. No localizations are currently provided, other than English, but if you need a particular localization, you can install the SDK manually and drop a .lproj folder into the framework. ([#4783](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4783))
- Removed unused SVG files from the SDK’s resource bundle. ([#4641](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4641))

## Other changes
- Added category methods on NSValue for converting to and from the structure types defined in MGLGeometry.h. ([#4802](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4802))
- Added NSFormatter subclasses for converting geographic coordinates and directions into display strings. ([#4802](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4802))
- Added `MGLCoordinateInCoordinateBounds()`, a function that tests whether or not a coordinate is in a given bounds. ([#5053](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5053))

- Fixed an issue causing MGLAnnotationView’s `mapView` property to sometimes be `nil` when MGLMapView calls `-[MGLAnnotationView setCenter:]` to position the annotation view. ([#5647](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5647))
- Reorganized the table of contents in the reference documentation. ([#5660](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5660))

- Added support for full Bitcode builds so that you can archive your application with Bitcode enabled for submission to the App Store via iTunes Connect. ([#5586](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5586))
- Removed `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:didDragAnnotationView:toCoordinate:]`. A drag operation on an annotation view automatically moves the associated annotation when the user lifts their finger. To cancel a drag, set the annotation view’s `dragState` property to `MGLAnnotationViewDragStateCanceling`. ([#5561](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5561))
- Fixed an issue in which stroked polygons in the base map were drawn with an incomplete outline. ([#5591](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/5591), [#5596](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5596))
- Included CocoaPods podspecs to simplify installing the dynamic framework as a local development pod. ([#5569](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5569))
- Telemetry data is compressed to further reduce mobile data usage. ([#5490](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5490))

- Improved the design of the generated API documentation. ([#5306](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5306))
- Fixed a crash on iOS 8.1 and below when initializing an MGLMapView. ([#5497](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5497))
- Draggable annotations no longer leave a dangling callout view visible when the dragging event starts. Also, draggable annotations now always trigger their associated map view delegate callbacks. ([#5496](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5496))
- The double-tap-drag gesture, which lets the user zoom the map with one finger, no longer drags draggable annotation views. ([#5506](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5506))
- Removed the `flat` property from MGLAnnotationView. ([#5546](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5546))

- The position of a view-backed annotation can be animated implicitly using Core Animation. ([#5550](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5550))
- Fixed an issue where certain actions that trigger map events (i.e., updates from UIScrollView) were not processed by the run loop until the thread was idle. ([#5503](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5503))
- Removed `-[MGLAnnotationView isScaledWithViewingDistance]`. Use the `scalesWithViewingDistance` instead. ([#5545](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5545))
- Fixed an issue causing an annotation view to be scaled based on a pitch of 0° when setting the view’s center offset, even when the map is tilted. ([#5550](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5550))
- Fixed KVO compliance for MGLAnnotationView’s `center`, `centerOffset`, and `scalesWithViewingDistance` properties. These properties now take effect immediately. ([#5550](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5550))
- Improved MGLMapViewDelegate and MGLAnnotationView documentation. ([#5545](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5545))

- MGLPointAnnotation and custom MGLAnnotation implementations (but not MGLMultiPoint) can be backed by an MGLAnnotationView instead of an MGLAnnotationImage. MGLAnnotationView is a subclass of UIView, so you can use Core Animation and other familiar technologies with it. To associate an MGLAnnotation with an MGLAnnotationView, implement `-mapView:viewForAnnotation:` in your MGLMapViewDelegate class. ([#4801](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4801))
  - An MGLAnnotationView can be repositioned in relation to the associated MGLAnnotation.coordinate by changing its `centerOffset` property. ([#5059](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5062))
  - An MGLAnnotationView can be rotated to match the rotation pitch of the associated map view. ([#5067](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5067))

- If you’ve previously installed the SDK as a static framework, the installation workflow has changed to address issues when submitting your application to the App Store or installing it on a device. Upon upgrading to this version of the SDK, you’ll need to add Mapbox.bundle to the Copy Bundle Resources build phase and remove Mapbox.framework from the Embed Frameworks build phase.

- Tiles and other resources are cached in the same file that holds offline resources. The combined cache file is located in a subdirectory of the user’s Application Support directory, which means iOS will not delete the file when disk space runs low.

- If you’ve previously installed the SDK as a static framework, the installation workflow has changed to address issues when submitting your application to the App Store or installing it on a device. Upon upgrading to this version of the SDK, you’ll need to add Mapbox.bundle to the Copy Bundle Resources build phase and remove Mapbox.framework from the Embed Frameworks build phase. ([#4455](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4455))
- `-[MGLOfflineStorage getPacksWithCompletionHandler:]` has been removed. The shared MGLOfflineStorage object’s `packs` property contains all valid offline packs. The array is populated in the background shortly after the application launches. To find out when a pack is added or removed, use completion handlers or key-value observing (KVO). ([#4482](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4482))
- MGLOfflinePackDelegate has been removed. To receive progress updates about any offline pack, use NSNotificationCenter or KVO. Your code no longer needs to capture a strong reference to a pack to receive progress updates about it. ([#4482](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4482))
- Fixed a crash that occurred when removing an offline pack that was actively downloading resources. ([#4410](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4410))
- The cache file in Application Support, which stores cached resources for both offline packs and general caching, is excluded from device backups to avoid contributing to storage limits. ([#4493](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4493))
- Fixed an issue where the map view’s center would always be calculated as if the view occupied the entire screen. ([#4504](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/4504))
- The maximum zoom level is capped at 21 due to rendering issues at higher zoom levels. ([#4417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4417))

- The SDK is now distributed as a dynamic framework instead of a static library, resulting in a simpler installation workflow and significantly reduced download size. The framework contains both simulator and device content. If you install the dynamic framework manually, you’ll need to strip out the simulator content before submitting your application to the App Store due to [an Xcode bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216); see the installation instructions included with the framework for details.

- `MGLMapView` methods that alter the viewport now accept optional completion handlers. ([#3090](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3090))
- You can now modify an annotation’s image after adding the annotation to the map. ([#3146](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3146))
- Tapping now selects annotations more reliably. Tapping near the top of a large annotation image now selects that annotation. An annotation image’s alignment insets influence how far away the user can tap and still select the annotation. For example, if your annotation image has a large shadow, you can keep that shadow from being tappable by excluding it from the image’s alignment rect. ([#3261](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3261))
- Annotations remain visible after switching to a different style. ([#3049](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3049))
- The minimum and maximum zoom levels can now be configured using the `minimumZoomLevel` and `maximumZoomLevel` properties, respectively. The map is no longer limited to zoom level 18: by default, the maximum zoom level is now 20, allowing for a more detailed map in urban areas. ([#3712](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3712))
- A new method on MGLMapView, `-flyToCamera:withDuration:completionHandler:`, lets you transition between viewpoints along an arc as if by aircraft. ([#3171](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3171), [#3301](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3301))
- MGLMapCamera’s `altitude` values now match those of MKMapCamera. ([#3362](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3362))
- MGLMapView properties like `centerCoordinate` and `camera` now offset the center to account for any translucent top or bottom bar. As a result, when user tracking is enabled and the map view is an immediate child of a view controller, the user dot is centered in the unobscured portion of the map view. To override this offset, modify the `contentInset` property; you may also need to set the containing view controller’s `automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets` property to `NO`. ([#3583](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3583))
- In user tracking mode, the user dot stays in a fixed position within MGLMapView while the map pans smoothly. A new property, `userLocationVerticalAlignment`, determines the user dot’s fixed position. ([#3589](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3589))
- When the user tracking mode is set to `MGLUserTrackingModeFollowWithCourse`, an optional `targetCoordinate` is kept within sight at all times as the user changes location. This property, in conjunction with the `userLocationVerticalAlignment` property, may be useful for displaying the user’s progress toward a waypoint. ([#3680](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3680))
- Heading or course tracking mode can now be enabled as soon as an MGLMapView is initialized. ([#3680](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3680))
- Zooming and rotation gestures no longer disable user tracking mode. ([#3589](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3589))
- User tracking mode starts out at a lower zoom level by default. ([#3589](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3589))
- Fixed an issue with small map views not properly fitting annotations within bounds. (#[3407](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3407))
- When the user rotates the map to within 7° of true north, the map view now snaps to true north. ([#3403](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3403))
- The map view’s background can now be transparent or translucent, as long as the style’s background layer is transparent or translucent and `MGLMapView.opaque` is set to `NO`. ([#3096](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3096))
- Documentation is now generated by [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) instead of appledoc. ♪♫ ([#3203](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3203))
- New API to provide a custom callout view to the map for annotations. ([#3456](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3456))
- Made telemetry on/off setting available in-app. ([#3445](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3445))
- Fixed an issue with users not being counted by Mapbox if they had disabled telemetry. ([#3495](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3495))
- Fixed crash caused by MGLAnnotationImage with non-integer width or height ([#2198](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/2198))
- Fixed “include of non-modular header” errors in Swift projects managed by CocoaPods. ([#3679](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3679)) 
- Avoids triggering the blue background location status bar when user has granted ""when in use"" permission. ([#3671](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/3671))
- Deprecated the `debugActive` property and `-toggleDebug` method on MGLMapView in favor of a new `debugMask` property that exposes individual style debugging options. ([#3742](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3742))

- The SDK is now distributed as a dynamic framework instead of a static library, resulting in a simpler installation workflow and significantly reduced download size. The framework contains both simulator and device content; due to [an Xcode bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216), you’ll need to strip out the simulator content before submitting your application to the App Store. ([#3183](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3183))
- Fixed an issue causing the entire MGLMapView to leak. ([#3447](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3447))
- `MGLMapView` methods that alter the viewport now accept optional completion handlers. ([#3090](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3090))
- You can now modify an annotation’s image after adding the annotation to the map. ([#3146](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3146))
- Tapping now selects annotations more reliably. Tapping near the top of a large annotation image now selects that annotation. An annotation image’s alignment insets influence how far away the user can tap and still select the annotation. For example, if your annotation image has a large shadow, you can keep that shadow from being tappable by excluding it from the image’s alignment rect. ([#3261](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3261))
