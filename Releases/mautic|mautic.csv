Editor improvements: The editor has received an overhaul to make it easier to use and more flexible. New slots are available to enable the user to easily create different types of content such as images, text, social follows,  and gated video. Also, multi column sections have been made available so that the user can have more flexibility in designing their page or email.

Improvements to SF integration: A new interface for mapping fields  between Mautic and Salesforce is now available. You can also specify which system is the master for each mapped field ie if you determine phone number can only ever be updated in Salesforce, this data will flow from SF to Mautic and not the other way around post initial creation.

1. Marketing Messages: A new item is available under the channels menu - Marketing Messages. A user can specify what a message would look like across channels such as email, web notification, text message and social (twitter). When using the ‘send marketing message’ action as part of a campaign, the campaign will determine which channel to send the message via, using the contact’s specified preferences. This ensures contacts are receiving messages via their preferred channel.  If the contact has not specified a preferred channel, email will be the default channel. If the frequency limit on the preferred channel is reached or the preferred channel is paused, the message will be sent via the next channel the contact has opted into based on the channel with the highest frequency allowed.
2. Campaign Reporting: Users can now view metrics on the performance of individual components and channels in the context of a campaign. What this means is that users can create reports to view data on the performance of the campaign as a whole. A new data source called Campaigns is now available in the reporting area.

### Integrations

Citrix: We have added 4 new plugins to integrate data from Citrix into Mautic. These include GotoMeeting, GotoWebinar, GotoAssist and GotoTraining. Users can now create registrants in the Citrix tools from form data in Mautic. They can pull registrant and attendee data back from the Citrix tools into Mautic and trigger campaigns based on this data. The registration and attendance data is also stored as part of the contact’s timeline in Mautic.

FullContact: FullContact is a data enhancement tool that provides social and demographic data for contacts. Users of FullContact can now enhance their contact and company data in Mautic by clicking a button on the contact (or company) and bringing in data from FullContact.

ClearBit: ClearBit is also a data enhancement tool. Social and demographic data about contacts and companies can be brought into Mautic using this new plugin.

Enhancements to SF integration: Data from Salesforce Accounts can now be synched with Companies in Mautic. In addition we have optimized the API to minimize the number of API calls Mautic makes. Data from a new field type – formula fields  – is available for mapping data between Salesforce and Mautic. Lastly a user of Salesforce can now access the timeline for the contact in Mautic by clicking on a link on the page in Salesforce.

### Contacts

Preference Center: Users can now collect preferences for their contacts and get more data on how their contacts want to be reached. They can collect information about the contact’s preferred channels, categories, timings, and segments. This will help them deliver more relevant messages, using channels the contact prefers hence minimizing the number of contacts unsubscribing altogether from their communications. This provides the foundation required for some cool future features around contact communication.

Account Based Marketing: We have added a number of new features to Account Based Marketing. Companies in Mautic can now be merged. You can easily change the primary company on a contact. You can score at the company level. And a new set of reports are available to measure performance at the company level.

Global Categories: Users can specify global categories across emails, landing pages, stages etc to categorize entities in Mautic. This is a simplification so that the user does not need to define categories individually for each entity in Mautic. These categories can be used in combination with the new preference center to allow a contact to choose what types of communication they receive. A new segment filter supports a contact's subscribed categories.

### Security

This release addresses a security vulnerability in the API - all are recommended to update. (Thank you @MaxWebmecanik)

### Feature Highlights

Dynamic Email Content: Users now have the ability to vary content in their email based on filters. Instead of creating multiple emails for slightly different messages, users can now save time by creating one email and can insert variations of content into the email. The content will be dynamic at the time of sending the email.

Account Based Marketing: A new entity has been created called ‘Companies’. Every contact will be associated to a Company and users will now have an all-company view of contacts. This means they will be able to see all contacts associated with a company, create filters and trigger actions based on company criteria. Marketers can now focus on nurturing, analyzing and converting a targeted group of accounts (or Companies) to implement Account Based Marketing.

Recency/Frequency: For contacts subject to frequency limits, emails sent to them are now put in a queue to send once the limit timeframe has passed. Users can specify the priority on marketing emails to prevent backlogs and ensure important messages are sent in a timely manner.

Update to forms – The form experience has been vastly improved. Users can now successfully pick a theme to apply to a form. In addition, results of a campaign form can be sent to a specified email address. Page breaks have been added to make forms more digestible to the contact filling out the form. Data from one form can be written to another. Syncing data between contact fields and forms has also been upgraded – changes made to contact fields can be easily written to forms; values from a form can be transformed and written to contact fields. Users also have the ability to further personalize thank you pages using tokens.

New Plugins: Two plugins have been created for this release. The first is the Gmail plugin. This is a Chrome and Firefox plugin that shows timeline data from Mautic right in the browser. Also, when writing an email to an individual, the email can be tracked and written to the contact’s timeline in Mautic by clicking a little checkbox. The second plugin is the Outlook plugin. Emails sent from Outlook can be written to and tracked in Mautic. Check these out!

This is a very important bug fix release. We squashed a lot of stinking bugs! But more so, we found an unexploited security vulnerability which means immediate update for any using 2.1.0 is highly recommended. 

There are a couple things you should know about this release. 
1. Security vulnerability - this release closes a critical security vulnerability that only affects those running 2.1.0. A CVE ID is pending but we did not want to wait till that process completes before releasing the fix. Details will be made known through the CVE. Upgrade and you will be safe.
2. There was a bug that affected building segments if an _OR_ filter was used. Basically any _OR_ caused the previous _AND_ to act as an _OR_. Confusing? Yea it's confusing. The good news is that we fixed it and your segments should be corrected. The potentially bad news is that if you were using an _OR_ statement, this correction may change the membership which may then affect campaigns and communication as well. Each _OR_ will start a new group of _ANDs_ so we made this intended relationship a little more visual: ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/718028/17753607/95ced620-649e-11e6-954e-a617c6b4d462.png)

3869286,2016-08-11T19:54:22Z,2016-08-11T19:57:19Z,2.1.0,"## Notes

This release includes schema changes to the leads and page_hits tables. If your installation is large with a lot of data in these tables - please consider using CLI to upgrade rather than the UI. Add https://github.com/mautic/mautic/blob/master/upgrade.php to your Mautic root, navigate to the root through CLI, and run `php upgrade.php`.

## Feature Highlights

Custom Themes: Users now have the ability to upload and use their own custom themes in addition to the standard ones available within Mautic. Users can create a theme/template that represents their brand just once and use it over and over again when creating an email or a landing page. Administrator users can upload, download, view or delete themes by accessing the theme menu item in the settings area. All users on the account can access the custom themes from the theme selection area while building new emails and landing pages.

Multi lingual dynamic content on emails and landing pages: A preferred language can now automatically be associated with a contact based on the language settings on their browser. In Mautic, the user can translate a page or email into various languages and can link the different versions together. The page or email is then dynamically displayed in the language of the contact if a translation exists. The default language of a contact can also be set manually. This feature enables contacts to view information in their preferred language.

Campaign builder refactor: The campaign builder has has gotten a usability uplift! A list of available actions are displayed on clicking on the ‘+’ for each campaign item making it more efficient to use the campaign builder.

Progressive Profiling: Forms now have dynamic fields. When serving up a form, information that the system already knows about the contact can be hidden and alternate form fields can be displayed in their place. This ensures that the contact is only asked for a limited amount of information every time they fill out a form. This reduces the likelihood of them abandoning the form part of the way through.

Recency Frequency and Touch Management: The administrator can set limits on the maximum number of times a contact can receive a message via a particular channel. Limits can be set per channel, system wide for all contacts and can also be overwritten at the individual contact level. This feature helps mitigate contact fatigue and ensures users in the system are not over communicating with their contacts.

New UI for timeline activities: The UI has been changed to a tabular format to make it easier to consume and filter activities on the contact record.
Reporting and Tracking

Reporting on SMS and web: Details such as the creator, date and category are now tracked for the SMS and Web notification channels. This enables better understanding and visibility of the content sent through these channels.

Device Granularity: The user can now see which devices contacts are using to view their emails and landing pages. Two new dashboard widgets have been created to show device usage by segment and by channel. The widgets show a breakdown of usage on devices such as a tablet, mobile or desktop. The device  information is also available as part of the metrics for each email/landing page. It is also available on the contact timeline and in reports for analysis. This feature enables users to understand what devices their contacts are using to consume information.
Integrations

Expand Salesforce Integration: The integration to Salesforce has been expanded beyond the existing bi-directional sync with leads which was rolled out in R2.0. Now, information from Contacts in Salesforce can be mapped back to contacts in Mautic. In addition timeline activity from the contact is Mautic can be written to the Lead or Contact record in Salesforce. This enables sales users in Salesforce to see what marketing activities the record has interacted with.

Video integration: Video integration is here! Users can insert videos from Vimeo or YouTube or any other mp4 platforms onto landing pages with a gate. This means the user can require a contact to fill out a form after the video has played for a predefined period of time. Video consumption metrics including time viewed and percent of the video watched are also available on the contact’s timeline.

### IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ BEFORE UPGRADING

The PHP minimum version is now 5.6.19. We decided to drop PHP 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5 support since the [PHP project itself no longer supports them](http://php.net/supported-versions.php) (5.5 is end of life as of July 11, 2016). We are also now able to support PHP 7! Prior to PHP 5.6.19, there [was a bug in PDO MySQL](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71569) (which Mautic uses by default) and thus the reason for a PHP minimum of 5.6.19.

 The MySQL minimum version is now 5.5.3 in order to plan for MySQL's support of the utf8mb4 encoding in future releases (to support emoji's natively). PostgreSQL support has been dropped in order to be able to focus on optimization of Mautic data.

If your server does not meet these requirements, please upgrade to the minimums before upgrading Mautic. You can check your current versions by going to the admin menu in Mautic (the cogwheel upper right hand side) then to System Info

This release brings some schema changes that could impact how quickly an upgrade takes. This means that if you have a large number of leads, you should NOT upgrade through Mautic's upgrade UI. Instead you should update through the command line. However, 2.0 brought some backwards compatibility issues with our upgrade process due to changes in dependencies. Our CLI command, `php app/console mautic:update:apply` **WILL NOT WORK**. We have provided an upgrade script to use instead. Please download this script from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mautic/mautic/master/upgrade.php](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mautic/mautic/master/upgrade.php), place in the root of your Mautic installation, and run it from CLI with `php upgrade.php`. It will fetch 2.0.0 and proceed to upgrade your Mautic installation.

If you have a relatively small dataset, feel free to use the UI instead. 

#### Highlighted Features

##### Froala editor

This release switches CKEditor in favor of Froala editor which has a more polished look and functionality. We love it and hope you do too!
![](http://alan.direct/drop/2016-07-01_14-13-48.png)

#### New email and page builders!

Email and page builders have been overhauled to be cleaner and better. This means that custom themes have changed as well. We've added a bunch of built-in themes from https://www.sendwithus.com/resources/templates.
![](http://alan.direct/drop/2016-07-01_14-12-21.png)

#### Terminology Changes

One of the first things you'll notice with this release is that we changed a few words to match that of the industry. Leads, lead lists and lead fields haven't been removed, we just renamed them :-) What we originally called `leads`, we are now calling `contacts`. And what we were our `lead lists` are now known as `segments`. 

#### Menu Changes

You'll also notice new items in the menu. Here is a quick list of the new order/items:

Leads -> Manage Leads = Contacts
Leads -> Manage Lists = Segments
Leads -> Manage Fields was moved to the admin menu as Custom Fields
Assets, Forms, Landing Pages are now under Components
Emails are now under Channels along with new channels for this release

## Feature Highlights

This release includes several exciting features!

#### Configurable Dashboard

The dashboard is now configurable with widgets. Each user can configure their own dashboard with only the data they are interested in. Share layouts between users or with others by exporting and importing layouts. Or save several different layouts for different purposes.

#### SMS and Web Channels

We now integrate with Twilio and One Signal. Using your own Twilio or One Signal accounts, you can now send contacts text messages through a campaign or push a notification to their browser (with the contacts permission).Enable these in Mautic's Configuration to see them listed under Channels in the menu.

#### Form Social Single Sign On

We now have a Social Login form field that allows you to embed social buttons into your form. A contact can use their social profile to automatically fill in the form. Social profile details will be added to the contact's profile (if allowed by the contact). Note that you must setup the developer accounts and apps with supported social networks to use this feature.

#### Javascript Based Tracking

Good-bye tracking pixel! Well not really; it's still around. But we now also have a javascript based tracking option. Go to the Configuration to grab your tracking code. 
![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1235442/15040273/b782cd40-12b3-11e6-88d3-bf5a8386dcea.png)

You can update the tracking code to append custom parameters (just like the tracking pixel). Replace the `mt('send', 'pageview');` with something like this:

```
mt('send', 'pageview', {email: 'me@gmail.com', firstname: 'Me'});
```

As a ""beta"" feature, we've also included [fingerprintjs2](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2) which will automatically include these parameters in the page hit:

```
page_title:Test of the JS
page_language:en-US
page_referrer:
page_url:http://localhost/mauticjstest.html
fingerprint:9309a31e25389d242376f438abb310a0
resolution:1920x1080
timezone_offset:-120
platform:Linux x86_64
do_not_track:unknown
adblock:false
```

Notice the fingerprint? That's unique to your lead's device. You could set this as a custom field and set it as a unique identifier to better identify your lead. Note this may not be effective if the lead uses multiple devices. But, we're planning to leverage this to better track leads in future versions of Mautic. 

#### Shortcuts Modal

Did you know that Mautic has keyboard shortcuts? You did? Oh, then maybe you're not as excited about this as I am. Mautic has had keyboard shortcuts for a while, but they weren't very well documented. As of Mautic 1.4, you can now press `shift + ?` on any page to get an overview of the keyboard shortcuts available to you on that page.

We'll be updating our docs very soon with more details on all of these features.

There are many other features and enhancements included in this release. Check out the full list below!

This is mostly a bug fix release.  But there are a few things to note:
1. HubSpot CRM has been added as an integration in the MauticCrmBundle plugin.
2. Telize discontinued it's free service. We've added a new MaxMind GeoIP2 City Download service that will fetch MaxMind's free database to use for IP lookups. 
3. If all goes as planned, **this will be the last version to support PHP 5.3**.  In order for us to support PHP 7, we have to raise the minimum PHP version to 5.4. To be frank, it's time for PHP 5.3 to die and if your host doesn't provide PHP 5.4 or newer, well, then it's time for a new host ;-)

1759788,2015-09-03T22:09:42Z,2015-09-03T22:22:59Z,1.2.0,"## Feature Highlights

1.2.0 introduces a number of new features.

### Monitored Email

Monitored email allows Mautic to monitor an IMAP account(s) for bounced emails or unsubscribe requests.  
![](http://alan.direct/drop/2015-08-29_14-10-35-2.png)

To support this feature, you must have the PHP IMAP extension enabled (most shared hosts will already have this). Simply go to Mautic's Configuration and fill in the account details for the inbox(es) to monitor.  You can share a single inbox or configure a unique inbox per monitor.  To fetch and process the messages, run this command from cron/SSH `php app/console mautic:fetch:email`

Note that it's best to create an email specific for this purpose as Mautic will read each message it finds in the given folder.  If sending mail through Gmail, Gmail automatically rewrites the Return Path of the email as the Gmail address.  It is best to use a sending method other than Gmail although Mautic can monitor a Gmail account for bounces. 

If you select an Unsubscribe folder, Mautic will also append the email as part of the ""List-Unsubscribe"" header.  It will then parse messages it finds in that folder and automatically unsubscribe the lead.

### Webhooks

Mautic now has webhooks! Configure them through the new Webhooks link in the admin menu.  Notify 3rd party services or scripts when a new lead is created, updated, etc.

![](http://alan.direct/drop/2015-08-29_14-37-43.png)

### Smarter Lead Lists

Lead lists can now be segmented by list membership, bounce status, and others. You can now also use relative dates like today, tomorrow, next month, etc. These are currently in English but will become translated as the translators catch up.

### Lead Tagging

Lead can now be tagged through their profile page, edit form, API, or tracking pixels. Search by tags, tag through campaigns, etc. To tag via the API or tracking pixel, append `&tags=tag1,tag2,-tag3` (prefix with a minus) to delete a tag).

With this release, Mautic's URLs have changed. Up to this point, public pages (landing pages, email web previews, etc) were prefixed with /p/ while the reset of Mautic was secured.  We've reversed that now to where Mautic's secured pages are behind /s/ while the public pages do not require a prefix. For example, the login page is now http://your-mautic.com/s/login and an example landing page can be http://your-mautic.com/my-landing-page-alias. (URLs with /p/ will be redirected to be without the /p/ prefix).  

We've also added to the configuration an option to set a landing page for Mautic's root URL or redirect to the secured area (default).
