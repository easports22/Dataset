6871167,2017-06-28T18:23:05Z,2017-06-28T22:07:06Z,v2.5.0,"## Changes from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0

### Overview
The full changelog is available from GitHub at: https://github.com/mesos/chronos/compare/2.4.0...2.5.0

#### Support for Mesos 1.3.0
Chronos now uses `libmesos` 1.3.0, which should be compatible with at least Mesos 1.3.x and 1.2.x.

#### Updated many dependencies
The versions of many dependencies were bumped.

#### Added support for periods in job names
The job names can now contain letters (`[a-zA-Z]`), digits (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores
(`_`), number signs (`#`), periods (`.`), and whitespace (`[ \t\n\x0B\f\r]`). They must match the
following regular expression: `([\w\s\.#_-]+)`

#### Better support for custom executors
When using a custom executor, Chronos will now set the executor id to the job name and also include
the URIs in the CommandInfo proto.

#### Added support for specifying Docker parameters
It is now possible to specify arbitrary Docker parameters.
Check the [REST API documentation](https://mesos.github.io/chronos/docs/api.html) for more details.

#### Changed the default framework name
The framework name doesn't include the version number anymore.

#### New API endpoints
The new `/scheduler/leader` endpoint makes it possible to get the current leader.

It is now possible to mark a job as successful via the `/scheduler/job/success` API endpoint.

If a job is marked successful, the success count +of the job is incremented, the latest successful
run time is updated, and all downstream dependencies are handled as if the job had completed
executing the code in a standard run.

#### Improved constraints
Chronos now supports the `UNLIKE` operator and it is possible to constraint jobs by hostname.

#### Updates to the Dockerfile

#### Various documentation improvements

This is a brand new Chronos, and the first release in more than a year. There have been significant changes, particular with the core scheduling algorithm. Chronos is now built against the Mesos 1.0.1 API, and will work with Mesos 1.0+.

**Please note**: that this is a significant release, and may include regressions. Please report new issues to the GitHub issue tracker at https://github.com/mesos/chronos/issues.

## Internal scheduler rewrite

The internal scheduler code has been rewritten to improve reliability. This rewrite includes new unit tests, and a set of integration tests.

## A new web UI

The old Chronos web UI was known to have severe limitations. A new React & ES6 based UI has been written to address this. The new UI is not yet at feature parity with the old UI, but it supports the basic features of adding, removing, editing, starting, and stopping jobs.

## API changes

The HTTP REST API has received some updates, including some more idiomatic error responses, and the API paths have changed (they are now prefixed with `/v1`). Async jobs have been dropped (no more `async` field) as well.

## Packaging

Chronos will now only be published as a single Docker image, at http://hub.docker.com/r/mesosphere/chronos. The distribution specific packages are no longer maintained.

### Overview

#### New `LIKE` constraint

A new constraint called `LIKE` was introduced. It matches the value of an attribute of a slave against a regular expression.

#### Added support for Docker `forcePullImage`

Mesos 0.22.0 added support to forcably pulling the latest version of your Docker image before launching the task, and this behavious can be enabled in Chronos by adding the `forcePullImage` boolean to your container configuration.

#### Added support for notifying job failures through an HTTP callback

It is now possible to set a HTTP callback (using the new `--http_notification_url` flag). Which Chronos will call this endpoint in the case of job failures.

#### Improve the way in which unused offers are declined, in order to avoid starvation in a multi-framework context

We have observed that running a large number of frameworks could lead to starvation, in which some frameworks would not receive any offers from the Mesos master. This release includes changes to mitigate offer starvation.

This is done by making the amount of time for which an offer will be declined configurable. This value defaults to 5 seconds (Mesos default), but should be set to a higher value in a multi-framework environment, in order to reduce starvation.

If there is need for an offer (e.g., when a new job is added), then all already declined offers will be actively revived.

New flags:
- `--decline_offer_duration` allows configuring the duration for which unused offers are declined.
- `--revive_offers_for_new_jobs` if specified, then revive offers will be called when a job is added or changed.
- `--min_revive_offers_interval` if `--revive_offers_for_new_jobs` is specified, do not call reviveOffers more often than this interval.

#### Updates to the Dockerfile

Changed the default exported port to 8080, Chronos' default web port.

It is now possible to override the binary executed by the ENTRYPOINT script, e.g.: `docker run -it chronos /bin/bash` and similar.

#### Various documentation improvements
