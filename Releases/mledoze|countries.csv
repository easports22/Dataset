##### New format for country names.

The country names (property `name.native`) now contains every native languages. Thus the `nativeLanguage` property, which used to identify the language code used for the native country names, has been removed.

**Before**

``` json
{
    ""name"": {
        ""common"": ""Peru"",
        ""official"": ""Republic of Peru"",
        ""native"": {
            ""common"": ""Per\u00fa"",
            ""official"": ""Rep\u00fablica del Per\u00fa""
        }
    },
    ""..."": ""..."",
    ""nativeLanguage"": ""spa"",
    ""languages"": {
        ""aym"": ""Aymara"",
        ""que"": ""Quechua"",
        ""spa"": ""Spanish""
    }
}
```

**After**

``` json
{
    ""name"": {
        ""common"": ""Peru"",
        ""official"": ""Republic of Peru"",
        ""native"": {
            ""aym"": {
                ""official"": ""Piruw Suyu"",
                ""common"": ""Piruw""
            },
            ""que"": {
                ""official"": ""Piruw Ripuwlika"",
                ""common"": ""Piruw""
            },
            ""spa"": {
                ""official"": ""Rep\u00fablica del Per\u00fa"",
                ""common"": ""Per\u00fa""
            }
        }
    },
    ""..."": ""..."",
    ""languages"": {
        ""aym"": ""Aymara"",
        ""que"": ""Quechua"",
        ""spa"": ""Spanish""
    }
}
```

##### New format for translations

As proposed by @herrniemand, the format for translations has been updated to include official country names. Hereafter an example for Peru:

**Before**

``` json
{
      ""translations"": {
        ""deu"": ""Peru"",
        ""fra"": ""P\u00e9rou"",
        ""hrv"": ""Peru"",
        ""ita"": ""Per\u00f9"",
        ""jpn"": ""\u30da\u30eb\u30fc"",
        ""nld"": ""Peru"",
        ""por"": ""Per\u00fa"",
        ""rus"": ""\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0443"",
        ""spa"": ""Per\u00fa""
    }
}
```

**After**

``` json
{
    ""translations"": {
        ""deu"": {""official"": ""Republik Peru"", ""common"": ""Peru""},
        ""fra"": {""official"": ""R\u00e9publique du P\u00e9rou"", ""common"": ""P\u00e9rou""},
        ""hrv"": {""official"": ""Republika Peru"", ""common"": ""Peru""},
        ""ita"": {""official"": ""Repubblica del Per\u00f9"", ""common"": ""Per\u00f9""},
        ""jpn"": {""official"": ""\u30da\u30eb\u30fc\u5171\u548c\u56fd"", ""common"": ""\u30da\u30eb\u30fc""},
        ""nld"": {""official"": ""Republiek Peru"", ""common"": ""Peru""},
        ""por"": {""official"": ""Rep\u00fablica do Peru"", ""common"": ""Per\u00fa""},
        ""rus"": {""official"": ""\u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0443"", ""common"": ""\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0443""},
        ""spa"": {""official"": ""Rep\u00fablica de Per\u00fa"", ""common"": ""Per\u00fa""}
    }
}
```

#### Addition

add alternative name and spellings for East Timor

#### Build

A new build system has been introduced by @petert82. The single script is split up into individual files in `src/` and the symfony Console component as a dependency, to make it nice and easy to extend the conversion options in future. 

To build the `dist` files, the command is now `php countries.php convert`.

#### Updates

##### New format for country names.

The `name` property is now an object containing the common and official names of the country both in english and in the official native language of the country (the language used for this is identified by the new `nativeLanguage` property; see below).

**Before**

``` json
{
      ""name"": ""Switzerland"",
      ""nativeName"": ""Schweiz"",
      ""...""
}
```

**After**

``` json
{
    ""name"": {
        ""common"": ""Switzerland"",
        ""official"": ""Swiss Confederation"",
        ""native"": {
            ""common"": ""Schweiz"",
            ""official"": ""Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft""
        }
    },
    ""...""
}
```

##### New format for country languages.

The `language` property is now an object where keys are ISO 639-3 codes (alpha 3) and values are the name of the language in english.

The `nativeLanguage` property contains the ISO 639-3 code of the language used for the native country names.

**Before**

``` json
{   
    ""..."",
    ""language"": [""Finnish"", ""Swedish""],
    ""languageCodes"": [""fi"", ""sv""]
    ""...""
}
```

**After**

``` json
{
    ""..."",
    ""nativeLanguage"": ""fin"",
    ""languages"": {
        ""fin"": ""Finnish"",
        ""swe"": ""Swedish""
    },
    ""...""
}
```

**The keys in the `translations` property are ISO 639-3 languages codes as well.**
