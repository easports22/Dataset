Hash: SHA256

Hello Mosh users and developers,

mosh 1.3.2 has been released. This is primarily a maintenance
release. (We skipped version 1.3.1 because of a glitch in Debian
packaging. The previous release was mosh 1.3.0.)

The source code is at: https://mosh.org/mosh-1.3.2.tar.gz
(SHA-256: da600573dfa827d88ce114e0fed30210689381bbdcff543c931e4d6a2e851216)

John Hood was the primary developer and release coordinator and
deserves all our thanks.

Compatibility: mosh 1.3.2 is backwards-compatible with mosh-clients
back to 0.96 and mosh-servers back to 1.0.9.

macOS binary package: We are releasing a macOS binary package.

https://mosh.org/mosh-1.3.2.pkg is an x86_64 build for 10.10 and later.
(SHA-256: 7b00838e04e954e19d6bd5a63ff9729084bd55e21d894994916b73e996a9c42f)

However, we encourage macOS users to install via MacPorts or Homebrew,
instead of using the binary package, in order to receive automatic upgrades.

Bugs: Please let us know of any problems at the GitHub issue tracker,
at https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues. The developers can
also be found on IRC at <irc://irc.freenode.net/mosh>.

Hash: SHA256

Hello Mosh users and developers,

mosh 1.3.0 has been released. (This is a corrected release announcement
that fixes a typo in the previous email.)

The source code is at: https://mosh.org/mosh-1.3.0.tar.gz
(SHA-256: 320e12f461e55d71566597976bd9440ba6c5265fa68fbf614c6f1c8401f93376)

John Hood was the primary developer and release coordinator and
deserves all our thanks.

Change in version numbering: We have switched our version numbering to
follow the semver.org recommendations. Mosh will increment the minor
version number any time we add new functionality. (In our previous
practice, this release would probably have been called ""1.2.7"".)

Compatibility: mosh 1.3.0 is backwards-compatible with mosh-clients
back to 0.96 and mosh-servers back to 1.0.9.

macOS binary package: We are releasing a macOS binary package.

https://mosh.org/mosh-1.3.0.pkg is an amd64 build for 10.10 and later.
(SHA-256: a423fcb5aab7079e20b03cfa5e8623bb89391087dd5492d68947c89a39eee80c)

However, we encourage macOS users to install via MacPorts or Homebrew,
instead of using the binary package, in order to receive automatic upgrades.

Bugs: Please let us know of any problems at the GitHub issue tracker,
at https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues. The developers can
also be found on IRC at <irc://irc.freenode.net/mosh>.

Hello Mosh users and developers,

mosh 1.2.6 has been released.

The source code is at: https://mosh.org/mosh-1.2.6.tar.gz
(SHA-256: 7e82b7fbfcc698c70f5843bb960dadb8e7bd7ac1d4d2151c9d979372ea850e85)

John Hood was the release coordinator and deserves all of our thanks.
Major new features, all due to John, include:
- \- huge performance improvements, especially on large terminals,
- \- the ability to set a timeout to end dormant sessions automatically, and
- \- support for crypto libraries other than OpenSSL (Nettle and
  Apple Common Crypto).

On the developer side, we now have an end-to-end test suite and
continuous-integration tests on every pull request. We also worked
around a bad interaction with glibc 2.22 that caused mosh-server to
crash on startup.

Compatibility: mosh 1.2.6 is backwards-compatible with mosh-clients
back to 0.96 and mosh-servers back to 1.0.9.

macOS binary package: We are releasing a macOS binary package.

https://mosh.org/mosh-1.2.6.pkg is an i386+amd64 build for 10.9 and later.
(SHA-256: 5eb7797b0c3a5423da1c62f80f8e6268acd55b1b10a850e58fd7bb8f6bdb520d)

However, we encourage macOS users to install via MacPorts or Homebrew,
instead of using the binary package, in order to receive automatic upgrades.

Bugs: Please let us know of any problems at the GitHub issue tracker,
at https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues. The developers can
also be found on IRC at irc://irc.freenode.net/mosh.

Website moves: Please note that the Mosh repository has moved to
https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh (from https://github.com/keithw/mosh).
The Mosh website has moved to https://mosh.org (from https://mosh.mit.edu).

(If you are using a package system such as MacPorts or Homebrew, I
recommend using that, though.)

As always, Ubuntu PPA builds of the latest source are available at
ppa:keithw/mosh.

Packagers, please note that Mosh has some minor dependency changes: Perl
is now required to be >= 5.14, but IO::Socket modules are no longer
required.  If anybody needs to package for older versions of Perl, talk
to me and I'll probably bring something into the release.  Also, if
anyone needs an OS X package for 10.8 or lower, please contact me.

Your testing is very unlikely to prove Mosh to be free of bugs, but your
testing will help us make 1.2.6 a better release.  Please report any
issues you find on Github, and we can be found on IRC at
irc://irc.freenode.net/mosh.

Looking ahead, we expect Mosh 1.3 to be a feature release, bringing
significant new functionality.  SSH agent forwarding is high on the list.

The Mosh team thanks you for your help.

        10.10. (John Hood)
      \* Debian: Improve bash-completion install and
        functionality. (Suggested by Gabriel Filion, John Hood)
- Bug fixes:
      \* Automake/autoconf workarounds.  (Anders Kaseorg)
      \* mosh-server: Allow startup without PTY.  (Keith Winstein)
      \* network.cc: Properly close old fd on Socket assignment

_Compatibility_: mosh 1.2.5 is backwards-compatible with mosh clients
back to 0.96 and mosh servers back to 1.0.9.

_OS X binary packages_: We are releasing two OS X binary packages:

https://mosh.mit.edu/mosh-1.2.5.pkg is an i386+amd64 build for OS X 10.9
SHA-256: 8a590ba81edd6f706f2d0afe1cb882bd8ff8860e395b7c6ac7285306f4f12209

https://mosh.mit.edu/mosh-1.2.5-leopard.pkg is an i386+ppc build for OS X 10.5
SHA-256: 5fd77ce1c2d4b24db79be8daff3140975e53f49c83b48ff57087483133a59155

However, when possible, we encourage OS X users to install via
MacPorts or Homebrew, instead of using the binary package, in order
to receive automatic upgrades.

_Packagers, please note_ that Mosh has picked up some minor new
dependencies: for example, Debian/Ubuntu packaging now uses
bash-completion at build time, install requires a not-ancient dpkg
version, and IO::Socket::IP is recommended for IPv6 support.  All of
these dependencies are optional.

_Bugs_: Please let us know of any problems at the GitHub issue
tracker, at https://github.com/keithw/mosh/issues. The developers can
also be found on IRC at irc://irc.freenode.net/mosh.

Best regards on behalf of the Mosh team,
Keith Winstein
