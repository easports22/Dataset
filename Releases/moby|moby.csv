**IMPORTANT**: Starting with this release, Docker is on a monthly release cycle and uses a
new YY.MM versioning scheme to reflect this. Two channels are available: monthly and quarterly.
Any given monthly release will only receive security and bugfixes until the next monthly
release is available. Quarterly releases receive security and bugfixes for 4 months after
initial release. This release includes bugfixes for 1.13.1 but
there are no major feature additions and the API version stays the same.
Upgrading from Docker 1.13.1 to 17.03.0 is expected to be simple and low-risk.

**IMPORTANT**: On Linux distributions where `devicemapper` was the default storage driver,
the `overlay2`, or `overlay` is now used by default (if the kernel supports it).
To use devicemapper, you can manually configure the storage driver to use through
the `--storage-driver` daemon option, or by setting ""storage-driver"" in the `daemon.json`
configuration file.

**IMPORTANT**: In Docker 1.13, the managed plugin api changed, as compared to the experimental
version introduced in Docker 1.12. You must **uninstall** plugins which you installed with Docker 1.12
_before_ upgrading to Docker 1.13. You can uninstall plugins using the `docker plugin rm` command.

If you have already upgraded to Docker 1.13 without uninstalling
previously-installed plugins, you may see this message when the Docker daemon
starts:

```
Error starting daemon: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type types.PluginEnv
```

To manually remove all plugins and resolve this problem, take the following steps:
1. Remove plugins.json from: `/var/lib/docker/plugins/`.
2. Restart Docker. Verify that the Docker daemon starts with no errors.
3. Reinstall your plugins.

**IMPORTANT**: In Docker 1.13, the managed plugin api changed, as compared to the experimental
version introduced in Docker 1.12. You must **uninstall** plugins which you installed with Docker 1.12
_before_ upgrading to Docker 1.13. You can uninstall plugins using the `docker plugin rm` command.

If you have already upgraded to Docker 1.13 without uninstalling
previously-installed plugins, you may see this message when the Docker daemon
starts:

```
Error starting daemon: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type types.PluginEnv
```

To manually remove all plugins and resolve this problem, take the following steps:
1. Remove plugins.json from: `/var/lib/docker/plugins/`.
2. Restart Docker. Verify that the Docker daemon starts with no errors.
3. Reinstall your plugins.

**IMPORTANT**: In Docker 1.13, the managed plugin api changed, as compared to the experimental
version introduced in Docker 1.12. You must **uninstall** plugins which you installed with Docker 1.12
_before_ upgrading to Docker 1.13. You can uninstall plugins using the `docker plugin rm` command.

If you have already upgraded to Docker 1.13 without uninstalling
previously-installed plugins, you may see this message when the Docker daemon
starts:

```
Error starting daemon: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type types.PluginEnv
```

To manually remove all plugins and resolve this problem, take the following steps:
1. Remove plugins.json from: `/var/lib/docker/plugins/`.
2. Restart Docker. Verify that the Docker daemon starts with no errors.
3. Reinstall your plugins.

**IMPORTANT**: In Docker 1.13, the managed plugin api changed, as compared to the experimental
version introduced in Docker 1.12. You must **uninstall** plugins which you installed with Docker 1.12
_before_ upgrading to Docker 1.13. You can uninstall plugins using the `docker plugin rm` command.

If you have already upgraded to Docker 1.13 without uninstalling
previously-installed plugins, you may see this message when the Docker daemon
starts:

```
Error starting daemon: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type types.PluginEnv
```

To manually remove all plugins and resolve this problem, take the following steps:
1. Remove plugins.json from: `/var/lib/docker/plugins/`.
2. Restart Docker. Verify that the Docker daemon starts with no errors.
3. Reinstall your plugins.

**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.12 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm
based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When
upgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not
automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start
the docker service if;
- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the docker service will produce an error:

```
Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.
```

or

```
no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.
```

To resolve this:
- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the
  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo
systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

**NOTE**: Docker 1.12.6 will correctly validate that either an IPv6 subnet is provided or
that the IPAM driver can provide one when you specify the `--ipv6` option.

If you are currently using the `--ipv6` option _without_ specifying the
`--fixed-cidr-v6` option, the Docker daemon will refuse to start with the
following message:

``` none
Error starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: Error creating
                       default ""bridge"" network: failed to parse pool request
                       for address space ""LocalDefault"" pool "" subpool "":
                       could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv6 address
                       pool among the defaults to assign to the network
```

To resolve this error, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same
behavior as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the
value of the `--fixed-cidr-v6` flag.

In a similar way, if you specify the `--ipv6` flag when creating a network
with the default IPAM driver, without providing an IPv6 `--subnet`, network
creation will fail with the following message:

``` none
Error response from daemon: failed to parse pool request for address space
                            ""LocalDefault"" pool """" subpool """": could not find an
                            available, non-overlapping IPv6 address pool among
                            the defaults to assign to the network
```

To resolve this, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same behavior
as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the value of the
`--subnet` flag.

The network network creation will instead succeed if you use an external IPAM driver
which supports automatic allocation of IPv6 subnets.

### Runtime

**IMPORTANT**: In Docker 1.13, the managed plugin api changed, as compared to the experimental
version introduced in Docker 1.12. You must **uninstall** plugins which you installed with Docker 1.12
_before_ upgrading to Docker 1.13. You can uninstall plugins using the `docker plugin rm` command.

If you have already upgraded to Docker 1.13 without uninstalling
previously-installed plugins, you may see this message when the Docker daemon
starts:

```
Error starting daemon: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type types.PluginEnv
```

To manually remove all plugins and resolve this problem, take the following steps:
1. Remove plugins.json from: `/var/lib/docker/plugins/`.
2. Restart Docker. Verify that the Docker daemon starts with no errors.
3. Reinstall your plugins.

**IMPORTANT**: In Docker 1.13, the managed plugin api changed, as compared to the experimental
version introduced in Docker 1.12. You must **uninstall** plugins which you installed with Docker 1.12
_before_ upgrading to Docker 1.13. You can uninstall plugins using the `docker plugin rm` command.

If you have already upgraded to Docker 1.13 without uninstalling
previously-installed plugins, you may see this message when the Docker daemon
starts:

```
Error starting daemon: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type types.PluginEnv
```

To manually remove all plugins and resolve this problem, take the following steps:
1. Remove plugins.json from: `/var/lib/docker/plugins/`.
2. Restart Docker. Verify that the Docker daemon starts with no errors.
3. Reinstall your plugins.

**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.12 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm
based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When
upgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not
automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start
the docker service if;
- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the docker service will produce an error:

```
Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.
```

or

```
no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.
```

To resolve this:
- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the
  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo
systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

**NOTE**: Docker 1.12.5 will correctly validate that either an IPv6 subnet is provided or
that the IPAM driver can provide one when you specify the `--ipv6` option.

If you are currently using the `--ipv6` option _without_ specifying the
`--fixed-cidr-v6` option, the Docker daemon will refuse to start with the
following message:

``` none
Error starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: Error creating
                       default ""bridge"" network: failed to parse pool request
                       for address space ""LocalDefault"" pool "" subpool "":
                       could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv6 address
                       pool among the defaults to assign to the network
```

To resolve this error, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same
behavior as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the
value of the `--fixed-cidr-v6` flag.

In a similar way, if you specify the `--ipv6` flag when creating a network
with the default IPAM driver, without providing an IPv6 `--subnet`, network
creation will fail with the following message:

``` none
Error response from daemon: failed to parse pool request for address space
                            ""LocalDefault"" pool """" subpool """": could not find an
                            available, non-overlapping IPv6 address pool among
                            the defaults to assign to the network
```

To resolve this, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same behavior
as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the value of the
`--subnet` flag.

The network network creation will instead succeed if you use an external IPAM driver
which supports automatic allocation of IPv6 subnets.

### Runtime
- Fix race on sending stdin close event [#29424](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/29424)

### Networking
- Fix panic in docker network ls when a network was created with `--ipv6` and no ipv6 `--subnet` in older docker versions [#29416](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/29416)

### Contrib
- Fix compilation on Darwin [#29370](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/29370)

**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.12 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm
based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When
upgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not
automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start
the docker service if;
- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the docker service will produce an error:

```
Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.
```

or

```
no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.
```

To resolve this:
- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the
  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo
systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.12 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm
based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When
upgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not
automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start
the docker service if;
- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the docker service will produce an error:

```
Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.
```

or

```
no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.
```

To resolve this:
- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the
  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo
systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.12 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm
based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When
upgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not
automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start
the docker service if;
- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the docker service will produce an error:

```
Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.
```

or

```
no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.
```

To resolve this:
- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the
  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo
systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.12 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm
based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When
upgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not
automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start
the docker service if;
- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the docker service will produce an error:

```
Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.
```

or

```
no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.
```

To resolve this:
- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the
  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo
systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

information on the list of deprecated flags and APIs please have a look at
https://docs.docker.com/engine/deprecated/ where target removal dates can also
be found.

## 1.11.0 (2016-04-13)

**IMPORTANT**: With Docker 1.11, a Linux docker installation is now made of 4 binaries (`docker`, [`docker-containerd`](https://github.com/docker/containerd), [`docker-containerd-shim`](https://github.com/docker/containerd) and [`docker-runc`](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)). If you have scripts relying on docker being a single static binaries, please make sure to update them. Interaction with the daemon stay the same otherwise, the usage of the other binaries should be transparent. A Windows docker installation remains a single binary, `docker.exe`.

- Docker now cleans after itself if a save/export command fails ([#17849](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17849))
- Docker load learned how to display a progress bar ([#17329](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17329), [#120078](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/20078))

Items starting with `DEPRECATE` are important deprecation notices. For more
information on the list of deprecated flags and APIs please have a look at
https://docs.docker.com/engine/deprecated/ where target removal dates can also
be found.

## 1.11.0 (2016-04-13)

**IMPORTANT**: With Docker 1.11, a Linux docker installation is now made of 4 binaries (`docker`, [`docker-containerd`](https://github.com/docker/containerd), [`docker-containerd-shim`](https://github.com/docker/containerd) and [`docker-runc`](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)). If you have scripts relying on docker being a single static binaries, please make sure to update them. Interaction with the daemon stay the same otherwise, the usage of the other binaries should be transparent. A Windows docker installation remains a single binary, `docker.exe`.

Items starting with `DEPRECATE` are important deprecation notices. For more
information on the list of deprecated flags and APIs please have a look at
https://docs.docker.com/engine/deprecated/ where target removal dates can also
be found.

## 1.11.0 (2016-04-12)

**IMPORTANT**: With Docker 1.11, a Linux docker installation is now made of 4 binaries (`docker`, [`docker-containerd`](https://github.com/docker/containerd), [`docker-containerd-shim`](https://github.com/docker/containerd) and [`docker-runc`](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)). If you have scripts relying on docker being a single static binaries, please make sure to update them. Interaction with the daemon stay the same otherwise, the usage of the other binaries should be transparent. A Windows docker installation remains a single binary, `docker.exe`.

# Changelog

**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.10 uses a new content-addressable storage for images and layers.
A migration is performed the first time docker is run, and can take a significant amount of time depending on the number of images present.
Refer to this page on the wiki for more information: https://github.com/docker/docker/wiki/Engine-v1.10.0-content-addressability-migration
We also released a cool migration utility that enables you to perform the migration before updating to reduce downtime.
Engine 1.10 migrator can be found on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/v1.10-migrator/

### Runtime
- New `docker update` command that allows updating resource constraints on running containers [#15078](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/15078)

  This change is backward compatible in the API, but not on the CLI.
- Add `--blkio-weight-device` flag to `docker run` [#13959](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/13959)

- Show the `OSType` and `Architecture` in `docker info` [#17478](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17478)
- Add `--cgroup-parent` flag on `daemon` to set cgroup parent for all containers [#19062](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19062)
- Add `-L` flag to docker cp to follow symlinks [#16613](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/16613)
- New `status=dead` filter for `docker ps` [#17908](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17908)
- Change `docker run` exit codes to distinguish between runtime and application errors [#14012](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/14012)
- Enhance `docker events --since` and `--until` to support nanoseconds and timezones [#17495](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17495)
- Add `--all`/`-a` flag to `stats` to include both running and stopped containers [#16742](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/16742)
- Change the default cgroup-driver to `cgroupfs` [#17704](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17704)
- Emit a ""tag"" event when tagging an image with `build -t` [#17115](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17115)
- Best effort for linked containers' start order when starting the daemon [#18208](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18208)
- Add ability to add multiple tags on `build` [#15780](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/15780)
- Permit `OPTIONS` request against any url, thus fixing issue with CORS [#19569](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19569)
- Fix the `--quiet` flag on `docker build` to actually be quiet [#17428](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17428)
- Fix `docker images --filter dangling=false` to now show all non-dangling images [#19326](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19326)
- Fix race condition causing autorestart turning off on restart [#17629](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17629)
- Recognize GPFS filesystems [#19216](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19216)
- Fix obscure bug preventing to start containers [#19751](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19751)
- Forbid `exec` during container restart [#19722](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19722)
- devicemapper: Increasing `--storage-opt dm.basesize` will now increase the base device size on daemon restart [#19123](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19123)

### Security
- Add `--userns-remap` flag to `daemon` to support user namespaces (previously in experimental) [#19187](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19187)
- Add support for custom seccomp profiles in `--security-opt` [#17989](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17989)
- Add default seccomp profile [#18780](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18780)
- Add `--authorization-plugin` flag to `daemon` to customize ACLs [#15365](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/15365)
- Docker Content Trust now supports the ability to read and write user delegations [#18887](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18887)
  This is an optional, opt-in feature that requires the explicit use of the Notary command-line utility in order to be enabled.
  Enabling delegation support in a specific repository will break the ability of Docker 1.9 and 1.8 to pull from that repository, if content trust is enabled.
- Allow SELinux to run in a container when using the BTRFS storage driver [#16452](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/16452)

- Use content-addressable storage for images and layers [#17924](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17924)
  Note that a migration is performed the first time docker is run; it can take a significant amount of time depending on the number of images and containers present.
  Images no longer depend on the parent chain but contain a list of layer references.
  `docker load`/`docker save` tarballs now also contain content-addressable image configurations.
