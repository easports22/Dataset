# Change Log

* Destructors (`__destruct`) are stubbed out where it makes sense
* Allow passing a closure argument to `withArgs()` to validate multiple arguments at once. 
* `Mockery\Adapter\Phpunit\TestListener` has been rewritten because it
  incorrectly marked some tests as risky. It will no longer verify mock
  expectations but instead check that tests do that themselves. PHPUnit 6 is
  required if you want to use this fail safe.
* Removes SPL Class Loader
* Removed object recorder feature
* Bumped minimum PHP version to 5.6
* `andThrow` will now throw anything `\Throwable`
* Adds `allows` and `expects` syntax
* Adds optional global helpers for `mock`, `namedMock` and `spy`
* Adds ability to create objects using traits
* `Mockery\Matcher\MustBe` was deprecated
* Marked `Mockery\MockInterface` as internal
* Subset matcher matches recusively
* BC BREAK - Spies return `null` by default from ignored (non-mocked) methods with nullable return type
* Removed extracting getter methods of object instances
* BC BREAK - Remove implicit regex matching when trying to match string arguments, introduce `\Mockery::pattern()` when regex matching is needed
* Fix Mockery not getting closed in cases of failing test cases
* Fix Mockery not setting properties on overloaded instance mocks
* BC BREAK - Fix Mockery not trying default expectations if there is any concrete expectation
* BC BREAK - Mockery's PHPUnit integration will mark a test as risky if it
  thinks one it's exceptions has been swallowed in PHPUnit > 5.7.6.
