7663091,2017-09-07T03:37:44Z,2017-09-07T04:24:22Z,5.0.0,"Introduction of Cap'n Proto to [stabilize the recording format](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/08/stabilizing-rr-trace-format.html). Recordings created in this rr release should be replayable in any future rr release.
New [`rr pack`](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/06/new-rr-pack-command.html) command makes recordings self-contained.
Recordings can be made on one machine and replayed on a different machine by [trapping CPUID instructions](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/09/rr-trace-portability.html) when supported on the replay machine.
[Brotli compression](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/07/selecting-compression-algorithm-for-rr.html) for smaller traces and lower recording overhead.
`rr replay` command line argument `--` can be followed by any number of arguments to be passed to the debugger.
`rr` now chooses `replay` as the default subcommand if the first argument is a directory.  
Performance improvements.
