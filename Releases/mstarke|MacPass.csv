753113,2014-12-03T16:30:13Z,2014-12-03T18:16:21Z,0.5,"### Notes

Version 0.4 and 0.4.1 have introduced a bug that stores Auto-type keystroke sequences even if they are inherited.
Additionally the default sequence wasn't the usual `{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}` but the rather bad `{TAB}{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}`.
Please take the time to look at your entries and remove the Auto-type sequences. Additionally there's a helper you can use via Edit > Fix Autotype… that lets you strip all auto-type sequences.

### Upcoming
- 0.5.x will be the last version to run on 10.8.
- 0.6 is going to require 10.9 and will include KeePassHttp support.
- The editing system will be changed to work more to the Keepass standard. That is, undo is based on history entries. This kills some of the nicer features of a full undo/redo system but should make a huge step towards interoperability

### Noteworthy Changes
- Resolved issues with wrong Auto-type sequences
- Added Auto-type fix dialog that helps drill down on malformed databases
- Enabled Autotype. The feature is not fully working but simple (default) scenarios should work.
- Added password duplicates and expired entries to search filters.
- Added Quick-look preview. This creates a temporary file and thus is considered harmful. The file gets removed by MacPass but in case of a crash the files might stay there until OS X cleans the temporary folders
- MacPass now comes with document icons
- MacPass now tries to open any file regardless of file extension (this works only in the open dialog!)

### Known Issues
- KeePassHttp not enabled due to 10.9 SDK requirements
- Auto-type not fully functional
- Editing of auto-type not fully functional 
- Not all native Icons supported
- Recycle-bin can only be deleted completely (no selected Entry removal)
- No history entries will be created on changes
- .lock files are ignored
