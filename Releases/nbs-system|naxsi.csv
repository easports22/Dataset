It also brings some bug-fixes :
- Refuse to load with incoherent rules : #283
- Fixed some matchzone bugs that could lead to rules being incorrectly triggered : #282 #279
- Better^WLess worse Makefile

**NEW**
- Added support for RAW_BODY (rules to be matched against the full, raw body. Can be useful to match rules against unparsed content : XML, serialized java objects etc.)
- Confirmed support as a dynamic module (introduced in nginx 1.9.11)
- Better libinjection integration (can be used to make virtual-patching)

```
# drop any request that libinjection considers as SQLi (checked only in GET variable named ""id"")
MainRule id:4242 ""d:libinj_sql"" ""mz:$ARGS_VAR:id"" ""s:DROP"";
```
- Better blacklist matchzones (can now be as precise as whitelists)

MainRule id:4241 ""str:test"" ""mz:$URL:/foo|$ARGS_VAR:aa|$ARGS_VAR:ab"" ""s:$XSS:8"";

Libinjection is integrated as internal rules increasing $LIBINJECTION_XSS and/or $LIBINJECTION_SQL by 4 at match. libinjection will be disabled by default, and needs to be turned on using either directives LibInjectionXss / LibInjectionSql or by using dynamic modifiers $naxsi_flag_libinjection_xss / $naxsi_flag_libinjection_sql. libinjection_sql/xss can ofc be whitelisted by their IDs (libinjection_sql = 17 / libinjection_xss = 18)
