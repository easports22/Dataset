- Overwriting property with same value no longer generates write command [\#9056](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9056)
- More scalable index logging [\#9063](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9063)
- Allow skip bad entries logging during import [\#9103](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9103)

### Cypher

- Improved cypher execution speed on variable length queries where only the distinct pairs of start and end node are of interest. One query to benefit would be `MATCH (a)-[*4..5]->(b) RETURN DISTINCT a, b`. [\#9062](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9062)
- Allow more granular configuration of literals extraction [\#9093](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9093)
- It is no longer possible to CREATE or DROP composite uniqueness constraints. To enforce composite uniqueness, we refer to the new NODE KEY constraint. [\#9135](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9135)
- Use getDegree instead of expansion [\#9139](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9139)
- Correct query type for procedures [\#9143](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9143)
- Handle Ands with single value [\#9149](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9149)
- Predicates on shortest path and optional match [\#9156](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9156)

### Packaging

- Removed `neo4j-shared.sh`. Functionality is now included in all wrapper scripts directly [\#9083](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9083)

### Security

- Added new role `Editor` that is allowed to read and write data but not allowed to create new tokens. [\#9081](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9081)

### Causal Clustering

- Improve transaction streaming [\#9070](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9070)

### Tools

- Added `--version` argument to `neo4j-admin` and `neo4j` commands [\#9102](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9102)
- Renamed `neo4j-admin version` to `neo4j-admin store-info` [\#9126](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9126)

### Misc

- Show allocated memory and page hits/faults in `dbms.listQueries` [\#9037](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9037)
- Neo4j now exits with code 0 for SIGINT and SIGTERM [\#9108](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/9108)

    
    - systemd will no longer report neo4j as `failed` after you do `systemctl stop neo4j`.
    - Hitting Ctrl-C when running `neo4j console` will no longer exit with error if shutdown was performed gracefully.

Release candidates are like Milestone releases of Neo4j, which are provided under our [User Experience Improvement Program (UXIP)](http://neo4j.com/legal/neo4j-ux-improvement-program/), intended for evaluation purposes only. Use of a release candidate implies acceptance of the UXIP terms, which include allowing passive reporting about usage. Of course, we would also love to hear active feedback about your experience.

As beta software, release candidates are not appropriate for production use. There is no supported upgrade path, and while the features and APIs have been finalized, changes may still occur to correct errors (hopefully reflecting your feedback).

## Download

You can [download Neo4j 3.0-RC1](http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases) or use one of the other distribution mechanism (debian package, homebrew etc). Please check out our [Blog post](http://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-3-0-release-candidate-1/) with more details and also links to the most recent binary protocol drivers.

## Feedback, please!

Use this release candidate to help us test Neo4j thoroughly so that we can provide an amazing and stable release. We’d love to hear from you on our [public Slack](http://neo4j.com/slack) or via e-mail: feedback@neo4j.com.

Highlights of this release:
- <a href=""https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/5631"">Fixes #5631</a> - `MERGE` with multiple labels respects uniqueness constraints<
- <a href=""https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/5799"">Fixes #5799</a> - to  match variable length patterns of length one
- Fixes <code>neo4j-import</code> handling of nodes with many labels, which might have been observed as an `InvalidRecordException`
- `neo4j-import` treats extra data columns without a corresponding header as ""bad"". New option `--ignore-extra-columns` to log those into the ""bad"" file
- When stopping Neo4j, the timeout will no longer forcefully shut down the process (which would require recovery on next start). Instead, a warning is displayed and waiting will continue.
- Within a cluster, slaves which fail to apply updates will kernel panic to prevent further updates attempts, which could cause other harm. Failure to apply a transaction may be caused by severe underlying problems, for example out of disk space.

Notably, this release:
- A huge facelift to the Neo4j Browser, including many new ways to view and work with your data, including a new graph legend, the ability to terminate cypher queries, curving arrows, panning, visual query plans and much more.
- A new cost based query planner for Cypher &mdash; which is much smarter at planning queries and more transparent about what it’s doing. This compiler is available in addition to the existing rule based compiler and Neo4j will automatically select which to use for each query (this behavior can be adjusted using compiler directives as described in the <a href=""http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.0/query-tuning.html"">documentation of cypher query tuning</a>).
- Full support for <a href=""http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.0/how-do-i-profile-a-query.html"">profiling and explaining Cypher query plans</a>, including a query plan visualizer in the Neo4j Browser.
- Username and password authentication for accessing Neo4j. <i>All access to the Neo4j Browser or REST APIs will now need to supply valid credentials.</i> For more detail, see the section on <a href=""http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.0/security-server.html#security-server-auth"">server authentication and authorization in the documentation</a>.
- A new page cache, which is faster, provides significant improvements in handling of concurrent operations, and is easier to configure than the memory mapping in previous Neo4j releases &mdash; now requiring only a single configuration setting (see <a href=""http://neo4j.com/docs/2.2.0/configuration-io-examples.html"">the configuration documentation</a> for details).
- Introduces fast-write buffering which dramatically increases the throughput of many write workloads without any configuration required.
- The use of separate transactions logs for the graph and the indexes, co-ordinated by an XA system, has been replaced by a singular transactional management and one unified transaction log. This substantially reduces resource overhead and improves scalability. Note that as result of this, the previously exposed XA and JTA functionalities have been removed.
- Many, many fixes improving stability, performance and usability.

In addition, _Neo4j 1.9 Enterprise_ introduces auto-clustering support, with dramatically simplified configuration and deployment for high demand production use.
- Support for [auto-clustering in _Neo4j Enterprise_](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/ha.html), which replaces the previous Zookeeper based HA clustering, provides a streamlined deployment process and is much safer and more resilient in failure scenarios.
- New [neo4j-arbiter](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/arbiter-instances.html) tool, which acts as a voting instance in a Neo4j cluster but does not keep a data store or handle transactions.
- Addition of [string manipulation, timestamp and other functions](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/query-function.html) to the Cypher query language.
- Improvements to memory utilization, which reduces working memory requirements and improves overall performance.
- New [REST endpoints for inspecting cluster status information](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/ha-rest-info.html) (master, slave, etc).
- Correction of several concurrency and performance issues.
- Improvements to [Online Backup](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/operations-backup.html) in _Neo4j Enterprise_, including auto-detection of full vs incremental backup based on existing content at the backup location.
- Updates to Neo4j server webadmin, including welcome pages for new users.

**It is recommended to upgrade all previous Neo4j installations to this release.** Neo4j 1.9 does not require any explicit upgrade to persistent stores created using Neo4j 1.7 and 1.8 installations, however _current users of Neo4j Enterprise must consult the documentation and update the cluster configuration_. Please see the [deployment](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/deployment.html) and [cluster upgrade](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/upgrade-guide.html) sections of the Neo4j manual for more detail. Also note that Neo4j 1.9 is tested and supported with [Oracle JRE 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). _Users of previous Java versions should upgrade to [Oracle JRE 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) when deploying Neo4j 1.9._
