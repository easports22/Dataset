4096455,2016-09-10T09:28:38Z,2016-09-10T13:20:21Z,Glances 2.7 release notes,"Welcome to the new Glances 2.7 version.

![GLANCES](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/raw/v2.7/docs/_static/screencast.gif)

# New features

## Add a new Application Monitoring Process (AMP) #780

The AMP plugin replaces the old Monitoring Process plugin. It allows users to
define a processes list and optionally execute a specific action.

![AMP](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/raw/v2.7/docs/_static/amps.png)

An entry in the AMP list should be defined by a regular expression (on the command
line). When the regular expression matchs (processes are ""up and running""),
Glances do the following thinks:
- if nothing is defined, the global CPU and memory of matched processes are
  displayed
- a command line could be executed and the output will be displayed
- a Python script existing in the glances/amps folder could be executed. For
  this last option a list of predefined scripts is provided by the Glances team:
  Nginx, Systemd and SystemV. You can write your owns Python scripts by following
  a existing script as a example.

If you want to monitor the Dropbox daemon, you should add the following section
in the Glances configuration file:

```
[amp_dropbox]
enable=true
regex=.*dropbox.*
refresh=3
command=dropbox status
one_line=false
countmin=1
```

How to read this configuration file ?
- First of all, we add a new AMP section. An AMP entry should alway start with
  amp_ ([amp_dropbox]).
- We enable the AMP entry (enable=true).
- We want to focus on the dropbox process (regex=._dropbox._).
- The AMP entry will be refreshed every 3 seconds (refresh=3).
- The command line to execute if the process is up and running (command=dropbox status).
- We force Glances to display all the output of the command line, not only the
  first line (one_line=false).
- If the number of matching process is < 1, the line will be display with the
  Warning color (countmin=1).

See more examples in the default Glances configuration file (https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/blob/master/conf/glances.conf)

# New Ports scanner plugin #734

The Ports Scanner plugin aims at monitoring local or remote TCP/ICMP ports status.

![PORTS](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/raw/v2.7/docs/_static/ports.png)

A list of host/port is define in the configuration file and the result (RTT delay)
is displayed in the user interface.

```
[ports]
# Ports scanner plugin configuration
# Interval in second between two scans
refresh=30
# Set the default timeout (in second) for a scan (can be overwrite in the scan list)
timeout=3
# If port_default_gateway is True, add the default gateway on top of the scan list
port_default_gateway=True
# Define the scan list (port_x_- with 1 < x < 255)
# port_x_host (name or IP) is mandatory
# port_x_port (TCP port number) is optional (if not set, use ICMP)
# port_x_description is optional (if not set, define to host:port)
# port_x_timeout is optional and overwrite the default timeout value
# port_x_rtt_warning is optional and defines the warning threshold in ms
port_1_host=192.168.0.1
port_1_port=80
port_1_description=Home Box
port_1_timeout=1
port_2_host=www.free.fr
port_2_description=My ISP
port_3_host=www.google.com
port_3_description=Internet ICMP
port_3_rtt_warning=1000
port_4_host=www.google.com
port_4_description=Internet Web
port_4_port=80
port_4_rtt_warning=1000
```

## CPU additional stats monitoring: Context switch, Interrupts... #810

The following CPU stats are grabbed and displayed in the user interface:
- ctx_switches: number of context switches (voluntary + involuntary) per second
- interrupts: number of interrupts per second
- soft_interrupts: number of software interrupts per second. Always set to 0 on Windows and SunOS.
- syscalls: number of system calls since boot. Always set to 0 on Linux.

![CPU](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/raw/v2.7/docs/_static/cpu-wide.png)

These new statistics are also available through the API:

```
$ python -m glances -w
Glances web server started on http://0.0.0.0:61208/

$ curl http://127.0.0.1:61208/api/2/cpu
{
   ""guest_nice"" : 0,
   ""irq"" : 0,
   ""time_since_update"" : 49.5867121219635,
   ""total"" : 7.1,
   ""softirq"" : 0,
   ""ctx_switches"" : 157897,
   ""interrupts"" : 51886,
   ""user"" : 5.7,
   ""iowait"" : 0.1,
   ""guest"" : 0,
   ""soft_interrupts"" : 10239,
   ""syscalls"" : 0,
   ""cpucore"" : 4,
   ""system"" : 1.4,
   ""idle"" : 92.9,
   ""nice"" : 0,
   ""steal"" : 0
}
```

## Add Cassandra/Scylla export plugin #857

Additionally to CSV files, InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, StatsD, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch,
and Riemann, it is now possible to export stats to a Cassandra or Scylla server.

The connection should be defined in the Glances configuration file as following:

```
[cassandra]
host=localhost
port=9042
protocol_version=3
keyspace=glances
replication_factor=2
table=localhost
```

and run Glances with:

```
$ glances --export-cassandra
```

The data model is the following:

```
CREATE TABLE <table> (plugin text, time timeuuid, stat map<text,float>, PRIMARY KEY (plugin, time))
```

Only numerical stats are stored in the Cassandra table. All the stats are
converted to float. If a stat can not be converted to float, it is not stored
in the database.

## IRQ monitoring #911

Only on GNU/Linux, a new IRQ plugin displays the top 5 interrupts rate.

![IRQ](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/raw/v2.7/docs/_static/irq.png)

The stats are grabbed from the /proc/interrupts file.

## Display a warning message when Glances is outdated #865

On online machines, Glances can check if a newer version is available on Pypi.

This feature can be enable (true) or disable (false) in the Glances configuration
file:

```
[global]
# Does Glances should check if a newer version is available on Pypi ?
check_update=true
```

## Filter processes by others stats (username) #748

The processes filtering feature has been improved.

It's possible to filter the processes list using the ENTER key.

Filter syntax is the following (examples):

```
python > Filter processes name or command line starting with python (regexp)
.*python.- > Filter processes name or command line containing python (regexp)
username:nicolargo > Processes of nicolargo user (key:regexp)
cmdline:/usr/bin.- > Processes starting by /usr/bin
```
