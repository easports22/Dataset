This will remove the large amount of new dependencies. Apologies to all who have already modified their code to use the new API.
* Npgsql 3.2 introduced Windows performance counter support. While this allows you to know more about connection usage, initialization of performance counters caused slowdowns and exceptions. They are no longer initialized by default - specify `Use Perf Counters=true` if you want to use them ([#1435](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1435)).

- Fixed multi-statement commands issues ([#641](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/641)). You can now send commands with statements that depend on each other, such as ""CREATE TABLE X ...; INSERT INTO X...""
- The connection pool has been rewritten from scratch and many previous performance issues should be gone (#726).
- NpgsqlConnection's OpenAsync() is now truly async, (#379) and Open() is now fully sync (#709).
- Native binary support for PostGIS 2D types, thanks @rossini-t (#665]).
- Composite type support (#441), see [the PostgreSQL docs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rowtypes.html) and the [the Npgsql docs](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/types/enums_and_composites.html).
- Exception behavior has been improved and made more compatible with other ADO.NET providers. It's now easier to catch exceptions Npgsql throws (#897).
- When mapping enum or composite types, you can now control how field names are mapped to PostgreSQL names (#859).
- Continued efforts from 3.0 to reduce heap allocations - Npgsql 3.1 should place even less pressure on the garbage collector.

This release fixes numerous bugs, including one that could cause pooled connections to ""leak"" under certain load conditions (#1019). Thanks to [@shortspider](https://github.com/shortspider) for raising and fixing the issue.

An additional issue related to Npgsql's internal query parser was fixed (#946). Note that as a result, parameter names can no longer start with a digit - this could cause breakage if you were using parameter names such as `:1`.

Also, when closing a pooled connection that had an active transaction, that transaction would not be rolled back immediately. This could cause issues and has been fixed - transactions are rolled back immediately upon close. See issue #927.

Note that NpgsqlConnection's `DataSource` property now returns a URL (e.g. tcp://localhost:5432). Code that relied on the contents of `DataSource` is probably now broken. See issue #903.

Npgsql 2.2 had a Windows installer that would set up Npgsql in the GAC and update your `machine.config` file - this installer has been revived and will now be released with 3.x version (check our [releases tab on Github](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/releases).

Npgsql 3.0.0 is a near-total rewrite, and represents over a year's effort.
- Switch to 100% binary communication with PostgreSQL #447. This has the following advantages:
  - Significant speed increase for some types
  - Improves general stability and removed dependency user-defined parameters such as
    `DateStyle`, `extra_float_digits`, `lc_monetary` etc. (see #514, #324, #163, etc.)
  - More consistent behavior between simple and prepared statements
  - Simplified codebase (we previously supported both text and binary codecs for most types)
- True async support for NpgsqlReader for better scalability. This implements the new .NET 4.5 [ADO.NET async methods](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh211418%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396), _except_ for the async connection methods (these are a major goal for 3.1, see #379.
- Reworked type handing that greatly reduces memory churn. Except your application to allocate and release much less memory than before.
- New high-performance import/export API that exposes PostgreSQL COPY. See [the docs](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/copy.html) for more details.
- Much better support for PostgreSQL asynchronous operations, such as LISTEN/NOTIFY. See [the docs](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/continuous-processing.html) for more details.

There are many other changes, [see here](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A3.0) to get an idea.

Note that Npgsql 3.0 _is not a simple drop-in replacement for 2.2_: there are some breaking changes involved.
Please consult the [migration guide](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/migration/3.0.html) and test extensively before deploying to production.

Major goals for Npgsql 3.1 includes:
- Complete async support for connections (#379)
- Fully implement the Entity Framework 7 provider (already in progress, #249)
- Support .NET Core (#471)
- Full, native PostGIS support (#529)

UPDATE (2014-09-06): Kenji Uno made an installer available which helps users to setup Npgsql to work with VS.Net Database Designer as well as EntityFramework. You can find more information about this installer [here](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/issues/128#issuecomment-54145803). You can find the installer in the downloads section.

This release contains 249 commits since the last stable release. Includes bug fixes, improvements and new features. 

**Update notice: If you have been using Npgsql 2.2.0-rc2, you don't need to update to this version. They are the same except for the Assembly version information.**

## Major highlights

### Visual Studio DDEX support

Kenji Uno added support for DDEX. Now you can use Npgsql with Visual Studio data designer. This is a missing feature a lot of our users requested in the past. Kenji added a tutorial about how to use Npgsql with DDEX. You can find it here: https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/wiki/Visual-Studio-Design-Time-Support---DDEX-Provider#install-npgsqlddexprovidervsix

### Entity Framework

David Karlaš added support for EFMigration and Database creation in EF6+. 
Now it is possible to start Code First projects without needing to create a database upfront. EntityFramework and Npgsql will take care of it.
Emil Lenngren added support for a lot of missing features of EntityFramework. 

A list containing fixes from David and Emil as well as others for EntityFramework can be seen here: https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/issues?direction=desc&labels=entity+framework&milestone=2&page=1&sort=created&state=closed

### SSLStream support

In this release, SSLStream is on by default. 
If you want to use Mono.Security, you will need to use the following line in your code:

```
NpgsqlConnection.UseSslStream = false;
```

Note that in future releases, this option may not be available anymore as we are removing the dependency on Mono.Security assembly. Let us know in the [forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/npgsql-help) if you have any problem with ssl when using SSLStream. This will help us check if we will be able to remove Mono.Security assembly.

### Added support for JSON, JSONB and HSTORE datatypes

Shay added support for those datatypes. 

### Added GSSAPI support on Windows

Brian Crowell added support for GSSAPI on windows.  Now it is easier to use Active Directory when authenticating users.

### Removed support for protocol v2

Postgresql versions which use only protocol 2 are very old and don't receive support from postgresql group anymore. By removing support for protocol version 2, we removed a lot of code and can focus on functionalities provided by protocol 3.

### Removed support for Postgresql 8.4 and below

In [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/npgsql-dev/omQ40Eq0HoA), we talked about making Npgsql support the officially supported postgresql versions. we talked about making Npgsql support the officially supported postgresql versions. Postgresql has [a table of officially supported versions](http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) and we decided to follow this table to guide us which postgresql version we will have support to.

This doesn't necessarily mean that Npgsql won't work on unsupported versions. It may work if we don't add any SQL or unsupported feature. For example, today Npgsql 2.2 works only on Postgresql 8.2 and above because we added server side support for command timeout handling and some other queries which aren't supported on earlier versions.

If you are using earlier postgresql versions, please, use an older version of Npgsql. We are creating a compatibility table to show which Postgresql version Npgsql works with.

### Thanks

I'd like to give a special thanks to Kenji Uno for his excellent work with Npgsql DDEX support. DDEX support was one of the biggest missing features of Npgsql.

I'd like to thank  Emil Lenngren for all his work with Entity Framework improvements and insightful comments, David Karlaš for his help with Entity Framework support. Shay Rojansky, Glen Parker and Josh Cooley for all contributions and comments, and a big thanks to all the other contributors who helped us to make this release.

## Major highlights

### Visual Studio DDEX support

Kenji Uno added support for DDEX. Now you can use Npgsql with Visual Studio data designer. This is a missing feature a lot of our users requested in the past. Kenji added a tutorial about how to use Npgsql with DDEX. You can find it here: https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/wiki/Visual-Studio-Design-Time-Support---DDEX-Provider#install-npgsqlddexprovidervsix

### Entity Framework

#### David Karlaš added support for EFMigration and Database creation in EF6+

Now it is possible to start Code First projects without needing to create a database upfront. EntityFramework and Npgsql will take care of it.
Emil Lenngren added support for a lot of missing features of EntityFramework. 

A list containing fixes from David and Emil as well as others for EntityFramework can be seen here: https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/issues?direction=desc&labels=entity+framework&milestone=2&page=1&sort=created&state=closed

### SSLStream support

In this release, SSLStream is on by default. 
If you want to use Mono.Security, you will need to use the following line in your code:

```
NpgsqlConnection.UseSslStream = false;
```

Note that in future releases, this option may not be available anymore as we are removing the dependency on Mono.Security assembly. Let us know in the [forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/npgsql-help) if you have any problem with ssl when using SSLStream. This will help us check if we will be able to remove Mono.Security assembly.

### Added support for JSON, JSONB and HSTORE datatypes

Shay added support for those datatypes. 

### Added GSSAPI support on Windows

Brian Crowell added support for GSSAPI on windows.  Now it is easier to use Active Directory when authenticating users.

### Removed support for protocol v2

Postgresql versions which use only protocol 2 are very old and don't receive support from postgresql group anymore. By removing support for protocol version 2, we removed a lot of code and can focus on functionalities provided by protocol 3.

### Removed support for Postgresql 8.3 and below

In [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/npgsql-dev/omQ40Eq0HoA), we talked about making Npgsql support the officially supported postgresql versions. we talked about making Npgsql support the officially supported postgresql versions. Postgresql has [a table of officially supported versions](http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) and we decided to follow this table to guide us which postgresql version we will have support to.

This doesn't necessarily mean that Npgsql won't work on unsupported versions. It may work if we don't add any SQL or unsupported feature. For example, today Npgsql 2.2 works only on Postgresql 8.2 and above because we added server side support for command timeout handling and some other queries which aren't supported on earlier versions.

If you are using earlier postgresql versions, please, use an older version of Npgsql. We are creating a compatibility table to show which Postgresql version Npgsql works with.

## Fixed bugs:

[#91] Support for EFMigration and Database creation
[#152] NpgsqlInterval different constructors different ToString
[#177] XML data type doesn't seem to be quoting parameters properly on insert 
[#188] Buffer too small problem in NpgsqlCopySerializer
[#201] Dynamic type parameters: Cannot cast System.Int32 into any valid DbType after upgrading from 2.0.14.3 to 2.1.2.0
[#208] ObjectDisposeException
[#219] [#1011005] using 2 NpgsqlCopyIn at the same time
[#223] HasRows property's bug
[#231] NpgsqlParameterCollection.Clear() doesn't reset NpgsqlParameter.Collection
[#225] Handle IEnumerable<int> parameter
[#246] Take followed by Skip is generated incorrectly in Entity Framework
[#262] FirstOrDefault() on navigation property subquery throws “Not Implemented” Exception
[#269] Fix 's' value mapped to the 'a' byte
[#280] Bad SQL produced when selecting a field that was also used in the orderBy of a let subquery
[#287] Fix operator handling and date functions for EF

### Thanks

I'd like to give a special thanks to Kenji Uno for his excellent work with Npgsql DDEX support. DDEX support was one of the biggest missing features of Npgsql.

I'd like to thank  Emil Lenngren for all his work with Entity Framework improvements and insightful comments, David Karlaš for his help with Entity Framework support. Shay Rojansky, Glen Parker and Josh Cooley for all contributions and comments, and a big thanks to all the other contributors who helped us to make this release.

This is a the final release of Npgsql 2.1.0

### Thanks

Before talking about the changes in this release, I'd like to thank some people who did an incredible job and that without them this release wouldn't be possible!

Glen Parker has been working in the optimizations tasks since his first git commit. From the changelog you  can see his tireless work regarding each part of Npgsql which could be optimized. Thank you very much for your contributions, Glen!

Shay Rojansky has been helping as the mastermind of the project restructuring support. He contributed a lot of changes which made our lives working with Npgsql much better. Thanks to him we can compile Npgsql for different .net platform versions easily. He also got TeamCity build server working as well as github integration. He helped us to get EntityFramework pre-6 and pos-6 verions easily integrated.
Thank you, Shay!

And Dave Page who helped us with the server where the TeamCity is installed. Without his help, I'm sure our TeamCity installation would be much more difficult. Thank you, Dave!

## Major highlights

### Version numbers

Starting with this release, we are going to number our versions based on the semver schema. (http://semver.org). We may not follow strictly everything though. This is a work in progress.

This version was supposed to be a continuation of the 2.0.13 series as we already have a 2.0.13 beta1 released. But we made so many changes since the 2.0.13 that we decided to jump the version number to 2.1. 

### Entity Framework

We added initial support for Entity Framework 6.0. We isolated the entity framework code in two other assemblies: Npgsql.LegacyEntityFramework.dll and Npgsql.EntityFramework.dll. The first one is for entity framework pre-6 version and the other one is for entity framework 6.0 and above. This was needed in order to facilitate the deployment and the code organization as the apis and namespaces change a lot depending on the entity framework version. 

Support for 6.0 isn't yet complete and is to be considered optional at the moment. We will add better support in upcoming versions. We already have Support for EFMigration and Database creation (https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/pull/91) and identity insert support  (https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql/pull/160) which will be made available in future releases of Npgsql

### Entity Framework configuration

App.config and Web.config configuration has been changed. It depends on the EF version you are using. More info about that can be found at: 
http://fxjr.blogspot.com.br/2014/02/using-entity-framework-6-with-npgsql-210.html

### SSLStream support

In this release, we added support to use SSLStream. But it isn't used by default. To keep backward compatibility, we still use by default Mono.Security for SSL connections. But this may change in the future. We ask that you test your application with SSLStream and check if you get any problems.
in order to use SSLStream, you have to ask Npgsql to use it by using the following line:

```
NpgsqlConnection.UseSslStream = true
```

This will make Npgsql use SSLStream for new ssl connections.
Please, give it a try and let us know if it works ok for you.

### Project restructuring

Npgsql had its project layout restructured to easy management of different platforms Npgsql targets: .net 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, entity framework prior 6.0, entity framework after 6.0. Huge structure changes to our testsuite. Before, our tests depended on an external script to setup database tables, now everything is done inside the tests setup. Thanks Shay Rojansky.

## New features:

Add support for new error fields added in PostgreSQL 9.3. See here for more information about those fields: http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=991f3e5ab3f8196d18d5b313c81a5f744f3baaea Thanks David Rowley for patch.

Initial support for Entity Framework 6. See http://fxjr.blogspot.com/2013/06/initial-ef-6-support-added-to-npgsql.html for more information about it.

[#30] Improved connection timeout handling. Thanks Glen Parker.        

[#41], [#52], [#77], [#72], [#80] Huge internal query handling which added a big performance boost for prepared statements and unprepared statements as well. Binary parameter codec infrastructure has been added, and several data types (currently bytea, text, boolean, integers, and gloats) can now use PG's binary coded support, including arrays of those types, which offers a dramatic performance boost for parameter and result values in prepared statements. Previously we didn't recommend using prepared statements with Npgsql, only for bytea data types. Thanks to Glen Parker, this is now a thing of the past. 

[#74] Use new ""Discard all"" syntax when releasing connection from pool. Thanks Chen Huajun.

New connection string parameter ""AlwaysPrepare"" to indicate to Npgsql to always prepare statements before executing.

[#110] Added support for Entity Framework before version 6.0 and after 6.0. They are totally different things regarding APIs and namespaces. Thanks Shay Rojansky and Kenji Uno.

Added nuget EFProvider installation. Thanks Shay Rojansky.

Added EF6 ConnectionFactory class. Thanks Shay Rojansky.

[#135] Fix for operators @@, @> and <@. Thanks Glen Parker and jjchiw.

[#110] Added support for Entity Framework before version 6.0 and after 6.0. They are totally different things regarding APIs and namespaces. Thanks Shay Rojansky and Kenji Uno.

Added nuget EFProvider installation. Thanks Shay Rojansky.

Added EF6 ConnectionFactory class. Thanks Shay Rojansky.

[#135] Fix for operators @@, @> and <@. Thanks Glen Parker and jjchiw.

[#117] Command timeout improvements. Thanks Glen Parker.

## Final considerations:

This release wouldn't be possible without the help of two members: Glen Parker and Shay Rojansky.

Glen Parker has been working in the optimizations tasks since his first git commit. He is an optimization machine! From the changelog you can see his tireless work regarding each part of Npgsql which could be optimized. Thank you very much for your contributions, Glen!

Shay Rojansky has been helping as the mastermind of the project restructuring support. He contributed a lot of changes which made our lives working with Npgsql much better. Thanks to him we can compile Npgsql for different .net platform versions easily. He also got TeamCity build server working as well as github integration. He helped us to get EntityFramework pre-6 and pos-6 verions easily integrated. Thank you, Shay!

I also would like to thank Dave Page who helped us with the server where the TeamCity is installed. Without his help, I'm sure our TeamCity installation would be much more difficult. Thank you, Dave!

Thanks to Glen Parker, it is fixed on github https://github.com/glenebob/Npgsql2/commit/5800eec287fc72ee4d051750b05253aed8deb46e.  If you are having hang problems while using Npgsql after upgrading the server to 9.3 version, this version is for you.
