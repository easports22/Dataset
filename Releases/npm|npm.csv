The changes largely came together in one piece, so I'm just gonna leave the commit line here:

* [`f6ebf5e8b`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f6ebf5e8bd6a212c7661e248c62c423f2b54d978) [`f97ad6a38`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f97ad6a38412581d059108ea29be470acb4fa510) [`f644018e6`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f644018e6ef1ff7523c6ec60ae55a24e87a9d9ae) [`8af91528c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/8af91528ce6277cd3a8c7ca8c8102671baf10d2f) [`346a34260`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/346a34260b5fba7de62717135f3e083cc4820853) Two factor authentication, profile editing and token management.  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

### TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

You can now enable two-factor authentication for your npm account.  You can even do it from the CLI.  In fact, you have to, for the time being:

```
npm profile enable-tfa
```

With the default two-factor authentication mode you'll be prompted to enter a one-time password when logging in, when publishing and when modifying access rights to your modules.

### TOKEN MANAGEMENT

You can now create, list and delete authentication tokens from the comfort of the command line.  Authentication tokens created this way can have NEW restrictions placed on them.  For instance, you can create a `read-only` token to give to your CI.  It will be able to download your private modules but it won't be able to publish or modify modules.  You can also create tokens that can only be used from certain network addresses.  This way you can lock down access to your corporate VPN or other trusted machines.

Deleting tokens isn't new, you could [do it via the website](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens) but now you can do it via the CLI as well.

### CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD, SET YOUR EMAIL

You can finally change your password from the CLI with `npm profile set password`!  You can also update your email address with `npm profile set email <address>`.  If you change your email address we'll send you a new verification email so you verify that its yours.

### AND EVERYTHING ELSE ON YOUR PROFILE

You can also update all of the other attributes of your profile that previously you could only update via the website: `fullname`, `homepage`, `freenode`, `twitter` and `github`.

### AVAILABLE STAND ALONE

All of these features were implemented in a stand alone library, so if you have use for them in your own project you can find them in [npm-profile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-profile) on the registry.  There's also a little mini-cli written just for it at [npm-profile-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-profile-cli).  You might also be interested in the [API documentation](https://github.com/npm/registry/tree/master/docs) for these new features: [user profile editing](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/user/profile.md) and [authentication](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/user/authentication.md).

This release has been incubating rather longer than usual and it's grown quite a bit in that time. I'm also excited to say that it has contributions from **27** different folks, which is a new record for us. Our previous record was 5.1.0 at 21. Before that the record had been held by 1.3.16 since _December of 2013_.

If you can't get enough of the bleeding edge, I encourage you to check out our canary release of npm. Get it with `npm install -g npmc`. It's going to be seeing some exciting stuff in the next couple of weeks, starting with a rewriten `npm dedupe`, but moving on to… well, you'll just have to wait and find out.

### PERFORMANCE

* [`d080379f6`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d080379f620c716afa2c1d2e2ffc0a1ac3459194) `pacote@6.0.1` Updates extract to use tar@4, which is much faster than the older tar@2. It reduces install times by as much as 10%. ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))
* [`4cd6a1774`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/4cd6a1774f774506323cae5685c9ca9a10deab63) [`0195c0a8c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/0195c0a8cdf816834c2f737372194ddc576c451d) [#16804](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/16804) `tar@4.0.1` Update publish to use tar@4. tar@4 brings many advantages over tar@2: It's faster, better tested and easier to work with. It also produces exactly the same byte-for-byte output when producing tarballs from the same set of files. This will have some nice carry on effects for things like caching builds from git. And finally, last but certainly not least, upgrading to it also let's us finally eliminate `fstream`—if you know what that is you'll know why we're so relieved.

This caused problems because folks were using peer deps to indicate that the target of the peer dep needed to be able to require the dependency and had been relying on the fact that peer deps didn't change the shape of the tree (as of npm@3). The fix that will actually work for people is for a peer dep to insist on never being installed deeper than the the thing it relies on.  At the moment this is tricky because the thing the peer dep relies on may not yet have been added to the tree, so we don't know where it is. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

### npx!!!

npx is a tool intended to help round out the experience of using packages from the npm registry — the same way npm makes it super easy to install and manage dependencies hosted on the registry, npx is meant to make it easy to use CLI tools and other executables hosted on the registry. It greatly simplifies a number of things that, until now, required a bit of ceremony to do with plain npm.

6945352,2017-07-06T01:55:38Z,2017-07-06T02:04:31Z,,"Hey y'all~

We've got some goodies for you here, including `npm@5`'s first semver-minor release! This version includes a huge number of fixes, particularly for some of the critical bugs users were running into after upgrading npm. You should overall see a much more stable experience, and we're going to continue hacking on fixes for the time being. Semver-major releases, specially for tools like npm, are bound to cause some instability, and getting `npm@5` stable is the CLI team's top priority for now!

Not that bugfixes are the only things that landed, either: between improvements that fell out of the bugfixes, and some really cool work by community members like [@mikesherov](https://github.com/mikesherov), `npm@5.1.0` is **_twice as fast_** as `npm@5.0.0` in some benchmarks. We're not stopping there, either: you can expect a steady stream of speed improvements over the course of the year. It's not _top_ priority, but we'll keep doing what we can to make sure npm saves its users as much time as possible.

Hang on to your seats. At **100 commits**, this release is a bit of a doozy. 😎

### FEATURES

Semver-minor releases, of course, mean that there's a new feature somewhere, right? Here's what's bumping that number for us this time:

* [`a09c1a69d`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/a09c1a69df05b753464cc1272cdccc6af0f4da5a) [#16687](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/16687) Allow customizing the shell used to execute `run-script`s. ([@mmkal](https://github.com/mmkal))

This includes references to the specific version each package is intended to see, and can be used for many things, such as [converting `package-lock.json` to other lockfile formats](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/880578566907248640), various optimizations, and verifying correctness of a package tree. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
* [`47e8fc8eb`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/47e8fc8eb9b5faccef9e03ab991cf37458c16249) [#17508](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/17508) Make `npm ls` take package locks (and shrinkwraps) into account. This means `npm ls` can now be used to see [which dependencies are missing](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/880446509547794437), so long as a package lock has been previously generated with it in. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
* [`f0075e7ca`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f0075e7caa3e151424a254d7809ae4489ed8df90) [#17508](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/17508) Take `package.json` changes into account when running installs -- if you remove or add a dependency to `package.json` manually, npm will now pick that up and update your tree and package lock accordingly. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
* [`83a5455aa`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/83a5455aac3c5cc2511ab504923b652b13bd66a0) [#17205](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/17205) Add `npm udpate` as an alias for `npm update`, for symmetry with `install`/`isntall`. ([@gdassori](https://github.com/gdassori))

* [`82df7bb16`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/82df7bb16fc29c47a024db4a8c393e55f883744b) [#17351](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/17351) As some of you may already know `npm build` doesn't do what a lot of people expect: It's mainly an npm plumbing command, and is part of the more familiar `npm rebuild` command. That said, a lot of users assume that this is the way to run an npm `run-script` named `build`, which is an incredibly common script name to use. To clarify things for users, and encourage them to use `npm run build` instead, npm will now warn if `npm build` is run without any arguments. ([@lennym](https://github.com/lennym))

### PERFORMANCE

### BUGFIXES

* [#17508](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/17508) This is a big PR that fixes a variety of issues when installing from package locks. If you were previously having issues with missing dependencies or unwanted removals, this might have fixed it ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna)):
  * It introduces a new `package-lock.json` field, called `requires`, which tracks which modules a given module requires.
  * It fixes [#16839](https://github.com/npm/npm/issue/16839) which was caused by not having this information available, particularly when git dependencies were involved.
  * It fixes [#16866](https://github.com/npm/npm/issue/16866), allowing the `package.json` to trump the `package-lock.json`.
  * `npm ls` now loads the shrinkwrap, which opens the door to showing a full tree of dependencies even when nothing is yet installed. (It doesn't do that yet though.)

Here's another patch release, soon after the other!

This particular release includes a slew of fixes to npm's git support, which was causing some issues for a chunk of people, specially those who were using self-hosted/Enterprise repos.  All of those should be back in working condition now.

There's another shiny thing you might wanna know about: npm has a Canary release now!  The `npm5` experiment we did during our beta proved to be incredibly successful: users were able to have a tight feedback loop between reports and getting the bugfixes they needed, and the CLI team was able to roll out experimental patches and have the community try them out right away.  So we want to keep doing that.

From now on, you'll be able to install the 'npm canary' with `npm i -g npmc`.  This release will be a separate binary (`npmc`.  Because canary.  Get it?), which will update independently of the main CLI.  Most of the time, this will track `release-next` or something close to it.  We might occasionally toss experimental branches in there to see if our more adventurous users run into anything interesting with it.  For example, the current canary (`npmc@5.0.1-canary.6`) includes an [experimental multiproc branch](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/16633) that parallelizes tarball extraction across multiple processes.

If you find any issues while running the canary version, please report them and let us know it came from `npmc`!  It would be tremendously helpful, and finding things early is a huge reason to have it there.  Happy hacking!

### A NOTE ABOUT THE ISSUE TRACKER

Just a heads up: We're preparing to do a massive cleanup of the issue tracker.  It's been a long time since it was something we could really keep up with, and we didn't have a process for dealing with it that could actually be sustainable.

We're still sussing the details out, and we'll talk about it more when we're about to do it, but the plan is essentially to close old, abandoned issues and start over.  We will also [add some automation](https://github.com/probot) around issue management so that things that we can't keep up with don't just stay around forever.

Stay tuned!

### GIT YOLO

* [`1f26e9567`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1f26e9567a6d14088704e121ebe787c38b6849a4) `pacote@2.7.27`: Fixes installing committishes that look like semver, even though they're not using the required `#semver:` syntax.  ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))
* [`85ea1e0b9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/85ea1e0b9478551265d03d545e7dc750b9edf547) `npm-package-arg@5.1.1`: This includes the npa git-parsing patch to make it so non-hosted SCP-style identifiers are correctly handled.  Previously, npa would mangle them (even though hosted-git-info is doing the right thing for them).  ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))

### COOL NEW OUTPUT

The new summary output has been really well received!  One downside that reared its head as more people used it, though, is that it doesn't really tell you anything about the toplevel versions it installed.  So, if you did `npm i -g foo`, it would just say ""added 1 package"".  This patch by [@rmg](https://github.com/rmg) keeps things concise while still telling you what you got!  So now, you'll see something like this:

```
$ npm i -g foo bar
+ foo@1.2.3
+ bar@3.2.1
added 234 packages in .005ms
```

As you all know, fresh software that's gone through major overhauls tends to miss a lot of spots the old one used to handle well enough, and `npm@5` is no exception. The CLI team will be doing faster release cycles that go directly to the `latest` tag for a couple of weeks while 5 stabilizes a bit and we're confident the common low-hanging fruit people are running into are all taken care of.

With that said: this is our first patch release! The biggest focus is fixing up a number of git-related issues that folks ran into right out the door. It also fixes other things, like some proxy/auth-related issues, and even has a neat speed boost! (You can expect more speed bumps in the coming releases as pending work starts landing, too!)

Thanks everyone who's been reporting issues and submitting patches!

6510541,2017-05-26T03:24:16Z,2017-05-26T03:30:44Z,,"Wowowowowow npm@5!

This release marks months of hard work for the young, scrappy, and hungry CLI team, and includes some changes we've been hoping to do for literally years. npm@5 takes npm a pretty big step forward, significantly improving its performance in almost all common situations, fixing a bunch of old errors due to the architecture, and just generally making it more robust and fault-tolerant. It comes with changes to make life easier for people doing monorepos, for users who want consistency/security guarantees, and brings semver support to git dependencies. See below for all the deets!

### Breaking Changes

* Existing npm caches will no longer be used: you will have to redownload any cached packages. There is no tool or intention to reuse old caches. ([#15666](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15666))

* `npm install ./packages/subdir` will now create a symlink instead of a regular installation. `file://path/to/tarball.tgz` will not change -- only directories are symlinked. ([#15900](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15900))

* npm will now scold you if you capitalize its name. seriously it will fight you.

* [npm will `--save` by default now](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/859229741676625920). Additionally, `package-lock.json` will be automatically created unless an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` exists. ([#15666](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15666))

* Git dependencies support semver through `user/repo#semver:^1.2.3` ([#15308](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15308)) ([#15666](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15666)) ([@sankethkatta](https://github.com/sankethkatta))

* Git dependencies with `prepare` scripts will have their `devDependencies` installed, and `npm install` run in their directory before being packed.

* `npm cache` commands have been rewritten and don't really work anything like they did before. ([#15666](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15666))

* `--cache-min` and `--cache-max` have been deprecated. ([#15666](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15666))

* Running npm while offline will no longer insist on retrying network requests. npm will now immediately fall back to cache if possible, or fail. ([#15666](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15666))

* package locks no longer exclude `optionalDependencies` that failed to build. This means package-lock.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json should now be cross-platform. ([#15900](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15900))

* If you generated your package lock against registry A, and you switch to registry B, npm will now try to [install the packages from registry B, instead of A](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/862834964932435969). If you want to use different registries for different packages, use scope-specific registries (`npm config set @myscope:registry=https://myownregist.ry/packages/`). Different registries for different unscoped packages are not supported anymore.

* Shrinkwrap and package-lock no longer warn and exit without saving the lockfile.

* Local tarballs can now only be installed if they have a file extensions `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, or `.tgz`.

* A new loglevel, `notice`, has been added and set as default.

* One binary to rule them all: `./cli.js` has been removed in favor of `./bin/npm-cli.js`. In case you were doing something with `./cli.js` itself. ([#12096](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12096)) ([@watilde](https://github.com/watilde))

* Stub file removed ([#16204](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/16204)) ([@watilde](https://github.com/watilde))

* The ""extremely legacy"" `_token` couchToken has been removed. ([#12986](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12986))

### Feature Summary

#### Installer changes

* A new, standardised lockfile feature meant for cross-package-manager compatibility (`package-lock.json`), and a new format and semantics for shrinkwrap. ([#16441](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/16441))

* `--save` is no longer necessary. All installs will be saved by default. You can prevent saving with `--no-save`. Installing optional and dev deps is unchanged: use `-D/--save-dev` and `-O/--save-optional` if you want them saved into those fields instead. Note that since npm@3, npm will automatically update npm-shrinkwrap.json when you save: this will also be true for `package-lock.json`. ([#15666](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15666))

* Installing a package directory now ends up creating a symlink and does the Right Thing™ as far as saving to and installing from the package lock goes. If you have a monorepo, this might make things much easier to work with, and probably a lot faster too. 😁 ([#15900](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15900))

* Project-level (toplevel) `preinstall` scripts now run before anything else, and can modify `node_modules` before the CLI reads it.

* Two new scripts have been added, `prepack` and `postpack`, which will run on both `npm pack` and `npm publish`, but NOT on `npm install` (without arguments). Combined with the fact that `prepublishOnly` is run before the tarball is generated, this should round out the general story as far as putzing around with your code before publication.

* Git dependencies with `prepare` scripts will now [have their devDependencies installed, and their prepare script executed](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/860363896443371520) as if under `npm pack`.

* Git dependencies now support semver-based matching: `npm install git://github.com/npm/npm#semver:^5` (#15308, #15666)

* `node-gyp` now supports `node-gyp.cmd` on Windows ([#14568](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14568))

* npm no longer blasts your screen with the whole installed tree. Instead, you'll see a summary report of the install that is much kinder on your shell real-estate. Specially for large projects. ([#15914](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15914)):
```
$ npm install
npm added 125, removed 32, updated 148 and moved 5 packages in 5.032s.
$
```

* `--parseable` and `--json` now work more consistently across various commands, particularly `install` and `ls`.

* Indentation is now [detected and preserved](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/860690502932340737) for `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `npm-shrinkwrap.json`. If the package lock is missing, it will default to `package.json`'s current indentation.

#### Publishing

* New [publishes will now include *both* `sha512`](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/863201943082065920) and `sha1` checksums. Versions of npm from 5 onwards will use the strongest algorithm available to verify downloads. [npm/npm-registry-client#157](https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-client/pull/157)

#### Cache Rewrite!

We've been talking about rewriting the cache for a loooong time. So here it is. Lots of exciting stuff ahead. The rewrite will also enable some exciting future features, but we'll talk about those when they're actually in the works. [#15666](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15666) is the main PR for all these changes. Additional PRs/commits are linked inline.

* Package metadata, package download, and caching infrastructure replaced.

* It's a bit faster. [Hopefully it will be noticeable](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/865393382260056064). 🤔

* With the shrinkwrap and package-lock changes, tarballs will be looked up in the cache by content address (and verified with it).

* Corrupted cache entries will [automatically be removed and re-fetched](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/854933138182557696) on integrity check failure.

* npm CLI now supports tarball hashes with any hash function supported by Node.js. That is, it will [use `sha512` for tarballs from registries that send a `sha512` checksum as the tarball hash](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/858137093624573953). Publishing with `sha512` is added by [npm/npm-registry-client#157](https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-client/pull/157) and may be backfilled by the registry for older entries.

* Remote tarball requests are now cached. This means that even if you're missing the `integrity` field in your shrinkwrap or package-lock, npm will be able to install from the cache.

* Downloads for large packages are streamed in and out of disk. npm is now able to install packages of """"""any"""""" size without running out of memory. Support for publishing them is pending (due to registry limitations).

* [Automatic fallback-to-offline mode](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/854176565587984384). npm will seamlessly use your cache if you are offline, or if you lose access to a particular registry (for example, if you can no longer access a private npm repo, or if your git host is unavailable).

* A new `--prefer-offline` option will make npm skip any conditional requests (304 checks) for stale cache data, and *only* hit the network if something is missing from the cache.

* A new `--prefer-online` option that will force npm to revalidate cached data (with 304 checks), ignoring any staleness checks, and refreshing the cache with revalidated, fresh data.

* A new `--offline` option will force npm to use the cache or exit. It will error with an `ENOTCACHED` code if anything it tries to install isn't already in the cache.

* A new `npm cache verify` command that will garbage collect your cache, reducing disk usage for things you don't need (-handwave-), and will do full integrity verification on both the index and the content. This is also hooked into `npm doctor` as part of its larger suite of checking tools.

* The new cache is *very* fault tolerant and supports concurrent access.
  * Multiple npm processes will not corrupt a shared cache.
  * Corrupted data will not be installed. Data is checked on both insertion and extraction, and treated as if it were missing if found to be corrupted. I will literally bake you a cookie if you manage to corrupt the cache in such a way that you end up with the wrong data in your installation (installer bugs notwithstanding).
  * `npm cache clear` is no longer useful for anything except clearing up disk space.

* Package metadata is cached separately per registry and package type: you can't have package name conflicts between locally-installed packages, private repo packages, and public repo packages. Identical tarball data will still be shared/deduplicated as long as their hashes match.

* HTTP cache-related headers and features are ""fully"" (lol) supported for both metadata and tarball requests -- if you have your own registry, you can define your own cache settings the CLI will obey!

* `prepublishOnly` now runs *before* the tarball to publish is created, after `prepare` has run.

### FEATURES

* [`d13c9b2f2`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d13c9b2f24b6380427f359b6e430b149ac8aaa79) `init-package-json@1.10.0`: The `name:` prompt is now `package name:` to make this less ambiguous for new users.

  The default package name is now a valid package name. For example: If your package directory has mixed case, the default package name will be all lower case.
* [`f08c66323`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f08c663231099f7036eb82b92770806a3a79cdf1) [#16213](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/16213) Add `--allow-same-version` option to `npm version` so that you can use `npm version` to run your version lifecycles and tag your git repo without actually changing the version number in your `package.json`.

* [`f5e8becd0`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f5e8becd05e0426379eb0c999abdbc8e87a7f6f2) Timing has been added throughout the install implementation. You can see it by running a command with `--loglevel=timing`. You can also run commands with `--timing` which will write an `npm-debug.log` even on success and add an entry to `_timing.json` in your cache with the timing information from that run.

Welcome a wrinkle on npm's registry API!

Codename: Corgi

![corgi-meme](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/757502/24126107/64c14268-0d89-11e7-871b-d457e6d0082b.jpg)

This release has some bug fixes, but it's mostly about bringing support for MUCH smaller package metadata. How much smaller? Well, for npm itself it reduces 416K of gzip compressed JSON to 24K.

As a user, all you have to do is update to get to use the new API. If you're interested in the details we've [documented the changes](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/responses/package-metadata.md) in detail.

#### CORGUMENTS

Package metadata: now smaller. This means a smaller cache and less to download.

* [`86dad0d74`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/86dad0d747f288eab467d49c9635644d3d44d6f0) Add support for filtered package metadata. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### NO SHRINKWRAP, NO PROBLEM

Previously we needed to extract every package's tarball to look for an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` before we could begin working through what its dependencies were. This was one of the things stopping npm's network accesses from happening more concurrently.  The new filtered package metadata provides a new key, `_hasShrinkwrap`. When that's set to `false` then we know we don't have to look for one.

* [`4f5060eb3`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/4f5060eb31b9091013e1d6a34050973613a294a3) [#15969](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15969) Add support for skipping `npm-shrinkwrap.json` extraction when the registry can affirm that one doesn't exist. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### INTERRUPTING SCRIPTS

* [`878aceb25`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/878aceb25e6d6052dac15da74639ce274c8e62c5) [#16129](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/16129) Better handle Ctrl-C while running scripts. `npm` will now no longer exit until the script it is running has exited.

😩😤😅 Okay! We have another `next` release for ya today. So, yes! With v4.4.3 we fixed the bug that made bundled scoped modules uninstallable. But somehow I overlooked the fact that we: A) were using these and B) that made upgrading to v4.4.3 impossible. 😭

So I've renamed those two scoped modules to no longer use scopes and we now have a shiny new test to ensure that scoped modules don't creep into our transitive deps and make it impossible to upgrade to `npm`.

(None of our woes applies to most of you all because most of you all don't use bundled dependencies. `npm` does because we want the published artifact to be installable without having to already have `npm`.)

This is a small patch release, mostly because the published tarball for v4.4.2 was missing a couple of modules, due to a bug involving scoped modules, bundled dependencies and legacy tree layouts.

There are a couple of other things here that happened to be ready to go. So without further ado…

That means there's a few fixes here and there. Nothing too big codewise, though.

The most exciting part of this release is probably our [shiny new Contributing](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/latest/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/latest/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) docs! [@snopeks](https://github.com/snopeks) did some ✨fantastic✨ work hashing it out, and we're really hoping this is a nice big step towards making contributing to npm easier. The troubleshooting doc will also hopefully solve common issues for people! Do you think something is missing from it? File a PR and we'll add it! The current document is just a baseline for further editing and additions.

Also there's maybe a bit of an easter egg in this release. 'Cause those are fun and I'm a huge nerd. 😉

Aaaah, [@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) here, it's been a little while since I did one of these! This is a nice little release, we've got an update notifier, vastly less verbose error messages, new warnings on package metadata that will probably give you a bad day, and a sprinkling of bug fixes.

#### UPDATE NOTIFICATIONS

We now have a little nudge to update your `npm`, courtesy of [update-notifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/update-notifier).
- [`148ee66`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/148ee663740aa05877c64f16cdf18eba33fbc371) [#15774](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15774) `npm` will now check at start up to see if a newer version is available. It will check once a day. If you want to disable this, set `optOut` to `true` in `~/.config/configstore/update-notifier-npm.json`. ([@ceejbot](https://github.com/ceejbot))

#### LESS VERBOSE ERROR MESSAGES

`npm` has, for a long time, had very verbose error messages. There was a lot of info in there, including the cause of the error you were seeing but without a lot of experience reading them pulling that out was time consuming and difficult.

With this change the output is cut down substantially, centering the error message. So, for example if you try to `npm run sdlkfj` then the entire error you'll get will be:

```
npm ERR! missing script: sldkfj

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
npm ERR!     /Users/rebecca/.npm/_logs/2017-02-24T00_41_36_988Z-debug.log
```

The CLI team has discussed cutting this down even further and stripping the `npm ERR!` prefix off those lines too. We'd appreciate your feedback on this!

This has the potential to be interesting because it means that in the future private registry products ([npme](https://npme.npmjs.com/docs/)!) will be able to report on these metrics.

As far as news go, you may have noticed that the CLI team dropped support for`node@0.12` when that version went out of maintenance. Still, we've avoided explicitly breaking it and `node@0.10` so far -- but not much longer.

Sometime soon, the CLI team plans on switching over to language features onlyavailable as of `node@4 LTS`, and will likely start dropping old versions of node as they go out of maintenance. The new features are exciting! We're really looking forward to using them in the core CLI (and its dependencies) as we keep upwith our current feature work.

And speaking of features, this release is a minor bump due to a small change inhow `npm login` works for the sake of supporting OAuth-based login for npmEnterprise users. But we won't leave the rest of y'all out -- we're working on a larger version of this feature. Soon enough, you'll be able to log in to npmwith, say, GitHub -- and use some shiny features that come from the integration. Or turn on 2FA and other such security features. Keep your eyes peeled for newon this in the next few releases and our weekly newsletter!

#### NEW AUTH TYPES

There's a new command line option: `--auth-type`, which can be used to log in toa supporting registry with OAuth2 or SAML. The current implementation is mainly meant to support npmE customers, so if you're one of those: ask us about using it! If not, just hold off cause we'll have a much more complete version of this feature out soon.

#### FASTER STARTUP. SOMETIMES!

`request` is pretty heavy. And it loads a bunch of things. It's actually a pretty big chunk of npm's load time. This small patch by Rebecca will make it so npm only loads that module when we're actually intending to make network requests. Those of you who use npm commands that run offline might see a small speedup in startup time.

#### IMPROVED CLI SEARCH~

You might recall if you've been keeping up that one of the reasons for a semver-major bump to `npm@4` was an improved CLI search (read: no longer blowing up Node). The work done for that new search system, while still relying on a full metadata download and local search, was also meant to act as groundwork for then-ongoing work on a brand-new, smarter search system for npm. Shortly after `npm@4` came out, the bulk of the server-side work was done, and with this release, the npm CLI has integrated use of the new endpoint for high-quality, fast-turnaround searches.

No, seriously, it's _fast_. And _relevant_:

[![GOTTA GO FAST! This is a gif of the new npm search returning results in around a second for `npm search web framework`.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17535/21954136/f007e8be-d9fd-11e6-9231-f899c12790e0.gif)](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15481)

Give it a shot! And remember to check out the new website version of the search, too, which uses the same backend as the CLI now. 🎉

Incidentally, the backend is a public service, so you can write your own search tools, be they web-based, CLI, or GUI-based. You can read up on the [full documentation for the search endpoint](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md#get-v1search), and let us know about the cool things you come up with!

Includes a fallback to ""classic"" search. ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))

#### WHERE DID THE DEBUG LOGS GO

This is another pretty significant change: Usually, when the npm process crashed, you would get an `npm-debug.log` in your current working directory. This debug log would get cleared out as soon as you ran npm again. This was a bit annoying because 1) you would get a random file in your `git status` that you might accidentally commit, and 2) if you hit a hard-to-reproduce bug and instinctually tried again, you would no longer have access to the repro `npm-debug.log`.

So now, any time a crash happens, we'll save your debug logs to your cache folder, under `_logs` (`~/.npm` on *nix, by default -- use `npm config get cache` to see what your current value is). The cache will now hold a (configurable) number of `npm-debug.log` files, which you can access in the future. Hopefully this will help clean stuff up and reduce frustration from missed repros! In the future, this will also be used by `npm report` to make it super easy to put up issues about crashes you run into with npm. 💃🕺🏿👯‍♂️

We have a twee little release this week as we come back from the holidays.

#### 0.12 IS UNSUPPORTED NOW (really)

After [jumping the gun a little](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v4.0.2), we can now officially remove 0.12 from our supported versions list. The Node.js project has now officially ended even maintenance support for 0.12 and thus, so will we. To reiterate from the last time we did this:

What this means:
- Your contributions will no longer block on the tests passing on 0.12.
- We will no longer block dependency upgrades on working with 0.12.
- Bugs filed on the npm CLI that are due to incompatibilities with 0.12 (and older versions) will be closed with a strong urging to upgrade to a supported version of Node.
- On the flip side, we'll continue to (happily!) accept patches that address regressions seen when running the CLI with Node.js 0.12.

What this doesn't mean:
- The CLI is going to start depending on ES2015+ features. npm continues to work, in almost all cases, all the way back to Node.js 0.8, and our long history of backwards compatibility is a source of pride for the team.
- We aren't concerned about the problems of users who, for whatever reason, can't update to newer versions of npm. As mentioned above, we're happy to take community patches intended to address regressions.

We're not super interested in taking sides on what version of Node.js you ""should"" be running. We're a workflow tool, and we understand that you all have a diverse set of operational environments you need to be able to support. At the same time, we _are_ a small team, and we need to put some limits on what we support. Tracking what's supported by our runtime's own team seems most practical, so that's what we're doing.

#### WRITING TO SYMLINKED `package.json` (AND OTHER FILES)

If your `package.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json` or `.npmrc` were a symlink and you used an `npm` command that modified one of these (eg `npm config set` or `npm install --save`) then previously we would have removed your symlink and replaced it with an ordinary file. While making these files symlinks is pretty uncommon, this was still surprising behavior. With this fix we now overwrite the _destination_ of the symlink and preserve the symlink itself.
- [`a583983`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/a5839833d3de7072be06884b91902c093aff1aed) [write-file-atomic#5](https://github.com/npm/write-file-atomic/issues/5) [#10223](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10223) `write-file-atomic@1.3.1`: When the target is a symlink, write-file-atomic now overwrites the _destination_ of the symlink, instead of replacing the symlink itself. This makes it's behavior match `fs.writeFile`.
  
  Fixed a bug where it would ALWAYS fs.stat to look up default mode and chown values even if you'd passed them in. (It still used the values you passed in, but did a needless stat.) ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

This fixes a bug in the metrics reporting where, if you had enabled it then installs would create a metrics reporting process, that would create a metrics reporting process, that would… well, you get the idea. Killing them was tricky because they constantly had new PIDs. There were a few tricks but the easiest was to just reboot.

I'm really excited about `npm@4.1.0`. I know, I know, I'm kinda overexcited in my changelogs, but this one is GREAT. We've got a WHOLE NEW subcommand, I mean, when was the last time you saw that? YEARS! And we have the beginnings of usage metrics reporting. Then there's a fix for a really subtle bug that resulted in `shasum` errors. And then we also have a few more bug fixes and other improvements.

#### ANONYMOUS METRIC REPORTING

We're adding the ability for you all to help us track the quality of your experiences using `npm`. Metrics will be sent if you run:

```
npm config set send-metrics true
```

Then `npm` will report to `registry.npmjs.org` the number of successful and failed installations you've had. The data contains no identifying information and npm will not attempt to correlate things like IP address with the metrics being submitted.

It's a rare day that we add a new command to `npm`, so I'm excited to present to you `npm doctor`. It checks for a number of common problems and provides some recommended solutions. It was put together through the hard work of [@watilde](https://github.com/watilde).

#### FIX MAJOR SOURCE OF SHASUM ERRORS

If you've been getting intermittent shasum errors then you'll be pleased to know that we've tracked down at least one source of them, if not THE source of them.
- [`87afc8b`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/87afc8b466f553fb49746c932c259173de48d0a4) [#14626](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/14626) [npm/npm-registry-client#148](https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-client/pull/148) `npm-registry-client@7.4.5`: Fix a bug where an `ECONNRESET` while fetching a package file would result in a partial download that would be reported as a ""shasum mismatch"". It now throws away the partial download and retries it. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### FILE URLS AND NODE.JS 7

When `npm` was formatting `file` URLs we took advantage of `url.format` to construct them. Node.js 7 changed the behavior in such a way that our use of `url.format` stopped producing URLs that we could make use of.

The reasons for this have to do with the `file` URL specification and how invalid (according to the specification) URLs are handled. How this changed is most easily explained with a table:

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>URL</th><th>Node.js &lt;= 6</th><th><tt>npm</tt>'s understanding</th><th>Node.js 7</th><th><tt>npm</tt>'s understanding</th></tr>
<tr><td>VALID</td><td><tt>file:///abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>file:///abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>/abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>file:///abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>/abc/def</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>invalid</td><td><tt>file:/abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>file:/abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>/abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>file:///abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>/abc/def</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>invalid</td><td><tt>file:abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>file:abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>$CWD/abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>file://abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>/def</tt> on the <tt>abc</tt> host</td></tr>
<tr><td>invalid</td><td><tt>file:../abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>file:../abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>$CWD/../abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>file://../abc/def</tt></td><td><tt>/abc/def</tt> on the <tt>..</tt> host</td></tr>
</table>

So the result was that passing a `file` URL that npm had received that used through Node.js 7's `url.format` changed its meaning as far as `npm` was concerned. As those kinds of URLs are, per the specification, invalid, how they should be handled is undefined and so the change in Node.js wasn't a bug per se.

Our solution is to stop using `url.format` when constructing this kind of URL.

The ""Xmas Chasm"", as we like to call it, has already begun. So for those of you reading it from the other side: Hi! Welcome back!

This week's release is a relatively small one, involving just a few bugfixes and dependency upgrades. The CLI team has been busy recently with scoping out `npm@5`, and starting to do initial spec work for in-scope stuff.

- [`9776d8f`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/9776d8f70a0ea8d921cbbcab7a54e52c15fc455f) [#15081](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15081) `bundledDependencies` are intended to be left untouched by the installer, as much as possible -- if they're bundled, we assume that you want to be particular about the contents of your bundle. The installer used to have a corner case where existing dependencies that had bundledDependencies would get clobbered by as the installer moved stuff around, even though the installer already avoided moving deps that were themselves bundled.

This should address [#14427](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/14427) and related issues, but it's turned out to be a tremendously difficult issue to reproduce in a test.

([@watilde](https://github.com/watilde))

#### UPDATE SUPPORT MATRIX

With the advent of the second official Node.js LTS release, Node 6.x 'Boron', the Node.js project has now officially dropped versions 0.10 and 0.12 out of the maintenance phase of LTS.

4566644,2016-11-04T02:33:01Z,2016-11-04T02:44:53Z,,"Hola, amigxs. I know it's been a long time since I rapped at ya, but I been spending a lotta time quietly reflecting on all the things going on in my life. I was, like, [in Japan for a while](https://gist.github.com/othiym23/c98bd4ef5d9fb3f496835bd481ef40ae), and before that my swell colleagues [@zkat](https://github.com/zkat) and [@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) have been very capably managing the release process for quite a while. But I returned from Japan somewhat refreshed, very jetlagged, and filled with a burning urge to get `npm@4` as stable as possible before we push it out to the user community at large, so I decided to do this release myself. (Also, huge thanks to Kat and Rebecca for putting out `npm@4` so capably while I was on vacation! So cool to return to a major release having gone so well without my involvement!)

That said...

#### NEVER TRUST AN X.0.0 RELEASE

Even though 4.0.1 came out hard on the heels of 4.0.0 with a couple critical fixes, we've found a couple other major issues that we want to see fixed before making `npm@4` into `npm@latest`. Some of these are arguably breaking changes on their own, so now is the time to get them out if we're going to do so before `npm@5`, and all of them are pretty significant blockers for a substantial number of users, so now is the best time to fix them.

##### PREPUBLISHONLY WHOOPS

The code running the `publish*` lifecycle events was very confusingly written. In fact, we didn't really figure out what it was doing until we added the new `prepublishOnly` event and it was running people's scripts from the wrong directory. We made it simpler. See the [commit message](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/8b32d67aa277fd7e62edbed886387a855f58387f) for details.

Because the change is no longer running publish events when publishing prebuilt artifacts, it's technically a breaking / semver-major change. In the off chance that the new behavior breaks any of y'all's workflows, let us know, and we can roll some or all of this change back until `npm@5` (or forever, if that works better for you).

##### G'BYE NODE.JS 0.10, 0.12, and 5.X; HI THERE, NODE 7

With the advent of the second official Node.js LTS release, Node 6.x 'Boron', the Node.js project has now officially dropped versions 0.10 and 0.12 out of the maintenance phase of LTS. (Also, Node 5 was never part of LTS, and will see no further support now that Node 7 has been
released.) As a small team with limited resources, the npm CLI team is following suit and dropping those versions of Node from its CI test matrix.

What this means:
- Your contributions will no longer block on the tests passing on 0.10 and 0.12.
- We will no longer block dependency upgrades on working with 0.10 and 0.12.
- Bugs filed on the npm CLI that are due to incompatibilities with 0.10 or 0.12 (and older versions) will be closed with a strong urging to upgrade to a supported version of Node.
- On the flip side, we'll continue to (happily!) accept patches that address regressions seen when running the CLI with Node.js 0.10 and 0.12.

What this doesn't mean:
- The CLI is going to start depending on ES2015+ features. npm continues to work, in almost all cases, all the way back to Node.js 0.8, and our long history of backwards compatibility is a source of pride for the team.
- We aren't concerned about the problems of users who, for whatever reason, can't update to newer versions of npm. As mentioned above, we're happy to take community patches intended to address regressions.

We're not super interested in taking sides on what version of Node.js you ""should"" be running. We're a workflow tool, and we understand that you all have a diverse set of operational environments you need to be able to support. At the same time, we _are_ a small team, and we need to put some limits on what we support. Tracking what's supported by our runtime's own team seems most practical, so that's what we're doing.

##### DISENTANGLING SCOPE

The new `Npm-Scope` header was previously reusing the `scope` configuration option to pass the current scope back to your current registry (which, as [described previously](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/release-next/CHANGELOG.md#send-extra-headers-to-registry), is meant to set up some upcoming registry features). It turns out that had some [seriously weird consequences](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/14412) in the case where you were already configuring `scope` in your own environment. The CLI now uses separate configuration for this.

So thanks to folks who were running on `npm@next`, we managed to find a few issues of notes in that preview version, and we're rolling out a small patch change to fix them. Most notably, anyone who was using a symlinked `node` binary (for example, if they installed Node.js through `homebrew`), was getting a very loud warning every time they ran scripts. Y'all should get warnings in a more useful way, now that we're resolving those path symlinks.

Another fairly big change that we decided to slap into this version, since `npm@4.0.0` is never going to be `latest`, is to make it so `devDependencies` are included in `npm-shrinkwrap.json` by default -- if you do not want this, use `--production` with `npm shrinkwrap`.

4447023,2016-10-21T01:46:47Z,2016-10-21T01:57:46Z,,"Welcome to `npm@4`, friends!

This is our first semver major release since the release of `npm@3` just over a year ago. Back then, `@3` turned out to be a bit of a ground-shaking release, with a brand-new installer with significant structural changes to how npm set up your tree. This is the end of an era, in a way. `npm@4` also marks the release when we move _both_ `npm@2` and `npm@3` into maintenance: We will no longer be updating those release branches with anything except critical bugfixes and security patches.

While its predecessor had some pretty serious impact, `npm@4` is expected to have a much smaller effect on your day-to-day use of npm. Over the past year, we've collected a handful of breaking changes that we wanted to get in which are only breaking under a strict semver interpretation (which we follow). Some of these are simple usability improvements, while others fix crashes and serious issues that required a major release to include.

We hope this release sees you well, and you can look forward to an accelerated release pace now that the CLI team is done focusing on sustaining work -- our Windows fixing and big bugs pushes -- and we can start focusing again on usability, features, and performance. Keep an eye out for `npm@5` in Q1 2017, too: We're planning a major overhaul of `shrinkwrap` as well as various speed and usability fixes for that release. It's gonna be a fun ride. I promise. 😘

#### BRIEF OVERVIEW OF **BREAKING** CHANGES

The following breaking changes are included in this release:
- `npm search` rewritten to stream results, and no longer supports sorting.
- `npm scripts` no longer prepend the path of the node executable used to run npm before running scripts. A `--scripts-prepend-node-path` option has been added to configure this behavior.
- `npat` has been removed.
- `prepublish` has been deprecated, replaced by `prepare`. A `prepublishOnly` script has been temporarily added, which will _only_ run on `npm publish`.
- `npm outdated` exits with exit code `1` if it finds any outdated packages.
- `npm tag` has been removed after a deprecation cycle. Use `npm dist-tag`.
- Partial shrinkwraps are no longer supported. `npm-shrinkwrap.json` is considered a complete installation manifest except for `devDependencies`.
- npm's default git branch is no longer `master`. We'll be using `latest` from now on.

#### SEARCH REWRITE (**BREAKING**)

Let's face it -- `npm search` simply doesn't work anymore. Apart from the fact that it grew slower over the years, it's reached a point where we can no longer fit the entire registry metadata in memory, and anyone who tries to use the command now sees a really awful memory overflow crash from node.

It's still going to be some time before the CLI, registry, and web team are able to overhaul `npm search` altogether, but until then, we've rewritten the previous `npm search` implementation to _stream_ results on the fly, from both the search endpoint and a local cache. In absolute terms, you won't see a performance increase and this patch _does_ come at the cost of sorting capabilities, but what it does do is start outputting results as it finds them. This should make the experience much better, overall, and we believe this is an acceptable band-aid until we have that search endpoint in place.

Incidentally, if you want a really nice search experience, we recommend checking out [npms.io](http://npms.io), which includes a handy-dandy [`npms-cli`](https://npm.im/npms-cli) for command-line usage -- it's an npm search site that returns high-quality results quickly and is operated by members of the npm community.

#### SCRIPT NODE PATH (**BREAKING**)

Thanks to some great with by [@addaleax](https://github.com/addaleax), we've addressed a fairly tricky issue involving the node process used by `npm scripts`.

Previously, npm would prefix the path of the node executable to the script's `PATH`. This had the benefit of making sure that the node process would be the same for both npm and `scripts` unless you had something like [`node-bin`](https://npm.im/node-bin) in your `node_modules`. And it turns out lots of people relied on this behavior being this way!

It turns out that this had some unintended consequences: it broke systems like [`nyc`](https://npm.im/nyc), but also completely broke/defeated things like [`rvm`](https://rvm.io/) and [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) by often causing things that relied on them to fall back to the global system versions of ruby and python.

In the face of two perfectly valid, and used alternatives, we decided that the second case was much more surprising for users, and that we should err on the side of doing what those users expect. Anna put some hard work in and managed to put together a patch that changes npm's behavior such that we no longer prepend the node executable's path _by default_, and adds a new option, `--scripts-prepend-node-path`, to allow users who rely on this behavior to have it add the node path for them.

This patch also makes it so this feature is discoverable by people who might run into the first case above, by warning if the node executable is either missing or shadowed by another one in `PATH`. This warning can also be disabled with the `--scripts-prepend-node-path` option as needed.

([@addaleax](https://github.com/addaleax))

#### REMOVE `npat` (**BREAKING**)

Let's be real here -- almost no one knows this feature ever existed, and it's a vestigial feature of the days when the ideal for npm was to distribute full packages that could be directly developed on, even from the registry.

It turns out the npm community decided to go a different way: primarily publishing packages in a production-ready format, with no tests, build tools, etc. And so, we say goodbye to `npat`.

#### NEW `prepare` SCRIPT. `prepublish` DEPRECATED (**BREAKING**)

If there's anything that really seemed to confuse users, it's that the `prepublish` script ran when invoking `npm install` without any arguments.

Turns out many, many people really expected that it would only run on `npm publish`, even if it actually did what most people expected: prepare the package for publishing on the registry.

And so, we've added a `prepare` command that runs in the exact same cases where `prepublish` ran, and we've begun a deprecation cycle for `prepublish` itself **only when run by `npm install`**, which will now include a warning any time you use it that way.

We've also added a `prepublishOnly` script which will execute **only** when `npm publish` is invoked. Eventually, `prepublish` will stop executing on `npm install`, and `prepublishOnly` will be removed, leaving `prepare` and `prepublish` as two distinct lifecycles.

#### NO MORE PARTIAL SHRINKWRAPS (**BREAKING**)

That's right. No more partial shrinkwraps. That means that if you have an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` in your project, npm will no longer install anything that isn't explicitly listed there, unless it's a `devDependency`. This will open doors to some nice optimizations and make use of `npm shrinkwrap` just generally smoother by removing some awful corner cases.

4329848,2016-10-07T04:32:58Z,2016-10-07T04:45:23Z,,"Hi everyone! This is the last of our monthly releases. We're going to give an every-two-weeks schedule a try starting with our next release. We'll reevaluate in a quarter, but we suspect that will be what we'll stick with. You might be wondering _why_ we've been fiddling with the release cadence? Well, we've been trying to tune it to to minimize the overhead for our little team.

This is ALSO the ULTIMATE release of `npm` version 3. That's right, in just two weeks' time (October 20th for you fans of calendar time), our dear `npm` will be hitting the big 4.0.

**DON'T PANIC**

This is gonna be a much, MUCH smaller major version than 3.x was. Maybe even smaller than 2.x was. I can't tell you everything that'll be in there just yet, but at the very least it's going to have what's in our [4.x milestone](https://github.com/npm/npm/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A4.x), PLUS, the first steps in [making `prepublish` work](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10074) the way people expect it to.

**NOW ABOUT THIS RELEASE**

This release sees a whole slew of bug fixes. Notably a bunch of lifecycle fixes and a really important shrinkwrap fix.

#### LIFECYCLE FIXES
- [`d388f90`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d388f90732981633b3cdb4fc7fb0fababd4e64ab) [#13942](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13942) Fix current working directory while running shrinkwrap lifecycle scripts. Previously if you ran a shrinkwrap from another lifecycle script AND `node_modules` existed (and if you're running `npm shrinkwrap` it probably should) then `npm` would run the shrinkwrap lifecycle from the `node_modules` folder instead of the package folder. ([@evocateur](https://github.com/evocateur)) ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
- [`c3b6cdf`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/c3b6cdfedcdb4d9e7712be5245d9b274828d88d1) [#13964](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13964) Fix bug where the `uninstall` lifecycles weren't being run when you reinstalled/updated an existing module. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
- [`72bb89c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/72bb89c1aa9811a18cbd766f3da73da76eb920c6) [#13344](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13344) When running lifecycles use `TMPDIR` if it's writable and fall back to the current working directory if not. Previously we just assumed `TMPDIR` wouldn't be writable (as we might have been running as `nobody` and `nobody` on some systems can't write to `TMPDIR`). ([@aaronjensen](https://github.com/aaronjensen))

#### SHRINKWRAP GIT & TAGGED DEPENDENCY FIX
- [`3b5eee0`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3b5eee0d31737d1c2518ed95dcc7aaaaa93c253c) [#13941](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13941) Fix git and tagged dependency matching with shrinkwraps. Previously git and tag (ie `foo@latest`) dependencies installed from a shrinkwrap would always be flagged as invalid. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### BUG FIXES
- [`bf3bd1e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/bf3bd1e4347ee2c5de08d23558c4444749178c8b) [#14143](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14143) Fix bug in `npm version` where `npm-shrinkwrap.json` wouldn't be updated if you ran `npm version` from outside of your project root. ([@lholmquist](https://github.com/lholmquist))
- [`1089878`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1089878f58977559414c8a9addfc69a9c68905b0) [#13613](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13613) Log 'skipping action' as 'verbose' instead of 'warn'. This removes a lot of clutter when there are links in your `node_modules`. The long term plan is to entirely blind `npm` to what's inside links, which will make this code go away entirely. ([@timoxley](https://github.com/timoxley))
- [`952f1e1`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/952f1e109a070ab4066179f6104ba9394300e342) [#13999](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13999) Fix a bug where setting `bin` to `null` in your `package.json` would result in `npm` crashing. ([@IonicaBizau](https://github.com/IonicaBizau))
- [`fcf8b11`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/fcf8b11fb7fcf8902f6a887c3d5f0aef2897dde0) [#14032](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14032) When using `npm view`, if you specified a version that didn't exist it would previously print `undefined` (even if you asked for JSON output). It now prints nothing in this situation. This brings `npm@3`'s behavior in line with `npm@2`. ([@roblg](https://github.com/roblg))
- [`93c689f`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/93c689ff44c6042a2dcde7fe0d74d2264237d666) [#14032](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14032) When using `npm view --json` with a version range that matches multiple versions we now return a list of all of the metadata for all of those versions. Previously we picked one and only returned that. This brings `npm@3`'s behavior in line with `npm@2`. ([@roblg](https://github.com/roblg))
- [`2411728`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/24117289e09c373b845150c45e4793d98fe7cf4b) [#14045](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14045) Fix a Windows-only bug in the `git` tests. The tests had rather particular ideas about what arguments would be passed to `git` and on Windows they got this wrong. ([@watilde](https://github.com/watilde))

4086688,2016-09-09T02:47:59Z,2016-09-09T03:23:58Z,,"On we go with our monthly release cadence! This week is pretty much all dependency updates and some documentation changes, as can be expected by now.

Note that `npm@4` will almost certainly be released next month! It's not final what we'll end up doing as far as LTS support goes, but the current thinking is that, considering how small and resource-constrained our team is, support for `npm@2` will be reduced to essentially maintenance, so we can better focus on `npm@3` as the new LTS version (which will go into `node@6`), and `npm@4` as our next main development version.

4086302,2016-09-09T01:21:47Z,2016-09-09T01:30:45Z,,"Monthly releases are so big! Just look at all this stuff!

Our quarter of monthly releases is almost over. The next one, in October, might very well be our last one as we move to trying something different and learning lessons from our little experiment.

You may also want to keep an eye our for `npm@4` next month, since we're planning on finally releasing it then and including a (small) number of breaking changes we've been meaning to do for a long time. Don't worry, though: `npm@3` will still be around for a bit and will keep getting better and better, and is most likely going to be the version that `node@6` uses once it goes to LTS.

As some of us have mentioned before, npm is likely to start doing more regular semver-major bumps, while keeping those bumps significantly smaller than the huge effort that was `npm@3` -- we're not very likely to do a world-shaking thing like that for a while, if ever.

All that said, let's move on to the patches included in v3.10.8!

#### SHRINKWRAP LEVEL UP

The most notable part of this release is a series of commits meant to make `npm shrinkwrap` more consistent. By itself, shrinkwrap seems like a fairly straightforward thing to implement, but things get complicated when it starts interacting with `devDependencies`, `optionalDependencies`, and `bundledDependencies`. These commits address some corner cases related to these.
- [`a7eca32`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/a7eca3246fbbcbb05434cb6677f65d14c945d74f) [#10073](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10073) Record if a dependency is only used as a devDependency and exclude it from the shrinkwrap file. ([@bengl](https://github.com/bengl))
- [`1eabcd1`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1eabcd16bf2590364ca20831096350073539bf3a) [#10073](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10073) Record if a dependency is optional to shrinkwrap. ([@bengl](https://github.com/bengl))
- [`03efc89`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/03efc89522c99ee0fa37d8f4a99bc3b44255ef98) [#13692](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13692/) We were doing a weird thing where we used a `package.json` field `installable` to check to see if we'd checked for platform compatibility, and if not did so. But this was the only place that was ever done so there was no reason to implement it in such an obfuscated manner. Instead it now just directly checks and then records that its done so on the node object with `knownInstallable`. This is useful to know because modules expanded via shrinkwrap don't go through this– `inflateShrinkwrap` does not currently have any rollback semantics and so checking this sort of thing there is unhelpful. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
- [`ff87938`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/ff879382fda21dac7216a5f666287b3a7e74a947) [#11735](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/11735) Running `npm install --save-dev` will now update shrinkwrap file, but only if there already are devDependencies in it. ([@szimek](https://github.com/szimek))
- [`c00ca3a`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/c00ca3aef836709eeaeade91c5305bc2fbda2e8a) [#13394](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13394) Check installability of modules from shrinkwrap, since modules that came into the tree vie shrinkwrap won't already have this information recorded in advance. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### INSTALLER ERROR REPORTING LEVEL UP

As part of the shrinkwrap push, there were also a lot of error-reporting improvements. Some to add more detail to error objects, others to fix bugs and inconsistencies.
- [`2cdd713`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2cdd7132abddcc7f826a355c14348ce9a5897ffe) Consistently set code on `ETARGET` when fetching package metadata if no compatible version is found. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### MISCELLANEOUS BUGS LEVEL UP
- [`116b6c6`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/116b6c60a174ea0cc49e4d62717e4e26175b6534) [#13456](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13456) In lifecycle scripts, any `node_modules/.bin` existing in the hierarchy should be turned into an entry in the PATH environment variable. However, prior to this commit, it was splitting based on the string `node_modules`, rather than restricting it to only path portions like `/node_modules/` or `\node_modules\`. So, a path containing an entry like `my_node_modules` would be improperly split. ([@isaacs](https://github.com/isaacs))

Hi all, today's our first release coming out of the new monthly release cadence. See below for details. We're all recovered from conferences now and raring to go! We've got some pretty keen bug fixes and a bunch of documentation and dependency updates. It's hard to narrow it down to just a few, but of note are scoped packages in bundled dependencies, the `preinstall` lifecycle fix, the shrinkwrap and Git dependencies fix and the fix to a crasher involving cycles in development dependencies.

#### NEW RELEASE CADENCE

Releasing npm has been, for the most part, a very prominent part of our weekly process process. As part of our efforts to find the most effective ways to allocate our team's resources, we decided last month that we would try and slow our releases down to a monthly cadence, and see if we found ourselves with as much extra time and attention as we expected to have. Process experiments are useful for finding more effective ways to do our work, and we're at least going to keep doing this for a whole quarter, and then measure how well it worked out. It's entirely likely that we'll switch back to a more frequent cadence, specially if we find that the value that weekly cadence was providing the community is not worth sacrificing for a bit of extra time. Does this affect you significantly? Let us know!

#### SCOPED PACKAGES IN BUNDLED DEPENDENCIES

Prior to this release and [v2.15.10](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/v2.15.10), npm had ignored scoped modules found in `bundleDependencies`.
- [`29cf56d`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/29cf56dbae8e3dd16c24876f998051623842116a) [#8614](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8614) Include scoped packages in bundled dependencies. ([@forivall](https://github.com/forivall))

#### `preinstall` LIFECYCLE IN CURRENT PROJECT
- [`b7f13bc`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/b7f13bc80b89b025be0c53d81b90ec8f2cebfab7) [#13259](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13259) Run top level preinstall before installing dependencies ([@palmerj3](https://github.com/palmerj3))

#### BETTER SHRINKWRAP WITH GIT DEPENDENCIES
- [`0f7e319`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/0f7e3197bcec7a328b603efdffd3681bbc40f585) [#12718](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12718.) Update outdated git dependencies found in shrinkwraps. Previously, if the module version was the same then no update would be completed even if the committish had changed. ([@kossnocorp](https://github.com/kossnocorp))

#### CYCLES IN DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES NO LONGER CRASH
- [`1691de6`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1691de668d34cd92ab3de08bf3a06085388f2f07) [#13327](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13327) Fix bug where cycles found in development dependencies could result in infinite recursion that resulted in crashes. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### IMPROVE ""NOT UPDATING LINKED MODULE"" WARNINGS
- [`1619871`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1619871ac0cc8839dc9962c78e736095976c1eb4) [#12893](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12893) Only warn about symlink update if version number differs The update-linked action outputs a warning that it needs to update the linked package, but can't, There is no need for the package to be updated if it is already at the correct version. This change does a check before logging the warning. ([@DaveEmmerson](https://github.com/DaveEmmerson))

#### MORE BUG FIXES
- [`8f8d1b3`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/8f8d1b33a78c79aff9de73df362abaa7f05751d2) [#11398](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/11398) Fix bug where `package.json` files that contained a `type` property could cause crashes. `type` is not a `package.json` property that npm makes use of and having it should be (and now is) harmless.

- [`e7fa6c6`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/e7fa6c6a2c1de2a214479daa8c6901eebb350381) [#13353](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13353) Add GIT_EXEC_PATH to Git environment whitelist. ([@mhart](https://github.com/mhart))

#### INCLUDE `npm login` IN COMMAND SUMMARY
- [`ab0c4b1`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/ab0c4b137b05762e75e0913038b606f087b58aa0) [#13581](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13581) The `login` command has long been an alias for `adduser`. At the same time, there is an expectation not just of that particular word being something to look for, but of there being clear symmetry with `logout`. So it was a bit confusing when `login` didn't show up in `npm help` on a technicality. This seems like an acceptable exception to the rule that says ""no aliases in `npm help`"".

Hi all, today's our first release coming out of the new monthly release cadence. See below for details. We're all recovered from conferences now and raring to go! For LTS we see some bug fixes, documentation improvements and a host of dependency updates.

The most dramatic bug fix is probably the inclusion of scoped modules in bundled dependencies. Prior to this release and [v3.10.7](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/v3.10.7), npm had ignored scoped modules found in `bundleDependencies` entirely.

#### NEW RELEASE CADENCE

Releasing npm has been, for the most part, a very prominent part of our weekly process process. As part of our efforts to find the most effective ways to allocate our team's resources, we decided last month that we would try and slow our releases down to a monthly cadence, and see if we found ourselves with as much extra time and attention as we expected to have. Process experiments are useful for finding more effective ways to do our work, and we're at least going to keep doing this for a whole quarter, and then measure how well it worked out. It's entirely likely that we'll switch back to a more frequent cadence, specially if we find that the value that weekly cadence was providing the community is not worth sacrificing for a bit of extra time. Does this affect you significantly? Let us know!

#### SHRINKWRAP AND DEV DEPENDENCIES

#### RACES AS WACKY AS [REDLINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redline_%282009_film%29)

Races are notoriously hard to squash, and tend to be some of the more common recurring bugs we see on the CLI. [@julianduque](https://github.com/julianduque) did some pretty awesome [sleuthing work](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12669) to track down a cache race and helpfully submitted a patch. There were some related races in the same area that also got fixed at around the same time, mostly affecting Windows users.
- [`2a37c97`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2a37c97121483db2b6f817fe85c2a5a77b76080e) [#12669](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12669) [#13023](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13023) The CLI is pretty aggressive about correcting permissions across the cache whenever it writes to it. This aggressiveness caused a couple of races where temporary cache files would get picked up by `fs.readdir`, and removed before `chownr` was called on them, causing `ENOENT` errors. While the solution might seem a bit hamfisted, it's actually perfectly safe and appropriate in this case to just ignore those resulting `ENOENT` errors. ([@julianduque](https://github.com/julianduque))
- [`ea018b9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/ea018b9e3856d1798d199ae3ebce4ed07eea511b) [#13023](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13023) If a user were to have SUDO_UID and SUDO_GID, they'd be able to get into a pretty weird state. This fixes that corner case. ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))
- [`703ca3a`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/703ca3abbf4f1cb4dff08be32acd2142d5493482) [#13023](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13023) A missing `return` was causing `chownr` to be called on Windows, even though that's literally pointless, and causing crashes in the process, instead of short-circuiting. This was entirely dependent on which callback happened to be called first, and in some cases, the failing one would win the race. This should prevent this from happening in the future.

#### SHRINKWRAP IS COMPLICATED BUT IT'S BETTER NOW

[@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) did some heroic hacking to refactor a bunch of `shrinkwrap`-related bits and fixed some resolution and pathing issues that were biting users. The code around that stuff got more readable/maintainable in the process, too!
- [`346bba1`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/346bba1e1fee9cc814b07c56f598a73be5c21686) [#13214](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13214) Resolve local dependencies in `npm-shrinkwrap.json` relative to the top of the tree. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

If not, it'll use the version found in your `package.json`, and failing _that_, use `latest`.

Given that we had not one, but two updates to our RC this past week, it should come as no surprise that this week's full release is a bit lighter. We have some documentation patches and a couple of bug fixes via dependency updates.

If you haven't yet checked out last week's release, [v3.10.0](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.10.0) and the two follow up releases [v3.10.1](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.10.1) and [v3.10.2](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.10.2), you really should do so. They're the most important releases we've had in quite a while, fixing a bunch of critical bugs (including an issue impacting publishing with Node.js 6.x) and of course, bringing in the new and improved progress bar.

#### BUM SYMLINKS BURN NO MORE

There's been a bug lurking where broken symlinks in your `node_modules` folder could cause all manner of mischief, from crashes to empty `npm ls` results. The intrepid [@watilde](https://github.com/watilde) tracked this down for us.

This addresses the root cause of the outdated crasher we protected against earlier this week in [#13115](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13115).

This also fixes [#9564](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9564), the problem where a bad symlink in your global modules would result in an empty result when you ran `npm ls -g`.

This ALSO likely fixes numerous ""Missing argument #1"" errors. (But surely not all of them as that's actually just a generic arity and type-validation failure.)

There's a very important bug fix and a long-awaited (and significant!) deprecation in this hotfix release. [Hold on.](http://butt.holdings/)

#### _WHOA_

When Node.js 6.0.0 was released, the CLI team noticed an alarming upsurge in bugs related to important files (like `README.md`) not being included in published packages. The new bugs looked much like [#5082](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5082), which had been around in one form or another since April, 2014. #5082 used to be a very rare (and obnoxious) bug that the CLI team hadn't had much luck reproducing, and we'd basically marked it down as a race condition that arose on machines using slow and / or rotating-media-based hard drives.

Under 6.0.0, the behavior was reliable enough to be nearly deterministic, and made it very difficult for publishers using `.npmignore` files in combination with `""files""` stanzas in `package.json` to get their packages onto the registry without one or more files missing from the packed tarball. The entire saga is contained within [the issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5082), but the summary is that an improvement to the performance of [`fs.realpath()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_realpath_path_options_callback) made it much more likely that the packing code would lose the race.

Fixing this has proven to be very difficult, in part because the code used by npm to produce package tarballs is more complicated than, strictly speaking, it needs to be. [**@evanlucas**](https://github.com/evanlucas) contributed [a patch](https://github.com/npm/fstream/pull/50) that passed the tests in a [special test suite](https://github.com/othiym23/eliminate-5082) that I ([**@othiym23**](https://github.com/othiym23)) created (with help from [**@addaleax**](https://github.com/addaleax)), but only _after_ we'd released the fixed version of that package did we learn that it actually made the problem _worse_ in other situations in npm proper. Eventually, [**@rvagg**](https://github.com/rvagg) put together a more durable fix that appears to completely address the errant behavior under Node.js 6.0.0. That's the patch included in this release. Everybody should chip in for redback insurance for Rod and his family; he's done the community a huge favor.

Does this mean the long (2+ year) saga of #5082 is now over? At this point, I'm going to quote from my latest summary on the issue:

> The CLI team (mostly me, with input from the rest of the team) has decided that the overall complexity of the interaction between `fstream`, `fstream-ignore`, `fstream-npm`, and `node-tar` has grown more convoluted than the team is comfortable (maybe even capable of) supporting.
> - While I believe that @rvagg's (very targeted) fix addresses _this_ issue, I would be shocked if there aren't other race conditions in npm's packing logic. I've already identified a couple other places in the code that are most likely race conditions, even if they're harder to trigger than the current one.
> - The way that dependency bundling is integrated leads to a situation in which a bunch of logic is duplicated between `fstream-npm` and `lib/utils/tar.js` in npm itself, and the way `fstream`'s extension mechanism works makes this difficult to clean up. This caused a nasty regression ([#13088](https://github.com/npm/fstream/pull/50), see below) as of ~`npm@3.8.7` where the dependencies of `bundledDependencies` were no longer being included in the built package tarballs.
> - The interaction between `.npmignore`, `.gitignore`, and `files` is hopelessly complicated, scattered in many places throughout the code. We've been discussing [making the ignores and includes logic clearer and more predictable](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Files-and-Ignores), and the current code fights our efforts to clean that up.
> 
> So, our intention is still to replace `fstream`, `fstream-ignore`, and `fstream-npm` with something much simpler and purpose-built. There's no real reason to have a stream abstraction here when a simple recursive-descent filesystem visitor and a synchronous function that can answer whether a given path should be included in the packed tarball would do the job adequately.
> 
> What's not yet clear is whether we'll need to replace `node-tar` in the process. `node-tar` is a very robust implementation of tar (it handles, like, everything), and it also includes some very important tweaks to prevent several classes of security exploits involving maliciously crafted packages. However, its packing API involves passing in an `fstream` instance, so we'd either need to produce something that follows enough of `fstream`'s contract for `node-tar` to keep working, or swap `node-tar` out for something like `tar-stream` (and then ensuring that our use of `tar-stream` is secure, which could involve security patches for either npm or `tar-stream`).

The testing and review of `fstream@1.0.10` that the team has done leads us to believe that this bug is fixed, but I'm feeling more than a little paranoid about fstream now, so it's important that people keep a close eye on their publishes for a while and let us know immediately if they notice any irregularities.

#### GOODBYE, FAITHFUL FRIEND

At NodeConf Adventure 2016 (RIP in peace, Mikeal Rogers's NodeConf!), the CLI team had an opportunity to talk to representatives from some of the larger companies that we knew were still using Node.js 0.8 in production. After asking them whether they were still using 0.8, we got back blank stares and questions like, ""0.8? You mean, from four years ago?"" After establishing that being able to run npm in their legacy environments was no longer necessary, the CLI team made the decision to drop support for 0.8. (Faithful observers of our [team meetings](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+npm+cli+team+meeting+) will have known this was the plan for NodeConf since the beginning of 2016.)

In practice, this means only what's in the commit below: we've removed 0.8 from our continuous integration test matrix below, and will no longer be habitually testing changes under Node 0.8.  We may also give ourselves permission to use `setImmediate()` in test code. However, since the project still supports Node.js 0.10 and 0.12, it's unlikely that patches that rely on ES 2015 functionality will land anytime soon.

Looking forward, the team's current plan is to drop support for Node.js 0.10 when its LTS maintenace window expires in October, 2016, and 0.12 when its maintenance / LTS window ends at the end of 2016. We will also drop support for Node.js 5.x when Node.js 6 becomes LTS and Node.js 7 is released, also in the October-December 2016 timeframe.

(Confused about Node.js's LTS policy? [Don't be!](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) If you look at [this diagram](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/blob/ce364a94b0e0619eba570cd57be396573e1ef889/schedule.png), it should make all of the preceding clear.)

If, in practice, this doesn't work with distribution packagers or other community stakeholders responsible for packaging and distributing Node.js and npm, please reach out to us. Aligning the npm CLI's LTS policy with Node's helps everybody minimize the amount of work they need to do, and since all of our teams are small and very busy, this is somewhere between a necessity and non-negotiable.

#### _ERK_

Because the interaction between `fstream`, `fstream-ignore`, `fsream-npm`, and `node-tar` is so complex, it's proven difficult to add support for npm features like `bundledDependencies` without duplicating some logic within npm's code base. While [fixing a completely unrelated bug](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9642), we ""cleaned up"" some of this seemingly duplicated code, and in the process removed the code that ensured that the dependencies of `bundledDependencies` are themselves bundled. We've brought that code back into the code base (without reopening #9642), and added a test to ensure that this regression can't recur.

Do we have a release for you! We have our first new lifecycle since `version`, a new progress bar and a bunch of bug fixes. [I'm](https://github.com/iarna) really excited about this release, let me tell you!!

#### DANGER: PUBLISHING ON NODE 6.0.0

Publishing and packing are buggy under Node versions greater than 6.0.0. Please use Node.js LTS (4.4.x) to publish packages. See [#5082](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5082) for details and current status.

#### NEW LIFECYCLE SCRIPT: `shrinkwrap`
- [`e8c80f2`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/e8c80f20bfd5d1618e85dbab41660d6f3e5ce405) [#10744](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10744) You can now add `preshrinkwrap`, `shrinkwrap` and `postshrinkwrap` to your `package.json` scripts section. They are run when you run `npm shrinkwrap` or `npm install --save` with an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` present in your module directory.
  
  `preshrinkwrap` is run prior to generating the new `npm-shrinkwrap.json` and the other two are run after. ([@SimenB](https://github.com/SimenB))

#### NEW PROGRESS BAR

![Install with new progress bar](http://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc-images/new-gauge-color.gif)

We have a new progress bar and a bunch of related improvements!

##### BLOCKING BLOCKING

**!!WARNING!!** As a part of this change we now explicitly set `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` to be _blocking_ if they are ttys, using [set-blocking](https://www.npmjs.com/package/set-blocking). This is necessary to ensure that we can fully erase the progress bar before we start writing other things out to the console.

Prior to Node.js 6.0.0, they were already blocking on Windows, and MacOS. Meanwhile, on Linux they were always non-blocking but had large (64kb) buffers, which largely made this a non-issue there. Starting with Node.js 6.0.0 they became non-blocking on MacOS and that caused some unexpected issues (see [nodejs/node#6456](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/6456)).

If you are a Linux user, it's plausible that this might have a performance impact if your terminal can't keep up with output rate. If you experience this, we want to know! Please [file an issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/new) at our issue tracker.

##### BETTER LAYOUT

Let's start by talking about what goes into the new progress bar:

 percent complete     spinner    current thing we're doing     most recent log line
```

The _spinner_ is intended as an activity indicator–it moves whenever npm sends something to its logs. It also spins at a constant speed while waiting on the network.

The _current thing we're doing_ relates to how we track how much work has been done. It's the name of the unit of work we most recently started or completed some of. Sometimes these names are more obvious than others and that's something we'll look at improving over time.

And finally, the _most recent log line_ is exactly that, it's the most recent line that you would have seen if you were running with `--loglevel=silly` or were watching the `npm-debug.log`. These are written to be useful to the npm developers above all else, so they may sometimes be a little cryptic.
- [`6789978`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/6789978ab0713f67928177a9109fed43953ccbda) [#13075](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13075) `npmlog@3.1.2`: Update to the latest npmlog, which includes the new and improved progress bar layout. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

##### MORE PERFORMANT

The underlying code for the progress bar was rewritten, in part with performance in mind. Previously whenever you updated the progress bar it would check an internal variable for how long it had been since the last update and if it had been long enough, it would print out what you gave it. With the new progress bar we do updates at a fixed interval (with `setInterval`) and ""updating"" the progress bar just updates some variables that will be used when the next tick of the progress bar happens. Currently progress bar updates happen every 50ms, although that's open to tuning.

##### WIDE(R) COMPATIBILITY

I spent a lot of time working our Unicode support. There were a few issues that plagued us:

Previously one of the characters we used was _ambiguous width_ which means that it was possible to configure your terminal to display it as _full width_. If you did this, the output would be broken because we assumed it was a _half width_ character. We no longer use any of these characters.

Previously, we defaulted to using Unicode on Windows. This isn't a safe assumption, however, as folks in non-US locales often use other code pages for their terminals. Windows doesn't provide\* any facility available to Node.js for determining the current code page, so we no longer try to use Unicode on Windows.

_* The facilities it does provide are a command line tool and a windows system call. The former isn't satisfactory for speed reasons and the latter can't be accessed from a JS-only Node.js program._

##### FOR THE FUTURE: THEMES

The new version of the progress bar library supports plugable themes. Adding support to npm shouldn't be too difficult. The built in themes are:
- `ASCII` – The fallback theme which is always available.
- `colorASCII` – Inverts the color of the completed portion of the progress bar. The default on Windows and usually on Linux. (Color support is determined by looking at the `TERM` environment variable.)
- `brailleSpinner` – A braille based spinner and other unicode enhancements. MacOS only.
- `colorBrailleSpinner` – The default on MacOS, a combination of the above two.

##### LESS GARBLED OUTPUT

As a part of landing this I've also taken the opportunity to more systematically disable the progress bar prior to printing to `stdout` or running external commands (in particular: git). This should ensure that the progress bar doesn't get left on screen after something else prints something. We also are now much more zealous about erasing the progress bar on exit, so if you `Ctrl-C` out of an install we'll still cleanup the progress bar.

- [`8da79fa`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/8da79fa60de4972dca406887623d4e430d1609a1) [#13075](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/13075) Be more methodical about disabling progress bars before running external commands. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### REPLACE `process.nextTick` WITH `asap` ASAP
- [`5873b56`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/5873b56cb315437dfe97e747811c0b9c297bfd38) [`254ad7e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/254ad7e38f978b81046d242297fe8b122bfb5852) [#12754](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12754) Use `asap` in preference over `process.nextTick` to avoid recursion warnings. Under the hood `asap` uses `setImmediate` when available and falls back to `process.nextTick` when it's not. Versions of node that don't support `setImmediate` have a version of `process.nextTick` that actually behaves like the current `setImmediate`. ([@lxe](https://github.com/lxe))

#### FIXES AND REFACTORING

Sometimes the installer would get it into its head that it could move or remove things that it really shouldn't have. While the reproducers for this were often a bit complicated (the core reproducer involved five symlinks(!)), it turns out this is an easy scenario to end up in if your project has a bunch of small modules and you're linking them while developing them.

Fixing this ended up involving doing an important and overdue rewrite of how the installer keeps track of (and interrogates) the relationships between modules. This likely fixes other related bugs, and in the coming weeks we'll verify and close them as we find them. There are a whole slew of commits related to this rewrite, and if you'd like to learn more check out the PR where I describe what I did in detail: [#12775](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12775)

This is NOT related to `npm prune`. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

A quick note on last week's release: We had a small `npm shrinkwrap`-related crasher in `npm@3.9.1`, so once this  release goes out, `v3.9.2` is going to be `npm@latest`. Please update if you ended up in with that previous version!

Remember we have a weekly team meeting, and you can [suggest agenda items in the GitHub issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12761). Keep an eye out for the `#npmweekly` tag on Twitter, too, and join the conversation! We'll do our best to address questions y'all send us. ✌

HI all! We have bug fixes to a couple of the hairy corners of `npm`, in the form of shrinkwraps and bundled dependencies. Plus some documentation improvements and our lodash deps bot a bump.

This is our first week really focused on getting the [big bugs](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label:big-bug) list down. Our work from this week will be landing next week, and I can't wait to tell you about that! (It's about symlinks!)

#### SHRINKWRAP FIX

Wow! This is a big release week! We've completed the fixes that let the test suite pass on Windows, plus more general bug fixes we found while fixing things on Windows. Plus a warning to help folks work around a common footgun. PLUS an improvement to how npm works with long cache timeouts.

#### INFINITE CACHE A LITTLE BETTER
- [`111ae3e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/111ae3ec366ece7ebcf5988f5bc2a7cd70737dfe) [#8581](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8581) When a package is fetched from the cache which cannot satisfy the version requirements, an attempt to fetch it from the network is made. This is helpful for folks using high values for `--cache-min` who are willing to accept possibly not-the-most-recent modules in return for less network traffic. ([@Zirak](https://github.com/Zirak))

#### WARNING: FOOTGUN
- [`60b9a05`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/60b9a051aa46b8892fe63b3681839a6fd6642bfd) [#12475](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12475) Options can only start with ASCII dashes. Ordinarily this isn't a problem but many web documentation tools ""helpfully"" convert `--` into an emdash (–), or `-` into an endash (–). If you copy and paste from this documentation your commands won't work the way you expect. This adds a warning that tries to be a little more descriptive about why your command is failing. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### WINDOWS CI

We have [Windows CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/npm/npm) setup now! We still have to tweak it a little bit around paths to the git binaries, but it's otherwise ready!
- [`bb5d6cb`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/bb5d6cbf46b2609243d3b384caadd196e665a797) [#11444](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444) Add AppVeyor to CI matrix. ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

#### COVERAGE DATA

Not only do our tests produce coverage reports after they run now, we also automatically [update Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/npm/npm) with results from [Travis CI](travis-ci.org/npm/npm) runs.
- [`044cbab`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/044cbab0d49adeeb0d9310c64fee6c9759cc7428) [#11444](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444) Enable coverage reporting for every test run. ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

#### EVERYONE BUGS
- [`37c6a51`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/37c6a51c71b0feec8f639b3199a8a9172e58deec) [#12150](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12150) Ensure that 'npm cache ls' outputs real filenames.

- [`e928a30`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/e928a30947477a09245f54e9381f46b97bee32d5) [#11444](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444) Make handling of local modules (eg `npm install /path/to/my/module`) more consistent when saved to a `package.json`. There were bugs previously where it wouldn't consistently resolve relative paths in the same way. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
- [`b820ed4`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/b820ed4fc04e21577fa66f7c9482b5ab002e7985) [#11444](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444) Under certain circumstances the paths produced for linking, either relative or absolute, would end up basing off the wrong virtual cwd. This resulted in failures for `npm link` in these situations. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### WINDOWS BUGS
- [`7380425`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/7380425d810fb8bfc69405a9cbbdec19978a7bee) [#11444](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444) Scoped module names were not being correctly inferred from the path on Windows. ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))
- [`91fc24f`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/91fc24f2763c2e0591093099ffc866c735f27fde) [#11444](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444) Explore with a command to run didn't work properly in Windows– it would pop open a new cmd window and leave it there. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### WINDOWS REFACTORING
- [`f07e643`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f07e6430d4ca02f811138f6140a8bad927607a1f) [#11444](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444) Move exec path escaping out to its own function. This turns out to be tricky to get right because how you escape commands to run on Windows via cmd is different then how you escape them at other times. Specifically, you HAVE to quote each directory segment that has a quote in it, that is: `C:\""Program Files""\MyApp\MyApp.exe` By contrast, if that were an argument to a command being run, you CAN'T DO quote it that way, instead you have to wrap the entire path in quotes, like so: `""C:\Program Files\MyApp\MyApp.exe""`. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
- [`2e01d29`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2e01d299f8244134b1aa040cab1b59c72c9df4da) [#11444](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444) Create a single function for detecting if we're running on Windows (and using a Windows shell like cmd) and use this instead of doing it one-off all over the place. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

Our biggest news this week is that we got the [Windows test suite passing](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444)!  It'll take a little longer to get it passing in our [Windows CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/npm/npm/) but that's coming soon too.

That means we'll be shifting gears away from tests to fixing [Big Bugs™](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abig-bug) again.  Join us at our [team meeting](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12517) next Tuesday to learn more about that.

Hi all! Long time no see! We've been heads-down working through getting [our test suite passing on Windows](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444). Did you know that we have [Windows CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/npm/npm) now running over at Appveyor? In the meantime, we've got a bunch of dependency updates, some nice documentation improvements and error messages when your `package.json` contains invalid JSON. (Yeah, I thought we did that last one before too!)

#### BAD JSON IS BAD

Gosh, it's been a peaceful couple of weeks!

Overall, the CLI team has been focused on the project to [get the test suite passing on Windows](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444). Our efforts should be paying off soon -- there's only a couple of tests left!

It's very unlikely those particular changes will make their way into our current `npm@2` LTS release, I think, but it will help `npm@3` a lot, as well as whatever version makes it into [`node@6`, which will eventually be the next Node.js LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/6155).

- [`9cfd56c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/9cfd56cdadc040c0b2fa7654cdb5e7d22dbef7cb) `fs-vacuum@1.2.9`: This one goes out to our fans at Big Blue: There was an AIX-specific issue where `fs.rmDir` was failing with `EEXIST` instead of `ENOTEMPTY` with non-empty directories.

  With `npm@3` such extraneously bundled modules would not be ordinarily used, as things in `node_modules` in packages are ignored entirely if the package isn't marked as bundling modules.

In that case, we were using `*` to mean ""deprecate all versions"" and relying on the `pkg` -> `pkg@*` conversion.

Kat here! Rebecca's been schmoozing with folks at [Microsoft Build](https://build.microsoft.com/), so I'm doing the `npm@3` release this week.

Speaking of Build, it looks like Microsoft is doing some bash thing. This might be really good news for our Windows users once it rolls around. We're keeping an eye out and feeling hopeful. 🙆

As far as the release goes: We're really happy to be getting more and more community contributions! Keep it up! We really appreciate folks trying to help us, and we'll do our best to help point you in the right direction. Even things like documentation are a huge help. And remember -- you get socks for it, too!

In that case, we were using `*` to mean ""deprecate all versions"" and relying on the `pkg` -> `pkg@*` conversion. This patch fixes `npm deprecate pkg` to work as it used to by special casing that particular command's behavior. ([@polm](https://github.com/polm))

There's also some small process changes to our LTS process relatively recently that you might wanna know about! 💁

For one, the `2.x` branch was removed in favor of just `lts`. If you're making PRs exclusively against npm's LTS, please use that name from now on. `2.x` was deleted.

Also, [@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) put some time into [writing down our LTS process and policy](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/LTS). Check it out and ping us if you have questions or comments about it!

In general, we're trying to make sure all our policy and such for our contributors is written down, and we hope it makes it easier in general for y'all. Forrest is also working on a shiny new Contributor's Guide right now, but we'll link to that in the (near?) future, when it's ready to roll out.

#### SECURITY ADVISORY: BEARER TOKEN DISCLOSURE

This release includes [the fix for a vulnerability](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f67ecad59e99a03e5aad8e93cd1a086ae087cb29) that could cause the unintentional leakage of bearer tokens.

Here are details on this vulnerability and how it affects you.

##### DETAILS

Since 2014, npm’s registry has used HTTP bearer tokens to authenticate requests from the npm’s command-line interface. A design flaw meant that the CLI was sending these bearer tokens with _every_ request made by logged-in users, regardless of the destination of their request. (The bearers only should have been included for requests made against a registry or registries used for the current install.)

An attacker could exploit this flaw by setting up an HTTP server that could collect authentication information, then use this authentication information to impersonate the users whose tokens they collected. This impersonation would allow them to do anything the compromised users could do, including publishing new versions of packages.

With the fixes we’ve released, the CLI will only send bearer tokens with requests made against a registry.

##### THINK YOU'RE AT RISK? REGENERATE YOUR TOKENS

If you believe that your bearer token may have been leaked, [invalidate your current npm bearer tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens) and rerun `npm login` to generate new tokens. Keep in mind that this may cause continuous integration builds in services like Travis to break, in which case you’ll need to update the tokens in your CI server’s configuration.

##### WILL THIS BREAK MY CURRENT SETUP?

Maybe.

npm’s CLI team believes that the fix won’t break any existing registry setups. Due to the large number of registry software suites out in the wild, though, it’s possible our change will be breaking in some cases.

If so, please [file an issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/new) describing the software you’re using and how it broke. Our team will work with you to mitigate the breakage.

##### CREDIT & THANKS

Thanks to Mitar, Will White & the team at Mapbox, Max Motovilov, and James Taylor for reporting this vulnerability to npm.

#### PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

The updated [`are-we-there-yet`](https://npmjs.com/package/are-we-there-yet) changes how it tracks how complete things are to be much more efficient. The summary is that `are-we-there-yet` was refactored to remove an expensive tree walk.

The result for you should be faster installs when working with very large trees.

Previously `are-we-there-yet` computed this when you asked by passing the request down its tree of progress indicators, totaling up the results. In doing so, it had to walk the entire tree of progress indicators.

By contrast, `are-we-there-yet` now updates a running total when a change is made, bubbling that up the tree from whatever branch made progress. This bubbling was already going on so there was nearly no cost associated with taking advantage of it.

  ```

A brief note about LTS this week!

npm, as you may know if you're using this `2.x` branch, has an LTS process for releases. We also try and play nice with [Node.js' own LTS release process](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-plan). That means we generally try to avoid things like minor version bumps on our `2.x` branch (which is also tagged `lts` in the `dist-tag`s).

That said, we had a minor-bump update recently for `npm@3.8.0` which added a `maxsockets` option to allow users to configure the number of concurrent sockets that npm would keep open at a time -- a setting that has the potential to help a bunch for people with fussy routers or internet connections that aren't very happy with Node.js applications' usual concurrency storm. This change was done to `npm-registry-client`, which we don't have a parallel LTS-tracking branch for.

After talking it over, we ended up deciding that this was a reasonable enough addition to LTS, even though it's _technically_ a `semver-minor` bump, taking into account both its potential for bugfixing (specially on `2.x`!) and the general hassle it would be to maintain another branch for `npm-registry-client`.

This week the install summary got better, killing your npm process now also kills the scripts it was running and a rarely used search flag got documented.

Our improvements on the test suite on Windows are beginning to pick up steam, you can follow along by [watching the PR](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11444).

#### BETTER INSTALL SUMMARIES
- [`e40d457`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/e40d4572cc98db06757df5b8bb6b7dbd0546d3d7) [#11699](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/11699) Ensure that flags like `--production` passed to install don't result in the summary at the end being incorrectly filtered. That summary is produced by the same code as `npm ls` and therefore responds to flags the same way it does. This is undesirable when it's an install summary, however, as we don't want it to filter anything.
  
  This fixes an issue where `npm install --production <module>` would result in npm exiting with an error code. The `--production` flag would make `npm ls` filter out `<module>` as it wasn't saved to the `package.json` and thus wans't a production dependency. The install report is limited to show just the modules installed, so with that filtered out nothing is available. With nothing available `npm ls` would set `npm` to exit with an error code.

Previously it selected which modules from your tree to display based on `name@version` which worked great when your tree was deduped but would list things it hadn't touched when there were duplicates.

This week brings a quality of life improvement for some windows users, and an important knob to be tuned for folks experiencing network problems.

#### LIMIT CONCURRENT REQUESTS

We've long known that `npm`'s tendency to try to request all your dependencies simultaneously upset some network hardware (particular, consumer grade routers & proxies of all sorts). One of the reasons that we're planning to write our own npm specific version of `request` is to be able to more easily control this sort of thing.

But fortunately, you don't have to wait for that. [@misterbyrne](https://github.com/misterbyrne) took a look at our existing code and realized it could be added painlessly TODAY. The new default maximum is `50`, instead of `Infinity`. If you're having network issues you can try setting that value down to something lower (if you do, please let us know... the default is subject to tuning).

#### WHITTLING AWAY AT PATH LENGTHS

So for all of you who don't know -- Node.js does, in fact, support long Windows paths. Unfortunately, depending on the tool and the Windows version, a lot of external tooling does not. This means, for example, that some (all?) versions of Windows Explorer _can literally never delete npm from their system entirely because of deeply-nested npm dependencies_. Which is pretty gnarly.

Incidentally, if you run into that in particularly, you can use [rimraf](npm.im/rimraf) to remove such files 💁.

The latest victim of this issue was the Node.js CI setup for testing on Windows, which uses some tooling or another that croaks on the usual path length limit for that OS: 255 characters.

This isn't ordinarily an issue with `npm@3` as it produces mostly flat trees, but you may be surprised to learn that `npm`'s own distribution isn't flat, due to needing to be compatible with `npm@1.2`, which ships with `node@0.8`!

We've taken another baby step towards alleviating this in this release by updating a couple of dependencies that were preventing `npmlog` from deduping, and then doing a dedupe on that and `gauge`. Hopefully it helps.

This release also includes a particular dependency upgrade that makes it so we're exclusively using the latest version of `graceful-fs`, which'll make it so things keep working with future Node.js releases.

A certain internal Node.js API was deprecated and slated for future removal from Node Core. This API was critical for versions of `graceful-fs@<4`, before a different approach was used to achieve similar ends. By upgrading this library, and making sure all our dependencies are also updated, we've ensured npm will continue to work once the API is finally removed. Older versions of npm, on the other hand, will simply not work on future versions of Node.js.

Hi all! This week brings us some important performance improvements, support for git submodules(!) and a bunch of bug fixes.

#### PERFORMANCE

`gauge`, the module responsible for drawing `npm`'s progress bars, had an embarrassing bug in its debounce implementation that resulted in it, on many systems, actually being _slower_ than if it hadn't been debouncing. This was due to it destroying and then creating a timer object any time it got an update while waiting on its minimum update period to elapse. This only was a measurable slowdown when sending thousands of updates a second, but unfortunately parts of `npm`'s logging do exactly that. This has been patched to eliminate that churn, and our testing shows the progress bar as being eliminated as a source of slow down.

Meanwhile, `are-we-there-yet` is the module that tracks just how complete our big asynchronous install process is. [@STRML](https://github.com/STRML) spent some time auditing its source and made a few smaller performance improvements to it. Most impactful was eliminating a bizarre bit of code that was both binding to AND closing over the current object. I don't have any explanation for how that crept in. =D
- [`c680fa9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/c680fa9f8135759eb5512f4b86e47fa265733f79) `npmlog@2.0.2`: New `are-we-there-yet` with performance patches from [@STRML](https://github.com/STRML). New `gauge` with timer churn performance patch. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

We were also using `lodash`'s `cloneDeep` on `package.json` data which is definitely overkill, seeing as `package.json` data has all the restrictions of being `json`. The fix for this is just swapping that out for something that does a pair of `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`, which is distinctly more speedy.
- [`1d1ea7e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1d1ea7eeb958034878eb6573149aeecc686888d3) [#11306](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11306) Use JSON clone instead of `lodash.cloneDeep`. ([@STRML](https://github.com/STRML))

#### NEW FEATURE: GIT SUBMODULE SUPPORT

Long, long requested– the referenced issue is from 2011– we're finally getting rudimentary git submodule support.
- [`39dea9c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/39dea9ca4216c6ea628f5ca47d2b34a4b251a1ed) [#1876](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/1876) Add support for git submodules in git remotes. This is a fairly simple approach, which does not leverage the git caching mechanism to cache submodules. It also doesn't provide a means to disable automatic initialization, e.g. via a setting in the `.gitmodules` file. ([@gagern](https://github.com/gagern))

#### ROBUSTNESS
- [`5dec02a`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/5dec02a3d0e82202c021e27aff9d006283fdc25a) [#10347](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10347) There is an obscure feature that lets you monkey-patch npm when it starts up. If the module being required with this feature failed, it would previously just make `npm` error out– this reduces that to a warning. ([@evanlucas](https://github.com/evanlucas))

#### BUG FIXES
- [`9ab8b8d`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/9ab8b8d047792612ae7f9a6079745d51d5283a53) [#10820](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10820) Fix a bug with `npm ls` where if you asked for ONLY production dependencies in output it would exclude dependencies that were BOTH production AND development dependencies.

([@gagern](https://github.com/gagern))
- [`bbdc700`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/bbdc70024467c365cc4e06b8410947c04b6f145b) [#10063](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10063) Fix a bug where `npm` would change the order of array properties in the `package.json` files of dependencies. `npm` adds a bunch of stuff to `package.json` files in your `node_modules` folder for debugging and bookkeeping purposes. As a part of this process it sorts the object to reduce file churn when it does updates. This fixes a bug where the arrays in the object were also getting sorted. This wasn't a problem for properties that `npm` itself maintains, but _is_ a problem for properties used by other packages. ([@substack](https://github.com/substack))

Hi all! This is a bigger release, in part 'cause we didn't have one last week. The most important thing you need to know is that when `npm@3.6.0` replaces `npm@3.5.4` as `next`, `npm@3.5.4` WILL NOT be moved on to `latest`. This is due to a packaging error that tickles bugs in some earlier releases and makes upgrades to it from those versions break the install.

#### NEW FEATURES‼

This is in contrast to its normal use where `npm` _tells_ git about your new version. ([@ekmartin](https://github.com/ekmartin))

#### 3.5.4 WAS NOT SO GREAT

The `npm@3.5.4` package was missing some dependencies. Specifically, `glob` and `has-unicode` had major release updates which meant that subdeps that relied on older major versions couldn't use the npm supplied versions any more, and so they needed their own copies.

This went undetected because the actions necessary to run the tests (which check for this sort of thing) resolved the missing modules.

Further, it didn't have symptoms when upgrading from _most_ versions of npm. Unfortunately, some versions had bugs that were tickled by this and resulted in broken upgrades, most notably, `npm@3.3.12`, the version that's been in Node.js 5.
- [`1d3325c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1d3325c040621a4792db80fb232f4994b9d5c5f2) [`02611c6`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/02611c673a4d2bbe8fcef8d48407768da31c90d2) [`39d5fea`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/39d5feadefdde38d75a18f23343bc6ec37153638) [`7d0e830`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/7d0e830f26c73b9d9277b29949227ba9cca27fd9) [#11129](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11129) Update the underlying dependencies to allow use for the new versions of `glob` and `has-unicode`. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### WHEN MISSING PATHS ARE OK
- [`bb638fa`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/bb638fa4f48d24d2c9935861d5d751c5621eea49) [#11212](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11212) When trying to determine if a file was controlled by npm before going to remove it, we check to see if it is inside any of a list of paths that npm considers to be under its control. Not all of those paths always exist (and that's ok!) Previously we were calling it a failure to match if ANY of them didn't exist. We now only do so if NONE of them exist. If some do, then we do our usual checks on them.
  
  This showed up as an error where you would see something like:
  
  ```
  npm warn gentlyRm not removing /path/to/thing as it wasn't installed by /path/to/other/thing
  ```
  
  …but it totally was installed by it.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### BETTER NODE PRE-RELEASE SUPPORT

Historically, if you used a pre-release version of Node.js, you would get dozens and dozens of warnings when EVERY engine check failed across all of your modules, because `>= 0.10.0` doesn't match prereleases.

You might find this stream of redundent warnings undesirable. I do.

We've moved this into a SINGLE warning you'll get about using a pre-release version of Node.js and now suppress those other warnings.
- [`6952f79`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/6952f7981e451a2d599a4f513573af208bdfe103) [#11212](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11212) Engine check warnings are now issued along with any other warnings about your tree, instead of emitting in the middle of your install (and then disappearing behind the giant tree of stuff installed).

#### BUG FIXES
- [`ea331c8`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/ea331c82157c65f7643cd4b49fd24031c84bf601) [#10938](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10938) When removing a package, sometimes the `node_modules/.bin` wouldn't be cleaned up entirely. This would result in package folders that contained only a `node_modules/.bin` directory. In turn, this would result in `npm ls` and other tools complaining about these broken directories. To fix this, the `unbuild` step now explicitly deletes the `node_modules/.bin` folder as its final step. ([@chrisirhc](https://github.com/chrisirhc))
- [`00720db`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/00720db2c326cf8f968c662444a4575ae8c3020a) [#11158](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11158) On windows, the `node-gyp` wrapper would fail if your path to `node-gyp` contained spaces. This fixes that problem by quoting use of that path. ([@orangemocha](https://github.com/orangemocha))
- [`69ac933`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/69ac9333506752bf2e5af70b3b3e03c6181de3e7) [#11142](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/11142) Fix a race condition when making directories in the cache, which could lead to `ENOENT` failures. ([@Jimbly](https://github.com/Jimbly))
- [`e982858`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/e982858d9bed65cede9cbb12df9216a4bb9e6fc9) [#9696](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9696) When replacing the `package.json` in the cache you sometimes see `EPERM` errors on Windows that you wouldn't on Unix-like operating systems. This ignores those errors and allows Windows to continue. Longer term, we'll be adding something to retry these errors, but ultimately fail if there really is an ongoing permissions issue.

I hope you all had fantastic winter holidays, if it's winter where you are and if there are holidays‼ We went a few weeks without releases because staff was taking time away from work here and there.  A new year has come and we're back now, and refreshed and ready to dig in!

This week brings us a bunch of documentation improvements and some module updates.  The core team's focus continues to be on improving tests, particularly with Windows, so there's not too much to call out here.

#### ENOENT? MORE LIKE ENOMOREBUGS

The headliner this week was uncovered by the fixes to bundled dependency handling over the past few releases. What had been a frustratingly intermittent and hard to reproduce bug became something that happened every time in Travis. This fixes another whole bunch of errors where you would, while running an install have it crash with an `ENOENT` on `rename`, or the install would finish but some modules would be mysteriously missing and you'd have to install a second time.

What's going on was a bit involved, so bear with me:

`npm@3` generates a list of actions to take against the tree on disk. With the exception of lifecycle scripts, it expects these all to be able to act independently without interfering with each other.

This means, for instance, that one should be able to upgrade `b` in `a→b→c` without having npm reinstall `c`.

That works fine by the way.

But it also means that the move action should be able to move `b` in `a→b→c@1.0.1` to `a→d→b→c@1.0.2` without moving or removing `c@1.0.1` and while leaving `c@1.0.2` in place if it was already installed.

That is, the `move` action moves an individual node, replacing itself with an empty spot if it had children. This is not, as it might first appear, something where you move an entire branch to another location on the tree.

When moving `b` we already took care to leave `c@1.0.1` in place so that other moves (or removes) could handle it, but we were stomping on the destination and so `c@1.0.2` was being removed.
- [`f4385d8`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f4385d8e7678349e75c80fae8a1f8f366f197937) [#10655](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10655) Preserve destination `node_modules` when moving. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

There was also a bug with `remove` where it was pruning the entire tree at the remove point, prior to running moves and adds.

This was fine most of the time, but if we were moving one of the deps out from inside it, kaboom.
- [`19c626d`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/19c626d69888f0cdc6e960254b3fdf523ec4b52c) [#10655](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10655) Get rid of the remove commit phase– we could have it prune _just_ the module being removed, but that isn't gaining us anything. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

After all that, we shouldn't be upgrading the `add` of a bundled package to a `move`. Moves save us from having to extract the package, but with a bundled dependency it's included in another package already so that doesn't gain us anything.

#### THE ONGOING SAGA OF BUNDLED DEPENDENCIES

`npm@3.5.0` fixed up a serious issue with how `npm@3.4.1` (and potentially `npm@3.4.0` and `npm@3.3.12`) handled the case in which dependencies bundled into a package tarball are handled improperly when one or more of their own dependencies are older than what's latest on the registry. Unfortunately, in fixing that (quite severe) regression (see [`npm@3.5.0`'s release notes' for details](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.5.0)), we introduced a new (small, and fortunately cosmetic) issue where npm superfluously warns you about bundled dependencies being stale. We have now fixed that, and hope that we haven't introduced any _other_ regressions in the process. :D

#### TEEN ORCS AT THE GATES

This week heralds the general release of the primary npm registry's [new support for private packages for organizations](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/133542170540/private-packages-for-organizations). For many potential users, it's the missing piece needed to make it easy for you to move your organization's private work onto npm. And now it's here! The functionality to support it has been in place in the CLI for a while now, thanks to [@zkat](https://github.com/zkat)'s hard work.

During our final testing before the release, our ace support team member [@snopeks](https://github.com/snopeks) noticed that there had been some drift between the CLI team's implementation and what npm was actually preparing to ship. In the interests of everyone having a smooth experience with this _extremely useful_ new feature, we quickly made a few changes to square up the CLI and the web site experiences.
- [`d7fb92d`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d7fb92d1c53ba5196ad6dd2101a06792a4c0412b) [#9327](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9327) `npm access` no longer has problems when run in a directory that doesn't contain a `package.json`. ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

#### NON-OPTIONAL INSTALLS, DEFINITELY NON-OPTIONAL
- [`180263b`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/180263b) [#10465](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10465) When a non-optional dep fails, we check to see if it's only required by ONLY optional dependencies. If it is, we make it fail all the deps in that chain (and roll them back). If it isn't then we give an error.
  
  We do this by walking up through all of our ancestors until we either hit an optional dependency or the top of the tree. If we hit the top, we know to give the error.
  
  If you installed a module by hand but didn't `--save` it, your module won't have the top of the tree as an anscestor and so this code was failing to abort the install with an error
  
  This updates the logic so that hitting the top OR a module that was requested by the user will trigger the error message. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
- [`b726a0e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/b726a0e) [#9204](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9204) Ideally we would like warnings about your install to come AFTER the output from your compile steps or the giant tree of installed modules.
  
  To that end, we've moved warnings about failed optional deps to the show after your install completes. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### OVERRIDING BUNDLING
- [`aed71fb`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/aed71fb) [#10482](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10482) We've been in our bundled modules code a lot lately, and our last go at this introduced a new bug, where if you had a module `a` that bundled a module `b`, which in turn required `c`, and the version of `c` that got bundled wasn't compatible with `b`'s `package.json`, we would then install a compatible version of `c`, but also erase `b` at the same time.
  
  This fixes that. It also reworks our bundled module support to be much closer to being in line with how we handle non-bundled modules and we're hopeful this will reduce any future errors around them. The new structure is hopefully much easier to reason about anyway. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### A BRIEF NOTE ON NPM'S BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY

We don't often have much to say about the changes we make to our internal testing and tooling, but I'm going to take this opportunity to reiterate that npm tries hard to maintain compatibility with a wide variety of Node versions. As this change shows, we want to ensure that npm works the same across:
- Node.js 0.8
- Node.js 0.10
- Node.js 0.12
- the latest io.js release
- Node.js 4 LTS
- Node.js 5

Contributors who send us pull requests often notice that it's very rare that our tests pass across all of those versions (ironically, almost entirely due to the packages we use for testing instead of any issues within npm itself). We're currently beginning an effort, lasting the rest of 2015, to clean up our test suite, and not only get it passing on all of the above versions of Node.js, but working solidly on Windows as well. This is a compounding form of technical debt that we're finally paying down, and our hope is that cleaning up the tests will produce a more robust CLI that's a lot easier to write patches for.

#### 0.8 + npm <1.4 COMPATIBLE? SURE WHY NOT

Hey, you found the feature we added!
- [`231c58a`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/231c58a) [#10337](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10337) Add two new flags, first `--legacy-bundling` which installs your dependencies such that if you bundle those dependencies, npm versions prior to `1.4` can still install them. This eliminates all automatic deduping.
  
  Second, `--global-style` which will install modules in your `node_modules` folder with the same layout as global modules. Only your direct dependencies will show in `node_modules` and everything they depend on will be flattened in their `node_modules` folders. This obviously will elminate some deduping.

In a special one-off release as part of the [strategy to get a version of npm into Node LTS that works with the current registry](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/issues/37), modify npm to print out this deprecation banner literally every time npm is invoked to do anything:

```
npm WARN deprecated This version of npm lacks support for important features,
npm WARN deprecated such as scoped packages, offered by the primary npm
npm WARN deprecated registry. Consider upgrading to at least npm@2, if not the
npm WARN deprecated latest stable version. To upgrade to npm@2, run:
npm WARN deprecated
npm WARN deprecated   npm -g install npm@latest-2
npm WARN deprecated
npm WARN deprecated To upgrade to the latest stable version, run:
npm WARN deprecated
npm WARN deprecated   npm -g install npm@latest
npm WARN deprecated
npm WARN deprecated (Depending on how Node.js was installed on your system, you
npm WARN deprecated may need to prefix the preceding commands with `sudo`, or if
npm WARN deprecated on Windows, run them from an Administrator prompt.)
npm WARN deprecated
npm WARN deprecated If you're running the version of npm bundled with
npm WARN deprecated Node.js 0.10 LTS, be aware that the next version of 0.10 LTS
npm WARN deprecated will be bundled with a version of npm@2, which has some small
npm WARN deprecated backwards-incompatible changes made to `npm run-script` and
npm WARN deprecated semver behavior.
```

The message basically tells the tale: Node 0.10 will finally be getting `npm@2`, so those of you who haven't upgraded your build systems to deal with its (relatively small) breaking changes should do so now.

Also, this version doesn't even pretend that it can deal with scoped packages, which, given the confusing behavior of older versions of `npm@1.4`, where it would sometimes try to install packages from GitHub, is a distinct improvement.

There is no good reason for you as an end user to upgrade to this version of npm yourself.

This is a dependency update week, so that means no PRs from our lovely users. Look for those next week. As it happens, the dependencies updated were just devdeps, so nothing for you all to worry about.

But the bug fixes, oh geez, I tracked down some really long standing stuff this week!! The headliner is those intermittent `ENOENT` errors that no one could reproduce consistently? I think they're nailed! But also pretty important, the bug where `hapi` would install w/ a dep missing? Squashed!

#### EEEEEEENOENT
- [`f0e2088`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/f0e2088) [#10026](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10026) Eliminate some, if not many, of the EONENT errors `npm@3` has seen over the past few months. This was happening when npm would, in its own mind, correct a bundled dependency, due to a `package.json` specifying an incompatible version. Then, when npm extracted the bundled version, what was on disk didn't match its mind and… well, when it tried to act on what was in its mind, we got an `ENOENT` because it didn't actually exist on disk. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### PARTIAL SHRINKWRAPS, NO LONGER A BAD DAY
- [`712fd9c`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/712fd9c) [#10153](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/10153) Imagine that you have a module, let's call it `fun-time`, and it depends on two dependencies, `need-fun@1` and `need-time`. Further, `need-time` requires `need-fun@2`. So after install the logical tree will look like this:
  
  ```
  fun-time
  ├── need-fun@1
  └── need-time
      └── need-fun@2
  ```
  
  Now, the `fun-time` author also distributes a shrinkwrap, but it only includes the `need-fun@1` in it.
  
  Resolving dependencies would look something like this:
  1. Require `need-fun@1`: Use version from shrinkwrap (ignoring version)
  2. Require `need-time`: User version in package.json
     1. Require `need-fun@2`: Use version from shrinkwrap, which oh hey, is already installed at the top level, so no further action is needed.
  
  Which results in this tree:
  
  ```
  fun-time
  ├── need-fun@1
  └── need-time
  ```
  
  We're ignoring the version check on things specified in the shrinkwrap so that you can override the version that will be installed. This is because you may want to use a different version than is specified by your dependencies' dependencies' `package.json` files.
  
  To fix this, we now only allow overrides of a dependency version when that dependency is a child (in the tree) of the thing that requires it. This means that when we're looking for `need-fun@2` we'll see `need-fun@1` and reject it because, although it's from a shrinkwrap, it's parent is `fun-time` and the package doing the requiring is `need-time`.

#### STRING `package.bin` AND NON-NPMJS REGISTRIES
- [`3de1463`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3de1463) [#9187](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9187) If you were using a module with the `bin` field in your `package.json` set to a string on a non-npmjs registry then npm would crash, due to the our expectation that the `bin` field would be an object. We now pass all `package.json` data through a routine that normalizes the format, including the `bin` field. (This is the same routine that your `package.json` is passed through when read off of disk or sent to the registry for publication.) Doing this also ensures that older modules on npm's own registry will be treated exactly the same as new ones.

So, as Kat mentioned in last week's 2.x release, we're now swapping weeks between accepting PRs and doing dependency updates, in an effort to keep release management work from taking over our lives. This week is a PR week, so we've got a bunch of goodies for you.

Relatedly, this week means 3.3.6 is now `latest` and it is WAY faster than previous 3.x releases. Give it or this a look!

#### OPTIONAL DEPS, MORE OPTIONAL
- [`2289234`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2289234) [#9643](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9643) [#9664](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9664) `npm@3` was triggering `npm@2`'s build mechanics when it was linking bin files into the tree. This was originally intended to trigger rebuilds of bundled modules, but `npm@3`'s flat module structure confused it. This caused two seemingly unrelated issues. First, failing optional dependencies could under some circumstances (if they were built during this phase) trigger a full build failure. And second, rebuilds were being triggered of already installed modules, again, in some circumstances. Both of these are fixed by disabling the `npm@2` mechanics and adding a special rebuild phase for the initial installation of bundled modules. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### BAD NAME, NO CRASH
- [`b78fec9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/b78fec9) [#9766](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9766) Refactor all attempts to read the module name or package name to go via a single function, with appropriate guards unusual circumstances where they aren't where we expect them.

Hi all, and greetings from [Open Source & Feelings](http://osfeels.com)!

So we're switching gears a little with how we handle our weekly releases: from now on, we're going to stagger release weeks between dependency bumps and regular patches. So, this week, aside from a doc change, we'll be doing only version bumps. Expect actual patches next week!

#### TOTALLY FOLLOWING THE RULES ALREADY

So I snuck this in, because it's our own [@snopeks](https://github.com/snopeks)' first contribution to the main `npm` repo.

I have the most exciting news for you this week. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. Well, ok, maybe you do if you follow my twitter.

Performance just got 5 bazillion times better (under some circumstances, ymmv, etc). So– my test scenario is our very own website. In npm@2, on my macbook running `npm ls` takes about 5 seconds. Personally it's more than I'd like, but it's entire workable. In npm@3 it has been taking _50_ seconds, which is appalling. But after doing some work on Monday isolating the performance issues I've been able to reduce npm@3's run time back down to 5 seconds.

Other scenarios were even worse, there was one that until now in npm@3 that took almost 6 minutes, and has been reduced to 14 seconds.

Still, we've got a couple of really important bug fixes this week. Plus a lil bit from the [now LTS 2.x branch](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.6).

#### ATTENTION WINDOWS USERS

If you previously updated to npm 3 and you try to update again, you may get an error messaging telling you that npm won't install npm into itself. Until you are at 3.3.5 or greater, you can get around this with `npm install -f -g npm`.
- [`bef06f5`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/bef06f5) [#9741](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9741) Uh... so... er... it seems that since npm@3.2.0 on Windows with a default configuration, it's been impossible to update npm. Well, that's not actually true, there's a work around (see above), but it shouldn't be complaining in the first place. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### STACK OVERFLOWS ON PUBLISH
- [`330b496`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/330b496) [#9667](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9667) We were keeping track of metadata about your project while packing the tree in a way that resulted in this data being written to packed tar files headers. When this metadata included cycles, it resulted in the the tar file entering an infinite recursive loop and eventually crashing with a stack overflow.
  
  I've patched this by keeping track of your metadata by closing over the variables in question instead, and I've further restricted gathering and tracking the metadata to times when it's actually needed. (Which is only if you need bundled modules.) ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

This is a relatively quiet release, bringing a few bug fixes and some module updates, plus via the [2.14.5 release](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.5) some forward compatibility fixes with versions of Node that aren't yet released.

#### NO BETA NOTICE THIS TIME!!

But, EXCITING NEWS FRIENDS, this week marks the exit of npm@3 from beta. This means that the week of this release, [v3.3.3](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.3.3) will become `latest` and this version (v3.3.4) will become `next`!!

#### CRUFT FOR THE CRUFT GODS

What I call ""cruft"", by which I mean, files sitting around in your `node_modules` folder, will no longer produce warnings in `npm ls` nor during `npm install`. This brings npm@3's behavior in line with npm@2.

That's right folks. As of this week, `npm@latest` is `npm@3`! There's some really great shiny new things over there, and you should really take a look.

Many kudos to [@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) for her hard work on `npm@3`!

Don't worry, we'll keep `2.x` around for a while (as LTS), but you won't see many, if any, new features on this end. From now on, we're going to use `latest-2` and `next-2` as the dist tags for the `npm@2` branch.

This short week brought us brings us a few small bug fixes, a doc change and a whole lotta dependency updates.

Plus, as usual, this includes a forward port of everything in [`npm@2.14.4`](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.4).

#### BETA BUT NOT FOREVER

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**. `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the community. During that time we will still be doing `npm@2` releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`. We'll _also_ be publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest` alongside those versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`. We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs. It's a significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant bugs remaining. So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production maintenance or frontline continuous deployment just yet.

#### REMOVE INSTALLED BINARIES ON WINDOWS

So waaaay back at the start of August, I fixed a bug with [#9198](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9198). That fix made it so that if you had two modules installed that both installed the same binary (eg `gulp` & `gulp-cli`), that removing one wouldn't remove the binary if it was owned by the other.

It did this by doing some hocus-pocus that, turns out, was Unix-specific, so on Windows it just threw up its hands and stopped removing installed binaries at all. Not great.

So today we're fixing that– it let us maintain the same safety that we added in #9198, but ALSO works with windows.

#### API DOCUMENTATION HAS BEEN SACRIFICED THE API GOD

The documentation of the internal APIs of npm is going away, because it would lead people into thinking they should integrate with npm by using it. Please don't do that! In the future, we'd like to give you a suite of stand alone modules that provide better, more stand alone APIs for your applications to build on. But for now, call the npm binary with `process.exec` or `process.spawn` instead.

#### ALLOW `npm link` ON WINDOWS W/ PRERELEASE VERSIONS OF NODE

We never meant to have this be a restriction in the first place and it was only just discovered with the recent node 4.0.0 release candidate.

#### graceful-fs update

We're updating all of npm's deps to use the most recent `graceful-fs`. This turns out to be important for future not yet released versions of node, because older versions monkey-patch `fs` in ways that will break in the future. Plus it ALSO makes use of `process.binding` which is an internal API that npm definitely shouldn't have been using. We're not done yet, but this is the bulk of them.

So [Node 4 is out now](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v4.0.0/) and that's going to involve a number of things over in npm land. Most importantly, it's the last major release that will include the `2.x` branch of npm. That also means that `2.x` is going to go into LTS mode in the coming weeks -- once `npm@3` becomes our official `latest` release. You can most likely expect Node 5 to include `npm@3` by default, whenever that happens. We'll go into more detail about LTS at that point, as well, so keep your eyes peeled for announcements!

#### NODE IS DEAD. LONG LIVE NODE!

Node 4 being released means that a few things that used to be floating patches are finally making it right into npm proper. This week, we've got two such updates, both to dependencies:

[@thefourtheye](https://github.com/thefourtheye) was kind enough to submit a _bunch_ of PRs to npm's dependencies updating them to `graceful-fs@4.1.2`, which mainly makes it so we're no longer monkey-patching `fs`. The following are all updates related to this:

[@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) is putting out this release (again) as his esteemed colleague [@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) finishes relocating herself, her family, and her sizable anime collection all the way across North America. It contains [all the goodies in `npm@2.14.3`](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.3) and one other dependency update.

#### BETA WARNINGS FOR FUN AND PROFIT

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**. `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the community.  During that time we will still be doing `npm@2` releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`.  We'll _also_ be publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest` alongside those versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`.  We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs.  It's a significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant bugs remaining.  So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production maintenance or frontline continuous deployment just yet.

That said, it's getting there! It will be leaving beta very soon!

So apparently the `preferGlobal` option hasn't quite been warning correctly for some time. But now it should be all better! tl;dr: if you try and install a dependency with `preferGlobal: true`, and it's _not already_ in your `package.json`, you'll get a warning that the author would really rather you install it with `--global`.

1702475,2015-08-21T00:19:36Z,2015-08-21T00:33:33Z,,"#### SECURITY FIX

There are patches for two information leaks of moderate severity in `npm@2.14.1`:
1. In some cases, npm was leaking sensitive credential information into the child environment when running package and lifecycle scripts. This could lead to packages being published with files (most notably `config.gypi`, a file created by `node-gyp` that is a cache of environmental information regenerated on every run) containing the bearer tokens used to authenticate users to the registry. Users with affected packages have been notified (and the affected tokens invalidated), and now npm has been modified to not upload files that could contain this information, as well as scrubbing the sensitive information out of the environment passed to child scripts.
2. Per-package `.npmrc` files are used by some maintainers as a way to scope those packages to a specific registry and its credentials. This is a reasonable use case, but by default `.npmrc` was packed into packages, leaking those credentials.  npm will no longer include `.npmrc` when packing tarballs.

If you maintain packages and believe you may be affected by either of the above scenarios (especially if you've received a security notification from npm recently), please upgrade to `npm@2.14.1` as soon as possible. If you believe you may have inadvertently leaked your credentials, upgrade to `npm@2.14.1` on the affected machine, and run `npm logout` and then `npm login`. Your access tokens will be invalidated, which will eliminate any risk posed by tokens inadvertently included in published packages. We apologize for the inconvenience this causes, as well as the oversight that led to the existence of this issue in the first place.

Huge thanks to [@ChALkeR](https://github.com/ChALkeR) for bringing these issues to our attention, and for helping us identify affected packages and maintainers. Thanks also to the Node.js security working group for their coördination with the team in our response to this issue. We appreciate everybody's patience and understanding tremendously.

This is a pretty EXCITING week. But I may be a little excitable– or possibly sleep deprived, it's sometimes hard to tell them apart. =D So [Kat](https://github.com/zkat) really went the extra mile this week and got the client side support for teams and orgs out in this week's 2.x release. You can't use that just yet, 'cause we have to turn on some server side stuff too, but this way it'll be there for you all the moment we do! Check out the details over in the [2.14.0 release notes](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.0)!

But we over here in 3.x ALSO got a new feature this week, check out the new `--only` and `--also` flags for better control over when dev and production dependencies are used by various npm commands.

That, and some important bug fixes round out this week. Enjoy everyone!

#### NEVER SHALL NOT BETA THE BETA

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**. EXCITING NEW BETA WARNING!!! Ok, I fibbed, EXACTLY THE SAME BETA WARNINGS: `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the community. During that time we will still be doing `npm@2` releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`. We'll _also_ be publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest` alongside those versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`. We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs. It's a significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant bugs remaining. So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production maintenance or frontline continuous deployment just yet.

#### ONLY ALSO DEV

Hey we've got a SUPER cool new feature for you all, thanks to the fantastic work of [@davglass](https://github.com/davglass) and [@bengl](https://github.com/bengl) we have `--only=prod`, `--only=dev`, `--also=prod` and `--also=dev` options. These apply in various ways to: `npm install`, `npm ls`, `npm outdated` and `npm update`.

So for instance:

```
npm install --only=dev
```

Only installs dev dependencies. By contrast:

```
npm install --only=prod
```

Will only install prod dependencies and is very similar to `--production` but differs in that it doesn't set the environment variables that `--production` does.

The related new flag, `--also` is most useful with things like:

```
npm shrinkwrap --also=dev
```

As shrinkwraps don't include dev deps by default. This replaces passing in `--dev` in that scenario.

And that leads into the fact that this deprecates `--dev` as its semantics across commands were inconsistent and confusing.
- [`3ab1eea`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3ab1eea) [#9024](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9024) Add support for `--only`, `--also` and deprecate `--dev` ([@bengl](https://github.com/bengl))

#### DON'T TOUCH! THAT'S NOT YOUR BIN
- [`b31812e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/b31812e) [#8996](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/8996) When removing a module that has bin files, if one that we're going to remove is a symlink to a DIFFERENT module, leave it alone. This only happens when you have two modules that try to provide the same bin. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### THERE'S AN END IN SIGHT
- [`d2178a9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d2178a9) [#9223](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9223) Close a bunch of infinite loops that could show up with symlink cycles in your dependencies. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

This release adds support for teens and orcs (err, teams and organizations) to the npm CLI! Note that the web site and registry-side features of this are still not ready for public consumption.

A beta should be starting in the next couple of weeks, and the features themselves will become public once all that's done. Keep an eye out for more news!

Lot's of lovely bug fixes for `npm@3`.  I'm also suuuuper excited that I think we have a handle on stack explosions that effect a small portion of our users.  We also have some tantalizing clues as to where some low hanging fruit may be for performance issues.

And of course, in addition to the npm@3 specific bug fixes, there are some great one's coming in from npm@2!  [@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) put together that release this week– check out its [release notes](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.13.4) for the deets.

#### AS ALWAYS STILL BETA

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**.  Just like the airline safety announcements, we're not taking this plane off till we finish telling you: `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the community.  During that time we will still be doing `npm@2` releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`.  We'll _also_ be publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest` alongside those versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`.  We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs.  It's a significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant bugs remaining.  So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production maintenance or frontline continuous deployment just yet.

This is another quiet week for the `npm@2` release. [@zkat](https://github.com/zkat) has been working hard on polishing the CLI bits of the registry's new feature to support direct management of teams and organizations, and [@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) continues to work through the list of issues blocking the general release of `npm@3`, which is looking more and more solid all the time.

[@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) and [@zkat](https://github.com/zkat) have also been at this week's Node.js / io.js [collaborator summit](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/tree/master), both as facilitators and participants. This is a valuable opportunity to get some face time with other contributors and to work through a bunch of important discussions, but it does leave us feeling kind of sleepy. Running meetings is hard!

What does that leave for this release? A few of the more tricky bug fixes that have been sitting around for a little while now, and a couple dependency upgrades. Nothing too fancy, but most of these were contributed by developers like _you_, which we think is swell. Thanks!

- [`2fac6ae`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2fac6aeffefba2934c3db395b525d931599c34d8)  [#9012](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9012) A convenience for releases -- using the globally-installed npm before now was causing minor annoyances, so we just use the exact same npm we're releasing to build the new release.

There's a couple of doc updates! The last one might be interesting.

Did you know you don't need to use `--access=public` when publishing scoped packages?! Just put it in your `package.json`! Go refresh yourself on scopes packages by [checking our docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/scoped-packages) on them. ([@boennemann](https://github.com/boennemann))

#### THE SEMVER MAJOR VERSION APOCALYPSE IS UPON US

Basically, `semver` is up to `@5`, and that meant we needed to go in an update a bunch of our dependencies manually. `node-gyp` is still pending update, since it's not ours, though!

Rebecca: So Kat, I hear this week's other release uses a dialog between us to explain what changed?

Kat: Well, you could say that…

Rebecca: I would! This week I fixed more npm@3 bugs!

Kat: That sounds familiar.

Rebecca: Eheheheh, well, before we look at those, a word from our sponsor…

#### BETA IS AS BETA DOES

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**. Yes, we're still reminding you of this. No, you can't be excused. `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the community. During that time we will still be doing `npm@2` releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`. We'll _also_ be publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest` alongside those versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`. We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs. It's a significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant bugs remaining. So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production maintenance or frontline continuous deployment just yet.

#### SO MANY LINKS YOU COULD MAKE A CHAIN

Rebecca: Ok, enough of the dialoguing, that's Kat's schtick. But do remember kids, betas hide in dark hallways waiting to break your stuff, stuff like…
- [`6d69ec9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/6d69ec9) [#8967](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8967) Removing a module linked into your globals would result in having all of its subdeps removed. Since the npm release process does exactly this, it burned me -every- -single- -week-. =D While we're here, we also removed extraneous warns that used to spill out when you'd remove a symlink. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))
- [`fdb360f`](https://github.com/npm/npm/fdb360f) [#8874](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8874) Linking scoped modules was failing outright, but this fixes that and updates our tests so we don't do it again. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### WE'LL TRY NOT TO CRACK YOUR WINDOWS
- [`9fafb18`](https://github.com/npm/npm/9fafb18) [#8701](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8701) npm@3 introduced permissions checks that run before it actually tries to do something. This saves you from having an install fail half way through. We did this using the shiny new `fs.access` function available in `node 0.12` and `io.js`, with fallback options for older nodes. Unfortunately the way we implemented the fallback caused racey problems for Windows systems. This fixes that by ensuring we only ever run any one check on a directory once. BUT it turns out there are bugs in `fs.access` on Windows. So this ALSO just disables the use of `fs.access` on Windows entirely until that settles out. ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### ZOOM ZOOM, DEP UPDATES

Rebecca: And make sure to keep an eye out for patches for the super-fresh `npm@3`!

#### LET'S GIT INKY

Rebecca: So what's this about another git URL issue?

Kat: Welp, I apparently broke backwards-compatibility on what are actually invalid `git+https` URLs! So I'm making it work, but we're gonna deprecate URLs that look like `git+https://user@host:path/is/here`.

So, `v3.1.1` managed to actually break installing local modules. And then immediately after I drove to an island for the weekend. 😁 So let's get this fixed outside the usual release train!

Fortunately it didn't break installing _global_ modules and so you could swap it out for another version at least.

If you do accidentally use the old tag names, I'll be maintaining them for a few releases, but they won't be around forever.

#### YUP STILL BETA, PLEASE PAY ATTENTION

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**. `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the community. During that time we will still be doing `npm@2` releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`. We'll _also_ be publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@v3.x-next` and `npm@v3.x-latest` alongside those versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`. We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs. It's a significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant bugs remaining. So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production maintenance or frontline continuous deployment just yet.

#### BUGS ON THE WINDOWS

#### FORREST IS OUT! LET'S SNEAK IN ALL THE THINGS!

Well, not _everything_. Just a couple of goodies, like the new `npm ping` command, and the ability to add files to the commits created by `npm version` with the new version hooks. There's also a couple of bugfixes in `npm` itself and some of its dependencies. Here we go!

#### YES HELLO THIS IS NPM REGISTRY SORRY NO DOG HERE

Yes, that's right! We now have a dedicated `npm ping` command. It's super simple and super easy. You ping. We tell you whether you pinged right by saying hello right back. This should help out folks dealing with things like proxy issues or other registry-access debugging issues. Give it a shot!

This addresses [#5750](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5750), and will help with the `npm doctor` stuff descripbed in [#6756](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6756).

Seriously! This patch lets you add files to the `version` commit before it's made, So you can add additional metadata files, more automated changes to `package.json`, or even generate `CHANGELOG.md` automatically pre-commit if you're into that sort of thing. I'm so happy this is there I can't even. Do you have other fun usecases for this? Tell [npmbot (@npmjs)](http://twitter.com/npmjs) about it!

I keep [hearing some commotion](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.0.0). Is there something going on? Like, a party or something? Anyway, here's a small release with at least two significant bug fixes, at least one of which some of you have been waiting for for quite a while.

#### REMEMBER WHEN I SAID ""REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THAT THING ABOUT PERMISSIONS?""?

`npm@2.12.0` has a change that introduces a fix for a permissions problem whereby the `_locks` directory in the cache directory can up being owned by root. The fix in 2.12.0 takes care of that problem, but introduces a new problem for Windows users where npm tries to call `process.getuid()`, which doesn't exist on Windows. It was easy enough to fix (but more or less impossible to test, thanks to all the external dependencies involved with permissions and platforms and whatnot), but as a result, Windows users might want to skip `npm@2.12.0` and go straight to `npm@2.12.1`. Sorry about that!
- [`7e5da23`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/7e5da238ee869201fdb9027c27b79b0f76b440a8) When using the new, ""fixed"" cache directory creator, be extra-careful to not call `process.getuid()` on platforms that lack it. ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

#### WHEW! ALL DONE FIXING GIT FOREVER!

New npm CLI team hero [@zkat](https://github.com/zkat) has finally (FINALLY) fixed the regression somebody (hi!) introduced a couple months ago whereby git URLs of the format `git+ssh://user@githost.com:org/repo.git` suddenly stopped working, and also started being saved (and cached) incorrectly. I am 100% sure there are absolutely no more bugs in the git caching code at all ever. Mm hm. Yep. Pretty sure. Maybe. Hmm... I hope.

_Sighs audibly._

Wow, it's finally here! This has been a long time coming. We are all delighted and proud to be getting this out into the world, and are looking forward to working with the npm user community to get it production-ready as quickly as possible.

`npm@3` constitutes a nearly complete rewrite of npm's installer to be easier to maintain, and to bring a bunch of valuable new features and design improvements to you all.

[@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) and [@isaacs](https://github.com/isaacs) have been [talking about the changes](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/91303926460/npm-cli-roadmap-a-periodic-update) in this release for well over a year, and it's been the primary focus of [@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) since she joined the team.

Given that this is a near-total rewrite, all changes listed here are [@iarna](https://github.com/iarna)'s work unless otherwise specified.

#### NO, REALLY, READ THIS PARAGRAPH. IT'S THE IMPORTANT ONE.

**_THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE_**. `npm@3` will remain in beta until we're confident that it's stable and have assessed the effect of the breaking changes on the community. During that time we will still be doing `npm@2` releases, with `npm@2` tagged as `latest` and `next`. We'll _also_ be publishing new releases of `npm@3` as `npm@3.0-next` and `npm@3.0-latest` alongside those versions until we're ready to switch everyone over to `npm@3`. We need your help to find and fix its remaining bugs. It's a significant rewrite, so we are _sure_ there still significant bugs remaining. So do us a solid and deploy it in non-critical CI environments and for day-to-day use, but maybe don't use it for production maintenance or frontline continuous deployment just yet.

#### BREAKING CHANGES

##### `peerDependencies`

`grunt`, `gulp`, and `broccoli` plugin maintainers take note! You will be affected by this change!
- [#6930](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6930) ([#6565](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6565)) `peerDependencies` no longer cause _anything_ to be implicitly installed. Instead, npm will now warn if a packages `peerDependencies` are missing, but it's up to the consumer of the module (i.e. you) to ensure the peers get installed / are included in `package.json` as direct `dependencies` or `devDependencies` of your package.
- [#3803](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3803) npm also no longer checks `peerDependencies` until after it has fully resolved the tree.

This shifts the responsibility for fulfilling peer dependencies from library framework / plugin maintainers to application authors, and is intended to get users out of the dependency hell caused by conflicting `peerDependency` constraints. npm's job is to keep you _out_ of dependency hell, not put you in it.

##### `engineStrict`
- [#6931](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6931) The rarely-used `package.json` option `engineStrict` has been deprecated for several months, producing warnings when it was used. Starting with `npm@3`, the value of the field is ignored, and engine violations will only produce warnings. If you, as a user, want strict `engines` field enforcement, just run `npm config set engine-strict true`.

As with the peer dependencies change, this is about shifting control from module authors to application authors. It turns out `engineStrict` was very difficult to understand even harder to use correctly, and more often than not just made modules using it difficult to deploy.

##### `npm view`
- [`77f1aec`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/77f1aec) With `npm view` (aka `npm info`), always return arrays for versions, maintainers, etc. Previously npm would return a plain value if there was only one, and multiple values if there were more. ([@KenanY](https://github.com/KenanY))

#### KNOWN BUGS

Again, this is a _**BETA RELEASE**_, so not everything is working just yet. Here are the issues that we already know about. If you run into something that isn't on this list, [let us know](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/new)!
- [#8575](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8575) Circular deps will never be removed by the prune-on-uninstall code.
- [#8588](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8588) Local deps where the dep name and the name in the package.json differ don't result in an error.
- [#8637](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8637) Modules can install themselves as direct dependencies. npm@2 declined to do this.
- [#8660](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8660) Dependencies of failed optional dependencies aren't rolled back when the optional dependency is, and then are reported as extraneous thereafter.

#### NEW FEATURES

##### The multi-stage installer!
- [#5919](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5919) Previously the installer had a set of steps it executed for each package and it would immediately start executing them as soon as it decided to act on a package.
  
  But now it executes each of those steps at the same time for all packages, waiting for all of one stage to complete before moving on. This eliminates many race conditions and makes the code easier to reason about.

This fixes, for instance:
- [#6926](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6926) ([#5001](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5001), [#6170](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6170)) `install` and `postinstall` lifecycle scripts now only execute `after` all the module with the script's dependencies are installed.

##### Install: it looks different!

You'll now get a tree much like the one produced by `npm ls` that highlights in orange the packages that were installed. Similarly, any removed packages will have their names prefixed by a `-`.

Also, `npm outdated` used to include the name of the module in the `Location` field:

```
Package                Current  Wanted  Latest  Location
deep-equal             MISSING   1.0.0   1.0.0  deep-equal
glob                     4.5.3   4.5.3  5.0.10  rimraf > glob
```

Now it shows the module that required it as the final point in the `Location` field:

```
Package                Current  Wanted  Latest  Location
deep-equal             MISSING   1.0.0   1.0.0  npm
glob                     4.5.3   4.5.3  5.0.10  npm > rimraf
```

Previously the `Location` field was telling you where the module was on disk. Now it tells you what requires the module. When more than one thing requires the module you'll see it listed once for each thing requiring it.

##### Install: it works different!
- [#6928](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6928) ([#2931](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2931) [#2950](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2950)) `npm install` when you have an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` will ensure you have the modules specified in it are installed in exactly the shape specified no matter what you had when you started.
- [#6913](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6913) ([#1341](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/1341) [#3124](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3124) [#4956](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4956) [#6349](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6349) [#5465](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5465)) `npm install` when some of your dependencies are missing sub-dependencies will result in those sub-dependencies being installed. That is, `npm install` now knows how to fix broken installs, most of the time.
- [#5465](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5465) If you directly `npm install` a module that's already a subdep of something else and your new version is incompatible, it will now install the previous version nested in the things that need it.
- [`a2b50cf`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/a2b50cf) [#5693](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5693) When installing a new module, if it's mentioned in your `npm-shrinkwrap.json` or your `package.json` use the version specifier from there if you didn't specify one yourself.

##### Flat, flat, flat!

Your dependencies will now be installed _maximally flat_. Insofar as is possible, all of your dependencies, and their dependencies, and THEIR dependencies will be installed in your project's `node_modules` folder with no nesting. You'll only see modules nested underneath one another when two (or more) modules have conflicting dependencies.
- [#3697](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3697) This will hopefully eliminate most cases where windows users ended up with paths that were too long for Explorer and other standard tools to deal with.
- [#6912](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6912) ([#4761](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4761) [#4037](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4037)) This also means that your installs will be deduped from the start.
- [#5827](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5827) This deduping even extends to git deps.
- [#6936](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6936) ([#5698](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5698)) Various commands are dedupe aware now.

This has some implications for the behavior of other commands:
- `npm uninstall` removes any dependencies of the module that you specified that aren't required by any other module. Previously, it would only remove those that happened to be installed under it, resulting in left over cruft if you'd ever deduped.
- `npm ls` now shows you your dependency tree organized around what requires what, rather than where those modules are on disk.
- [#6937](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6937) `npm dedupe` now flattens the tree in addition to deduping.

And bundling of dependencies when packing or publishing changes too:
- [#2442](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2442) bundledDependencies no longer requires that you specify deduped sub deps. npm can now see that a dependency is required by something bundled and automaticlaly include it. To put that another way, bundledDependencies should ONLY include things that you included in dependencies, optionalDependencies or devDependencies.
- [#5437](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5437) When bundling a dependency that's both a `devDependency` and the child of a regular `dependency`, npm bundles the child depdency.

As a demonstration of our confidence in our own work, npm's own dependencies are now flattened, deduped, and bundled in the `npm@3` style. This means that `npm@3` can't be packed or published by `npm@2`, which is something to be aware of if you're hacking on npm.

##### Shrinkwraps: they are a-changin'!

First of all, they should be idempotent now ([#5779](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5779)). No more differences because the first time you install (without `npm-shrinkwrap.json`) and the second time (with `npm-shrinkwrap.json`).
- [#6781](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6781) Second, if you save your changes to `package.json` and you have `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, then it will be updated as well. This applies to all of the commands that update your tree:
  - `npm install --save`
  - `npm update --save`
  - `npm dedupe --save` ([#6410](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6410))
  - `npm uninstall --save`
- [#4944](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4944) ([#5161](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5161) [#5448](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5448)) Third, because `node_modules` folders are now deduped and flat, shrinkwrap has to also be smart enough to handle this.

And finally, enjoy this shrinkwrap bug fix:
- [#3675](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3675) When shrinkwrapping a dependency that's both a `devDependency` and the child of a regular `dependency`, npm now correctly includes the child.

##### The Age of Progress (Bars)!
- [#6911](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6911) ([#1257](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/1257) [#5340](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5340) [#6420](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6420)) The spinner is gone (yay? boo? will you miss it?), and in its place npm has _progress bars_, so you actually have some sense of how long installs will take. It's provided in Unicode and non-Unicode variants, and Unicode support is automatically detected from your environment.

#### TINY JEWELS

The bottom is where we usually hide the less interesting bits of each release, but each of these are small but incredibly useful bits of this release, and very much worth checking out:
- [`9ebe312`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/9ebe312) Build system maintainers, rejoice: npm does a better job of cleaning up after itself in your temporary folder.
- [#6942](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6942) Check for permissions issues prior to actually trying to install anything.
- Emit warnings at the end of the installation when possible, so that they'll be on your screen when npm stops.
- [#3505](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3505) `npm --dry-run`: You can now ask that npm only report what it _would have done_ with the new `--dry-run` flag. This can be passed to any of the commands that change your `node_modules` folder: `install`, `uninstall`, `update` and `dedupe`.
- [`81b46fb`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/81b46fb) npm now knows the correct URLs for `npm bugs` and `npm repo` for repositories hosted on Bitbucket and GitLab, just like it does for GitHub (and GitHub support now extends to projects hosted as gists as well as traditional repositories).
- [`5be4008a`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/5be4008a09730cfa3891d9f145e4ec7f2accd144) npm has been cleaned up to pass the [`standard`](http://npm.im/standard) style checker. Forrest and Rebecca both feel this makes it easier to read and understand the code, and should also make it easier for new contributors to put together merge-ready patches.

About [a million people](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+EACCES+_locks) have filed issues related to having a tough time using npm after they've run npm once or twice with sudo. ""Don't worry about it!"" I said. ""We've fixed all those permissions problems ages ago! Use this one weird trick and you'll never have to deal with this again!""

Well, uh, if you run npm with root the first time you run npm on a machine, it turns out that the directory npm uses to store lockfiles ends up being owned by the wrong user (almost always root), and that can, well, it can cause problems sometimes. By which I mean every time you run npm without being root it'll barf with `EACCES` errors. Whoops!

This is an obnoxious regression, and to prevent it from recurring, we've made it so that the cache, cached git remotes, and the lockfile directories are all created and maintained using the same utilty module, which not only creates the relevant paths with the correct permissions, but will fix the permissions on those directories (if it can) when it notices that they're broken. An `npm install` run as root ought to be sufficient to fix things up (and if that
doesn't work, first tell us about it, and then run `sudo chown -R $(whoami) $HOME/.npm`).

Also, I apologize for inadvertently gaslighting any of you by claiming this bug wasn't actually a bug. I do think we've got this permanently dealt with now, but I'll be paying extra-close attention to permissions issues related to the cache for a while.
- [`85d1a53`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/85d1a53d7b5e0fc04823187e522ae3711ede61fa) Set permissions on lock directory to the owner of the process. ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

#### I WENT TO NODECONF AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY SPDX T-SHIRT

That's not literally true. We spent very little time discussing SPDX, [@kemitchell](https://github.com/kemitchell) is a champ, and I had a lot of fun playing drum & bass to a mostly empty Boogie Barn and only ended up with one moderately severe cold for my pains. Another winner of a NodeConf! (I would probably wear a SPDX T-shirt if somebody gave me one, though.)

A bunch of us did have a spirited discussion of the basics of open-source intellectual property, and the convergence of me, [@kemitchell](https://github.com/kemitchell), and [@jandrieu](https://github.com/jandrieu) in one place allowed us to hammmer out a small but significant issue that had been bedeviling early adopters of the new SPDX expression syntax in `package.json` license fields: how to deal with packages that are left without a license on purpose.

Refer to [the docs](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/16a3dd545b10f8a2464e2037506ce39124739b41/doc/files/package.json.md#license) for the specifics, but the short version is that instead of using `LicenseRef-LICENSE` for proprietary licenses, you can now use either `UNLICENSED` if you want to make it clear that you don't _want_ your software to be licensed (and want npm to stop warning you about this), or `SEE LICENSE IN <filename>` if there's a license with custom text you want to use. At some point in the near term, we'll be updating npm to verify that the mentioned file actually exists, but for now you're all on the honor system.

Since running `npm version (major|minor|patch)` is typically the last thing many developers do before publishing their updated packages, it makes sense to add life cycle hooks to run tests or otherwise preflight the package before doing a full publish. Thanks, as always, to the indefatigable [@watilde](https://github.com/watilde) for yet another great usability improvement for npm!

1274453,2015-05-08T11:47:41Z,2015-05-08T11:56:20Z,,"#### THE IMPLICATIONS ARE MORE PROFOUND THAN THEY APPEAR

If you've done much development in The Enterprise®™, you know that keeping track of software licenses is far more important than one might expect / hope / fear. Tracking licenses is a hassle, and while many (if not most) of us have (reluctantly) gotten around to setting a license to use by default with all our new projects (even if it's just WTFPL), that's about as far as most of us think about it. In big enterprise shops, ensuring that projects don't inadvertently use software with unacceptably encumbered licenses is serious business, and developers spend a surprising (and appalling) amount of time ensuring that licensing is covered by writing automated checkers and other license auditing tools.

The Linux Foundation has been working on a machine-parseable syntax for license expressions in the form of [SPDX](https://spdx.org/), an appropriately enterprisey acronym. IP attorney and JavaScript culture hero [Kyle Mitchell](http://kemitchell.com/) has put a considerable amount of effort into bringing SPDX to JavaScript and Node. He's written [`spdx.js`](https://github.com/kemitchell/spdx.js), a JavaScript SPDX expression parser, and has integrated it into npm in a few different ways.

For you as a user of npm, this means:
- npm now has proper support for dual licensing in `package.json`, due to SPDX's compound expression syntax. Run `npm help package.json` for details.
- npm will warn you if the `package.json` for your project is either missing a `""license""` field, or if the value of that field isn't a valid SPDX expression (pro tip: `""BSD""` becomes `""BSD-2-Clause""` in SPDX (unless you really want one of its variants); `""MIT""` and `""ISC""` are fine as-is; the [full list](https://github.com/shinnn/spdx-license-ids/blob/master/spdx-license-ids.json) is its own package).
- `npm init` now demands that you use a valid SPDX expression when using it interactively (pro tip: I mostly use `npm init -y`, having previously run `npm config set init.license=MIT` / `npm config set init.author.email=foo` / `npm config set init.author.name=me`).
- The documentation for `package.json` has been updated to tell you how to use the `""license""` field properly with SPDX.

In general, this shouldn't be a big deal for anybody other than people trying to run their own automated license validators, but in the long run, if everybody switches to this format, many people's lives will be made much simpler. I think this is an important improvement for npm and am very thankful to Kyle for taking the lead on this. Also, even if you think all of this is completely stupid, just [choose a license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License-free_software) anyway. Future you will thank past you someday, unless you are [djb](http://cr.yp.to/), in which case you are djb, and more power to you.

As a corollary to the previous changes, I've put some work into making `npm install` spew out fewer pointless warnings about missing values in transitive dependencies. From now on, npm will only warn you about missing READMEs, license fields, and the like for top-level projects (including packages you directly install into your application, but we may relax that eventually).

Practically _nobody_ liked having those warnings displayed for child dependencies, for the simple reason that there was very little that anybody could _do_ about those warnings, unless they happened to be the maintainers of those dependencies themselves. Since many, many projects don't have SPDX-compliant licenses, the number of warnings reached a level where they ran the risk of turning into a block of visual noise that developers (read: me, and probably you) would ignore forever.

So I fixed it. If you still want to see the messages about child dependencies, they're still there, but have been pushed down a logging level to `info`. You can display them by running `npm install -d` or `npm install --loglevel=info`.

#### DOCUMENTATION FIXES AND TWEAKS

These changes may seem simple and small (except Lin's fix to the package name restrictions, which was more an egregious oversight on our part), but cleaner documentation makes npm significantly more pleasant to use.

[@linclark](https://github.com/linclark) has now fixed that, although we will take with us to our graves the reasons why the maximum package name length is 214 characters (well, OK, it was that that was the longest name in the registry when we decided to put a cap on the name length).

npm has been having an issue with CouchDB's web server since the release of io.js and Node.js 0.12.0 that has consumed a huge amount of my time to little visible effect. Sam Mikes picked up the thread from me, and after a [_lot_ of effort](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7699#issuecomment-93091111) figured out that ultimately there are probably a couple problems with the new HTTP Agent keep-alive handling in new versions of Node. In addition, `npm-registry-client` was gratuitously sending a body along with a GET request which was triggering the bugs. Sam removed about 10 bytes from one file in `npm-registry-client`, and this problem, which has been bugging us for months, completely went away.

In conclusion, Sam Mikes is great, and anybody using a private registry hosted on CouchDB should thank him for his hard work. Also, thanks to the community at large for pitching in on this bug, which has been around for months now.

A [helpful bug report](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7872#issuecomment-91809553) led to another round of changes to [`hosted-git-info`](https://github.com/npm/hosted-git-info/commit/827163c74531b69985d1ede7abced4861e7b0cd4), some additional test-writing, and a bunch of hands-on testing against actual private repositories. While the complexity of npm's git dependency handling is nearly fractal (because npm is very complex, and git is even more complex), it's feeling way more solid than it has for a while. We think this is a substantial improvement over what we had before, so give `npm@2.8.1` a shot if you have particularly complex git use cases and [let us know](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/new) how it goes.

(NOTE: These changes mostly affect cloning and saving references to packages hosted in git repositories, and don't address some known issues with things like lifecycle scripts not being run on npm dependencies. Work continues on other issues that affect parity between git and npm registry packages.)

#### SCOPED DEPENDENCIES AND PEER DEPENDENCIES: NOT QUITE REESE'S

Big thanks to [@ewie](https://github.com/ewie) for identifying an issue with how npm was handling `peerDependencies` that were implicitly installed from the `package.json` files of scoped dependencies. This [will be a moot point](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6565#issuecomment-74971689) with the release of `npm@3`, but until then, it's important that `peerDependency` auto-installation work as expected.

#### MAKING IT EASIER TO WRITE NPM TESTS, VERSION 0.0.1

[@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) and I ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23)) have been discussing a [candidate plan](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/rewriting-npm's-tests:-a-plan-maybe) for improving npm's test suite, with the goal of making it easier for new contributors to get involved with npm by reducing the learning curve necessary to be able to write good tests for proposed changes. This is the first substantial piece of that effort. Here's what the commit message for [`ed7e249`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/ed7e249d50444312cd266942ce3b89e1ca049bdf) had to say about this work:

> It's too difficult for npm contributors to figure out what the conventional
> style is for tests. Part of the problem is that the documentation in
> CONTRIBUTING.md is inadequate, but another important factor is that the tests
> themselves are written in a variety of styles.  One of the most notable
> examples of this is the fact that many tests use fixture directories to store
> precooked test scenarios and package.json files.
> 
> This had some negative consequences:
> - tests weren't idempotent
> - subtle dependencies between tests existed
> - new tests get written in this deprecated style because it's not
>   obvious that the style is out of favor
> - it's hard to figure out why a lot of those directories existed,
>   because they served a variety of purposes, so it was difficult to
>   tell when it was safe to remove them
> 
> All in all, the fixture directories were a major source of technical debt, and
> cleaning them up, while time-consuming, makes the whole test suite much more
> approachable, and makes it more likely that new tests written by outside
> contributors will follow a conventional style. To support that, all of the
> tests touched by this changed were cleaned up to pass the `standard` style
> checker.

And here's a little extra context from a comment I left on [#7929](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7929):

> One of the other things that encouraged me was looking at this
> [presentation on technical debt](http://www.slideshare.net/nnja/pycon-2015-technical-debt-the-monster-in-your-closet)
> from Pycon 2015, especially slide 53, which I interpreted in terms of
> difficulty getting new contributors to submit patches to an OSS project like
> npm. npm has a long ways to go, but I feel good about this change.

1149377,2015-04-10T12:29:37Z,2015-04-13T02:36:51Z,,"#### WE WILL NEVER BE DONE FIXING NPM'S GIT SUPPORT

If you look at [the last release's release notes](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#git-mean-git-tuff-git-all-the-way-away-from-my-stuff), you will note that they confidently assert that it's perfectly OK to force all GitHub URLs through the same `git:` -> `git+ssh:` fallback flow for cloning. It turns out that many users depend on `git+https:` URLs in their build environments because they use GitHub auth tokens instead of SSH keys. Also, in some cases you just want to be able to explicitly say how a given dependency should be cloned from GitHub.

Because of the way we resolved the inconsistency in GitHub shorthand handling [before](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bug-fixes-1), this turned out to be difficult to work around. So instead of hacking around it, we completely redid how git is handled within npm and its attendant packages. Again. This time, we changed things so that `normalize-package-data` and `read-package-json` leave more of the git logic to npm itself, which makes handling shorthand syntax consistently much easier, and also allows users to resume using explicit, fully-qualified git URLs without npm messing with them.

Here's a summary of what's changed:
- Instead of converting the GitHub shorthand syntax to a `git+ssh:`, `git:`, or
  `git+https:` URL and saving that, save the shorthand itself to
  `package.json`.
- If presented with shortcuts, try cloning via the git protocol, SSH, and HTTPS
  (in that order).
- No longer prompt for credentials -- it didn't work right with the spinner,
  and wasn't guaranteed to work anyway. We may experiment with doing this a
  better way in the future. Users can override this by setting `GIT_ASKPASS` in
  their environment if they want to experiment with interactive cloning, but
  should also set `--no-spin` on the npm command line (or run `npm config set
  spin=false`).
- **EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE**: Add support for `github:`, `gist:`, `bitbucket:`,
  and `gitlab:` shorthand prefixes. GitHub shortcuts will continue to be
  normalized to `org/repo` instead of being saved as `github:org/repo`, but
  `gitlab:`, `gist:`, and `bitbucket:` prefixes will be used on the command
  line and from `package.json`. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS. `package.json` files
  published with the new shorthand syntax can _only_ be read by `npm@2.8.0` and
  later, and this feature is mostly meant for playing around with it. If you
  want to save git dependencies in a form that older versions of npm can read,
  use `--save-exact`, which will save the git URL and resolved commit hash of
  the head of the branch in a manner simiilar to the way that `--save-exact`
  pins versions for registry dependencies.  This is documented (so check `npm
  help install` for details), but we're not going to make a lot of noise about
  it until it has a chance to bake in a little more.

It is [@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23)'s sincere hope that this will resolve all of the inconsistencies users were seeing with GitHub and git-hosted packages, but given the level of change here, that may just be a fond wish. Extra testing of this release is requested.

Part of the reason that we're reluctant to take patches to how npm deals with git dependencies is that every time we touch the git support, something breaks. The last few releases are a case in point. `npm@2.7.4` completely broke installing private modules from GitHub, and `npm@2.7.5` fixed them at the cost of logging a misleading error message that caused many people to believe that their dependencies hadn't been successfully installed when they actually had been.

This all started from a desire to ensure that GitHub shortcut syntax is being handled correctly.  The correct behavior is for npm to try to clone all dependencies on GitHub (whether they're specified with the GitHub `organization/repository` shortcut syntax or not) via the plain `git:` protocol first, and to fall back to using `git+ssh:` if `git:` doesn't work. Previously, sometimes npm would use `git:` and `git+ssh:` in some cases (most notably when using GitHub shortcut syntax on the command line), and use `git+https:` in others (when the GitHub shortcut syntax was present in `package.json`). This led to subtle and hard-to-understand inconsistencies, and we're glad that as of `npm@2.7.6`, we've finally gotten things to where they were before we started, only slightly more consistent overall.

We are now going to go back to our policy of being extremely reluctant to touch the code that handles Git dependencies.

For a very long time (maybe forever?), the documentation for `npm run-script` has said that `npm restart` will only call `npm stop` and `npm start` when there is no command defined as `npm restart` in `package.json`. The problem with this documentation is that `npm run-script` was apparently never wired up to actually work this way.

Until now.

If the patch below were landed on its own, free of context, it would be a breaking change. But, since the ""new"" behavior is how the documentation claims this feature has always worked, I'm classifying it as a patch-level bug fix. I apologize in advance if this breaks anybody's deployment scripts, and if it turns out to be a significant regression in practice, we can revert this change and move it to `npm@3`, which is allowed to make breaking changes due to being a new major version of semver.

NOTE: This week's registry-2 commands are leading the implementation on
registry.npmjs.org a little bit, so some of the following may not work for
another week or so. Also note that `npm access` has documentation and
subcommands that are not yet finished, because they depend on incompletely
specified registry API endpoints. Things are coming together very quickly,
though, so expect the missing pieces to be filled in the coming weeks.

You can see the in-depth reasoning in d8c907edc2019b75cff0f53467e34e0ffd7e5fba; the problem was, that the patch changed the behavior of `npm install -f` to reinstall all dependencies.

Additional progress on reducing the resulting Git-related I/O is tracked as #4191, but for now, this will be a big improvement.

Added a `--json` mode to `npm outdated` to give a parseable output. (0b6c9b7c8c5579f4d7d37a0c24d9b7a12ccbe5fe, @yyx990803)

Made `npm outdated` much prettier and more useful. It now outputs a color-coded and easy-to-read table. (fd3017fc3e9d42acf6394a5285122edb4dc16106, @quimcalpe)

Added the `--depth` option to `npm outdated`, so that e.g. you can do `npm outdated --depth=0` to show only top-level outdated dependencies. (1d184ef3f4b4bc309d38e9128732e3e6fb46d49c, @yyx990803)

Added a `--no-git-tag-version` option to `npm version`, for doing the usual job of `npm version` minus the Git tagging. This could be useful if you need to increase the version in other related files before actually adding the tag. (59ca9841ba4f4b2f11b8e72533f385c77ae9f8bd, @evanlucas)

Made `npm repo` and `npm docs` work without any arguments, adding them to the list of npm commands that work on the package in the current directory when invoked without arguments.

Pass through the `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY` environment variable to Git, if it is set; we currently do this with a few other environment variables, but we missed that one. (c625de91770df24c189c77d2e4bc821f2265efa8, @arikon)

Fixed `npm dedupe` on Windows due to incorrect path separators being used (7677de4583100bc39407093ecc6bc13715bf8161, @mcolyer).

Fixed the `npm help` command when multiple words were searched for; it previously gave a `ReferenceError`. (6a28dd147c6957a93db12b1081c6e0da44fe5e3c, @dereckson)
