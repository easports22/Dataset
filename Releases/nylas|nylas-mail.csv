Nylas Mail was [officially sunset in August](https://www.nylas.com/blog/sunsetting-nylas-mail-development) and re-licensed under MIT. Nylas is no longer maintaining Nylas Mail, and 2.0.31 is the last public release. For a maintained version of the app, consider checking out one of it's successors:

- **[Mailspring](https://getmailspring.com/)**: One of the original developers is continuing Nylas Mail as [Mailspring](https://getmailspring.com/). Mailspring includes the same Pro features and a new C++ sync engine built on Mailcore2, which is faster, uses less RAM, and fixes many provider-related bugs.

- **[Nylas Mail Lives](https://github.com/nylas-mail-lives/nylas-mail)**: A group of community members forked Nylas Mail to keep it alive, accept contributions from the community and publish new releases that fix bugs and add features.

- Features:
  - Tutorial: We've added helpful overlay tips that guide you through some of
    N1's features.
  - Thread sharing: You can now create a link to any thread and share it on the
    web publicly! You'll see a new button to enable sharing in the top toolbar.
  - Inline images: You can now add inline images to your messages! Just
    drag and drop or paste them anywhere in the composer.
  - Channels: A new option in Preferences > General allows you to join our public
    `beta` channel and receive pre-release versions of N1.
  - Messages: Participants inside a message now have a right-click context menu
    to copy the email address or send an email to the participant.
- Fixes:
  - Search now correctly displays results returned from your email provider (#750).
  - Local / offline search now matches subject lines more loosely.
  - Mail Merge now correctly handles empty column names.
  - Mail Merge is now limited to 150 recipients, since 500 recipients caused many
    accounts to be rate-limited. We will be adding more batch-sending options in the future.

  - Participants inside a message are no longer mailto: links.
  - When linking Fastmail accounts, N1 autofills the correct IMAP and SMTP settings.

    better in many scenarios. We've also upgraded to React 15.3.
  - `N1.sh` now supports working copy paths that contain spaces.
  - SQL queries are now correctly escaped and logged to the console.
  - `Utils.deepClone` now correctly clones Dates.

    In order to facilitate transformations on the draft body, these new extension
    APIs receive a DOM tree of the draft body so no HTML string manipulation is necessary.
  - Backoff timer for streaming connections now has ""jitter"", which should help
    us avoid the thundering herd problem if we have some kind of API outage
    affecting a wide number of clients.

  - Keymaps and menus in packages must now be in `JSON` format rather than `CSON`
  - The `KeymapManager` and `MenuManager` have been re-written to remove unwanted
    features and weight we inherited from Atom and improve compatibility with our
    React-based stack. CSS selectors are no longer used to scope anything.
  - Menus are now specified using Mousetrap syntax. `CmdOrCtrl-A` => `mod+shift+a`
  - This update transitions `config.cson` to `config.json`. We will be removing
    `CSON` support in an upcoming release.

- Features:
  - Snooze: Schedules threads to return to your inbox in a few hours, a few days,
    or whenever you choose.

    Swiping works with the Mac trackpad and with Windows / Linux touchscreen devices.

    These scheduled drafts are sent via the sync engine, so you don’t need to be online.
  - Read Receipts and Link Tracking: Get notified when recipients view your message
    and click links with new read receipts and link tracking built in to the composer.
  - Emoji Picker: Type a `:` in the composer followed by the name of an emoji to
    insert it into your draft.
- Design:
  - This release includes slimmer toolbars and new icons in the composer.
  - Font sizes throughout the app have been made slightly smaller to match platform
    conventions. Like it the old way? Use the zoom feature in Workspace preferences!
  - The N1 icon is now more of a ""sea foam"" green, which helps it stand out among
    standard system icons, and features a square design on Windows.
  - Tons and tons of additional polish.
- Developer:
  - A new `MetadataStore` and `model.pluginMetadata` concept allows plugins to associate
    arbitrary data with threads and messages (like snooze times and link IDs).

since the initial release in October!

#### Features:
- **Unified Inbox**: The conversation view has been rebuilt so you can read and
  triage mail from all your accounts at once. In addition to the Inbox, we've
  unified Search, Drafts, Sent, Trash, and more.
- **Send and Archive**: You can now choose Send and Archive when replying to threads.
  More ""Send variants"" are coming soon, including Send Later and Undo Send, and
  you can choose a default in Preferences.
- **Account Sidebar**: We've rebuilt the account sidebar to address your feedback:
  - Rename folders and labels by right clicking / double clicking
  - Re-order accounts from Preferences > Accounts
  - See unread counts for all accounts when viewing ""All Accounts""
  - Collapse label and folder views
- **Send As**: You can now choose which account or alias a new draft should be sent
  from, and choose a default account in Preferences > Sending.
- **Launch On System Start**: N1 can now launch in the background via an option in Preferences.
- **Search**: You can now archive / trash items in the search results view.
- **Outbox**: N1 now keeps mail it isn't able to send in your Drafts folder, and
  sends when you reconnect to the internet.

#### Performance:
- The conversation list has been rebuilt using a brand new ""live query""
  API that yields great performance and minimizes costly database queries.
- The conversation list data source no longer requires an accurate item count,
  removing frequent and expensive count queries.

#### Development:
- `AccountStore.current()` has been deprecated and replaced with the concept of
  ""Mailbox Perspectives"" which are views of mail data.
- Developer > Toggle Screenshot Mode now allows you to hide text in the app to
  take a screenshot.
- `window.eval` has been disabled in N1. (Issue #1159)

#### Fixes:
- On Mac OS X, N1 no longer crashes when you change language or spellcheck preferences.
- Contact autocompletion is now unified, uses dramatically less memory, and does
  not depend on the selected account
- When viewing all accounts, the tray icon and dock icon also display
  the unified unread count.
- You can now make N1 the default mail client on Windows.
- You can now re-order mail rules and use ""starred"" as a rule criteria.
- You can now authenticate IMAP / SMTP accounts where the username is not the
  email address. (Fixed in the Nylas Sync Engine.)
- The maximum width of the account list has been increased.
- And many, many, many other fixes!

#### Coming Soon:
- Our PR has landed in Electron, unblocking Swipe to Archive.
