Okay, so here it is. FoundationPress is now based on [Foundation 6.4.1](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/releases/tag/v6.4.1). That means we've got a new (and better way) for writing and using layouts with XY-Grid. The old float based grid is disabled by default, but is still a part of the project if you need to support legacy browsers. JavaScript is now bundled and loaded with webpack. And a lot of issues are addressed. I think that it has generally become a better and more robust theme.

We have removed some dependencies like bower. As a consequence of the changes that was introduced in Foundation 6.4.1, the Gulpfile is also changed. This is more or less copied from the [Zurb Template](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template), with only a few adjustments to make it work in a WordPress context.

Last but now least, the [README](https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress/blob/master/README.md
) file is obviously updated with the new instructions.

Enjoy!  🚀

Since then, 46 contributors have helped to drive the project forward.  135 pull requests and 425 commits have been merged so far. Until this moment, the version number of FoundationPress has been in sync with the Zurb Foundation's release cycle. There are several reasons why this is an obstacle to further development of this project. We therefore introduce semantic versioning. All future changes will be tagged and accounted for in a change log. Hopefully this will give a better overview of the progress and status of the project. Kudos to @KLVTZ  for sharing insights around the project versioning. And a special thanks to everyone who helps in resolving issues and suggest improvements.
