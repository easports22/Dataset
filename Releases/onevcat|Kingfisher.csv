Kingfisher 2.6.x is still supporting both Swift 2.2 and 2.3.
- Image Processor. Now you can specify an image processor and it will be used to process images after downloaded. It is useful when you need to apply some transforming or filter to the image. You can also use the processor to support any other image format, like WebP. See [Processor](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/wiki/Cheat-Sheet#processor) section in the wiki for more.

- Now Kingfisher cache will store re-encoded image data instead of the original data by default. This is needed due to we want to store the processed data from `ImageProcessor`. If this is not what you want, you should supply your customized instanse of `CacheSerializer`.

#### Remove
- KingfisherManager.init is removed since you should never create your own manager.
- cachedImageExistsforURL in `ImageCache` is removed since it introduced unnecessary coupling. Use `isImageCached` instead.
- requestModifier`is removed. Use`.requestModifier`and pass a`ImageDownloadRequestModifier`.

#### Fix
- Resource is now a protocol instead of a struct. Use `ImageResource` for your original `Resource` type. And now `URL` conforms `Resource` so the APIs could be clearer.
- Now Kingfisher cache will store re-encoded image data instead of the original data by default. This is needed due to we want to store the processed data from `ImageProcessor`. If this is not what you want, you should supply your customized instanse of `CacheSerializer`.
