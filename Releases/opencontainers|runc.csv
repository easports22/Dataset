7334320,2017-08-09T12:41:28Z,2017-08-10T14:33:31Z,runc 1.0 Release Candidate 4,"## Features:

+ runc now supports v1.0.0 of the OCI runtime specification. #1527
+ Rootless containers support has been released. The current state of
  this feature is that it only supports single-{uid,gid} mappings as an
  unprivileged user, and cgroups are completely unsupported. Work is
  being done to improve this. #774
+ Rather than relying on CRIU version nnumbers, actually check if the
  system supports pre-dumping. #1371
+ Allow the PIDs cgroup limit to be updated. #1423
+ Add support for checkpoint/restore of containers with orphaned PTYs
  (which is effectively all containers with terminal=true). #1355
+ Permit prestart hooks to modify the cgroup configuration of a
  container. #1239
+ Add support for a wide variety of mount options. #1460
+ Expose memory.use_hierarchy in MemoryStats. #1378

## Fixes:

* Fix incorrect handling of systems without the freezer cgroup. #1387
* Many, many changes to switch away from Go's ""syscall"" stdlib to
  ""golang.org/x/sys/unix"". #1394 #1398 #1442 #1464 #1467 #1470 #1474
  #1478 #1491 #1482 #1504 #1519 #1530
* Set cgroup resources when restoring a container. #1399
* Switch back to using /sbin as the installation directory. #1406
* Remove the arbitrary container ID length restriction. #1435
* Make container force deletion ignore non-existent containers. #1451
* Improve handling of arbitrary cgroup mount locations when populating
  cpuset. #1372
* Make the SaneTerminal interface public. #1479
* Fix cases where runc would report a container to be in a ""Running""
  state if the init was a zombie or dead. #1489
* Do not set supplementary groups for numeric users. #1450
* Fix various issues with the ""owner"" field in runc-list. #1516
* Many other miscellaneous fixes, some of which were made by first-time
  contributors. Thanks, and welcome to the project! #1406 #1400 #1365
  #1396 #1402 #1414 #1412 #1408 #1418 #1425 #1428 #1436 #1433 #1438
  #1410 #1447 #1388 #1484 #1481 #1496 #1245 #1524 #1534 #1526 #1533

## Removals:

- Remove any semblance of non-Linux support. #1502
- We no longer use shfmt for testing. #1510

+ Add slice management support to the systemd cgroup driver. Checks are
  done to make sure that systemd supports the feature. #1084
+ Support for readonly mount labels. #1112
+ Add a tmpcopyup mount extension for tmpfs mounts that are mounted over
  already existing directories, allowing for the contents of a volume to
  be copied up transparently. #845

  directories, improving the state of containters running in entirely
  readonly contexts. #1125 #1148
+ Allow updating of rt_period_us and rt_runtime_us in cpuacct cgroup.
+ Reimplement console handling to use AF_UNIX sockets such that the
  console is created inside the container's (namespaced) devpts
  instance, solving a wide variety of historical pty bugs with runC.

4279628,2016-10-01T08:26:01Z,2016-10-01T08:34:55Z,runC 1.0 Release Candidate 2,"### Features
- {create,run}: add --no-new-keyring flag so that a new session keyring
  is not created for the container and the calling process's keyring is
  inherited.
- restore: add --empty-ns flag to tell CRIU to only create a network
  namespace for a container and not populate it (allowing higher levels
  to correctly handle re-creating the network namespace).
- {create,start}: use a FIFO rather than signals to signal the starting
  of a container. This removes the Go version restriction, and also
  avoids potential issues with Go's signal handling.
- exec: allow additional groups to be overridden.
- delete: add --force flag.
- exec: disable the subreaper option entirely, because the option
  causes many issues with reparenting in the context of containers.
  This is not a complete fix, which is intended to land for -rc3. Using
  the removed option will be silently ignored by runC.
- {create,run}: add support for masking directories with MaskPaths.
- delete: allow for the deletion of multiple containers in one cmdline.
- build: add `make release` for distributions.

### Fixes
- Major improvements and fixes to CLI handling. Now commands like
  `runc ps` and `runc exec` will act sanely when you're trying to use
  flags that are not meant to be parsed by runC.
- Set the cp.rt_\* cgroup options correctly so that runC running in
  SCHED_RR (realtime) mode can operate properly.
- Massive improvements to kmem limit detection to ensure that we only
  attempt to change memory.kmem.\* if it is safe to do so.
- Part of a major cleanup of the nsenter code, with more intended to
  land before -rc3.
- Restored containers now have a start time, which is the time that the
  new container was started (not when the original container was
  started).
- Fix the default cgroupPath behaviour, so that we actually attach to
  subcgroups of all of the caller's current cgroups (rather than using
  the devices cgroup path for all other cgroups)
- Support 32bit UIDs on i386 with the setuid32(2) syscall.
- Add /proc/timer_list to the set of default masked paths.
- Do not create /dev/fuse by default.
- Parse cgroupPath correctly if it contains ':'.
- Add some more debugging information for the test suite, along with
  fixes for race conditions and other issues. In addition, add more
  integration tests for edge conditions.
- Improve check-config.sh script to handle more cases.
- Fix incorrect type when setting of net_cls classid.
- Lots of fixes to help pages and man pages.
- *: append -dirty to the version if the git repo is unclean.
- Fix the JSON tags for CpuRt\* options.
- Cleanups to the rootfs setup code.
- Improve error messages related to SELinux.

3371902,2016-06-03T22:25:47Z,2016-06-03T23:08:55Z,runc 1.0 Release Candidate 1,"# runc 1.0 Release Candidate 1

This is the first of the release candidates for OCI's runtime specification and runc version 1.0.  Runc is now using the [runtime-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/tree/v1.0.0-rc1) 1.0.0-rc1 release.  

### Breaking Changes

The large breaking change from the previous versions of runc to 1.0 is the create and start command changes.  The previous start command functionality has been moved to the run command.  `runc run mycontainer`.  `runc start` does not perform the operations that it did before this release.

#### Create -> Start -> Delete

By splitting the create and start phase for a container it allows higher level systems to modify the container before the user defined process is started.

A simple example of using this new workflow would look something like this from the command line:

``` bash
# create the container with the specified configuration 
runc create mycontainer

# at the point that create returns the container's environment is fully setup but the user's specified process has not run

# you can place network interfaces inside the container 
# you can exec into the container
# you can modify the mount namespaces
runc exec mycontainer ps aux

# after your setup is complete you can start the user defined process
runc start mycontainer

# after start returns the user defied process inside your OCI config is running

# whenever the container exits you must delete the container removing any existing resources it still has
runc delete mycontainer
```

If you want the previous functionality where runc did this for you, use the `runc run` command.

#### Container State

You can get the container state and status by using the `runc state` command:

`runc state mycontainer`

``` json
{
  ""ociVersion"": ""1.0.0-rc1"",
  ""id"": ""mycontainer"",
  ""pid"": 18917,
  ""bundlePath"": ""/containers/mycontainer"",
  ""rootfsPath"": ""/containers/mycontainer/rootfs"",
  ""status"": ""running"",
  ""created"": ""2016-06-03T21:23:42.401668933Z"",
  ""annotations"": {
    ""something"": ""else""
  }
}
```

#### ps command

A `ps` command was added to show the processes inside the container:

``` bash
runc ps influxdb
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
1000  18936 18917  0 14:23 ?        00:00:06 influxd -config /home/influxdb/influxdb.conf
```

#### Other Updates
- Added seccomp support for more architectures 
- Stable stats output 
- Added `update` command for dynamically updating container resources
- bash completion and man pages

Please help in testing and please report any issues to the issue tracker on github.  Thanks!
- OCI Maintainers 

### Usage

``` bash
NAME:
   runc - Open Container Initiative runtime

runc is a command line client for running applications packaged according to
the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format and is a compliant implementation of the
Open Container Initiative specification.

runc integrates well with existing process supervisors to provide a production
container runtime environment for applications. It can be used with your
existing process monitoring tools and the container will be spawned as a
direct child of the process supervisor.

Containers are configured using bundles. A bundle for a container is a directory
that includes a specification file named ""config.json"" and a root filesystem.
The root filesystem contains the contents of the container.

To start a new instance of a container:

    # runc start [ -b bundle ] <container-id>

Where ""<container-id>"" is your name for the instance of the container that you
are starting. The name you provide for the container instance must be unique on
your host. Providing the bundle directory using ""-b"" is optional. The default
value for ""bundle"" is the current directory.

USAGE:
   runc [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   1.0.0-rc1
commit: 04f275d4601ca7e5ff9460cec7f65e8dd15443ec

Be sure to update your `config.json` files for these changes or they will not be applied to the container.  You can always use the `runc spec` command to generate a compatible `config.json` based on the specification version that runc is currently using.  

### Updates:
- In this release runc has better support for errors and logging for use with the `--log` flag.  
- Improved namespace sharing for joining PID namespaces.
- Allow all mount types inside the container's mount namespace.
- Updated masked and readonly paths for container's /proc.
- Better IO handling for container's STDIO.
- Unique session keyring support for containers.
- Container label support.
- No new privileges support.
- Various bug fixes and performance improvements.

NAME:
   runc - Open Container Initiative runtime

runc is a command line client for running applications packaged according to
the Open Container Format (OCF) and is a compliant implementation of the
Open Container Initiative specification.

runc integrates well with existing process supervisors to provide a production
container runtime environment for applications. It can be used with your
existing process monitoring tools and the container will be spawned as a
direct child of the process supervisor.

Containers are configured using bundles. A bundle for a container is a directory
that includes a specification file named ""config.json"" and a root filesystem.
The root filesystem contains the contents of the container. 

To start a new instance of a container:

    # runc start [ -b bundle ] <container-id>

Where ""<container-id>"" is your name for the instance of the container that you
are starting. The name you provide for the container instance must be unique on
your host. Providing the bundle directory using ""-b"" is optional. The default
value for ""bundle"" is the current directory.

USAGE:
   runc [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   0.0.9
spec version 0.4.0

COMMANDS:
   checkpoint   checkpoint a running container
   delete   delete any resources held by the container often used with detached containers
   events   display container events such as OOM notifications, cpu, memory, IO and network stats
   exec     execute new process inside the container
   init     init is used to initialize the containers namespaces and launch the users process.
    This command should not be called outside of runc.

   kill     kill sends the specified signal (default: SIGTERM) to the container's init process
   list     lists containers started by runc with the given root
   pause    pause suspends all processes inside the container
   restore  restore a container from a previous checkpoint
   resume   resumes all processes that have been previously paused
   spec     create a new specification file
   start    create and run a container
   state    output the state of a container
   help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --debug      enable debug output for logging
   --log ""/dev/null""    set the log file path where internal debug information is written
   --log-format ""text""  set the format used by logs ('text' (default), or 'json')
   --root ""/run/runc""   root directory for storage of container state (this should be located in tmpfs)
   --criu ""criu""    path to the criu binary used for checkpoint and restore
   --help, -h       show help
   --version, -v    print the version

2590473,2016-02-10T22:11:47Z,2016-02-10T22:31:14Z,Release 0.0.8 for runc and specification 0.3.0,"# runc 0.0.8

This new release of runc supports the OCI runtime specification version 0.3.0.  It includes changes such as the unified configuration file, separation of device creation and access, and many other usability updates.  

## New features

### Detach

The detach flag allows runc to exit after it spawns the container and reparents the process to system init.  You no longer have a long running runc process as the parent of the container.

``` bash
runc start -d test
```

### Pid file

The `pid-file` flag allows runc to write the pid of the process run inside the container to a file so that existing init systems can wait on it and allows runc to exit.

``` bash
runc start -d --pid-file test.pid test
```

### Delete command

The delete command allows runc to delete the container's state after it has exited for use with the detach flag.

``` bash
runc delete test
```

### List command

The list command will list all containers running on a system that were spawned by runc.

``` bash
> runc list
ID          PID         STATUS      CREATED
test        15278       running     2016-02-10T22:21:09.415768192Z
```

### Exec command updates

The exec command now allows you to use a json file for the process configuration or pass the arguments and settings via flags and args.

``` bash
> runc exec --tty --env TEST=1 -- test ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.0   4476   900 ?        Ss+  22:23   0:00 sh
root        13  0.0  0.0  15600  2116 ?        Rs+  22:23   0:00 ps aux
```

### Container ids

Container ids are required for every command in runc.  You pass the container id as argument 1 to the commands to specify which container you want to interact with.  This was always the case before in runc but hidden behind a `--id` flag.  

``` bash
> runc start test
> runc events test
> runc kill test
```

## Update to spec 0.3.0

Be sure to use the `runc spec` command to generate a new base template for your containers based on the specification and the unified configuration file.

After creating config files for your root filesystem with runc, you can execute 
a container in your shell by running:

    # cd /mycontainer
    # runc start [ -b bundle ] <container-id>

If not specified, the default value for the 'bundle' is the current directory.
'Bundle' is the directory where 'config.json' must be located.
