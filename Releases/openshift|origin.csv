## API Changes

- Upgraded to Kubernetes 1.7 [\#15234](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15234)
  - Please see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v170) for a description of important API changes
- Improved documentation of the `Route` backend `weight` field [\#15309](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15309)
- `/oapi/v1/namenspaces/{namespace}/generatedeploymentconfigs` has been removed [\#15585](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15585)

- Improve documentation of the `SecurityContextConstraint` `priority` field [\#15425](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15425)
- `SubjectAccessReview` and `ResourceAccessReview` were marked as namespace-scoped incorrectly in the new API groups [\#15704](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15704)
- Template instantiation will now wait for the object to be ready if it has the `template.alpha.openshift.io/wait-for-ready` annotation set to `true` [\#15402](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15402)
- OpenShift RBAC API objects are now backed by Kubernetes RBAC [\#15021](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15021)
  - The existing OpenShift RBAC APIs will remain, but are implemented on top of Kubernetes RBAC APIs
  - New code should use the Kubernetes RBAC APIs in preference
- The default value of `DeploymentConfig` `spec.revisionHistoryLimit` in apps/v1 is now 10 [\#15642](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15642)
- The `spec.requester` field on `TemplateInstance` now is consistent with other API fields that convey user information [\#15719](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15719)
- The `status.publicDockerImageRepository` field on `ImageStream` reports a pull spec that can be used outside of the cluster to access images [\#15643](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15643)

The [API documentation in `api`](https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/api/docs) is now auto-generated from our public OpenAPI spec and contains more information on individual objects, which is reflected in the [OpenShift API documentation](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/rest_api/index.html) [\#15788](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15788).

### Features

#### Record the last snippet of build logs into the build API result

In many cases, the last few lines of the build log contain an accurate reason for a failing build. This adds a new field `logSnippet` to the build status and populates it with the last few lines of build logs when the build is marked as failed. This field is purely informational and may not be a complete representation of the final logs.

- Grab a snippet of build logs for failing builds [\#15181](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15181)

## Backwards Compatibility

- Security Context Constraints migrated from older versions of OpenShift that have a null allowed `volumes` array will now default to `[""none""]`
  - This will prevent future migration to PodSecurityPolicy from being ambiguous 
  - [\#14625](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14625)
- Deployment Configs no longer allow leading or trailing spaces on images 
  - Kubernetes 1.7 will tighten this validation and this will prevent future migrations from being necessary
  - [\#14744](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14744)
- Users may now create routes with empty `spec.tls.destinationCACertificate` fields
  - To preserve backwards compatibility, when the route is retrieved from the `/oapi/v1/routes/*` endpoint it will have a synthetic certificate injected. Retrieving the route from the new `/apis/route.openshift.io/v1` endpoint will show the new empty value.
  - [\#14818](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14818)
- When creating builds via the new `/apis/build.openshift.io/v1` endpoint pruning will be automatically defaulted
  - Builds created via the old API are unaffected. Callers may set the limit high to avoid pruning
  - [\#14845](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14845)

### Features

#### Support API aggregation in OpenShift

API aggregation is a key Kubernetes feature that will make it easier to extend Kubernetes clusters. The 3.6 release enables aggregation as tech preview and includes the Kubernetes 1.7 APIs. Its primary purpose in 3.6 is to support the service catalog.

[\#14513](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14513)

#### Add `httpd` images and quickstart

The `httpd` image makes it easy to serve content to users, proxy, or extend with custom support for Apache modules. This image is added to the default image streams along with a quickstart template.

[\#14660](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14660)

#### Enable schema2 by default for the integrated registry

Now that a significant fraction of all users have access to Docker 1.10, enable schema2 support in the registry by default. This will allow Docker 1.10+ engines to push images using the new schema and sets the stage for future improvements in images.

[\#13428](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13428)

#### Deploy service catalog via `oc cluster up`

The `--service-catalog` flag on `oc cluster up` will deploy the new service catalog and configure the instance
with support for the template broker and the new service catalog UI. This feature is tech preview in OpenShift 3.6.

[\#14630](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14630)

#### Kubernetes objects can request image resolution

Kubernetes objects like `Deployments` and `StatefulSets` can now add an alpha annotation to request image stream resolution from any `image` field in their pod specs. If an image stream tag with matching name and tag exist, the value of the image will be replaced with the latest tag in that stream.  Use `oc set image-lookup` to configure the flag.

[\#14795](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14795)

#### Builds now support the `valueFrom` field to inject dynamic values into environment or labels

Builds, like pods, can use the `valueFrom` field on each label or environment variable to leverage data from the parent build. This allows some limited dynamic properties to be set into each build result.

[\#14749](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14749)

## Backwards Compatibility

- The experimental command `oc import docker-compose` has been removed [\#13795](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13795)
  - Work has moved to the [kompose project](http://kompose.io)
- The `status.unavailableReplicas` field on deployment configs no longer accepts negative numbers [\#14046](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14046)
- The extended certificate validation feature in the router is now much stricter [\#13897](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13897)
  - In order to ensure that buggy, malicious, or invalid certificates cannot crash a router the extended certificate feature now decodes and then re-encodes certificates from routes. Only a known set of allowed PEM blocks and certificate types will be accepted, including the common RSA and ECSDA variants of both public and private keys.
  - If you are upgrading your cluster and have not disabled extended certification (on by default) you should start a test router instance and verify that all routes successfully load before completing your rollout.
  - Routes that fail extended validation are taken out of rotation and have a status field message set indicating they are not accepted.


## Changes

[Roadmap for the v3.6 release](https://ci.openshift.redhat.com/releases_overview.html#3.6)

[v3.6.0-alpha.2](https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/v3.6.0-alpha.2) (2017-06-07) [Full Changelog](https://github.com/openshift/origin/compare/v3.6.0-alpha.1...v3.6.0-alpha.2)


## API

- Add fields to builds that display the status of build results [\#13307](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13307)
  - A series of stages and steps are part of build status and populated by the builder.
- Two fields are added to build config spec to control how many successful and failed builds are preserved on the cluster [\#13788](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13788)
- The `spec.tls.destinationCACertificate` field on a route is now optional - routers that don't allow defaulting will reject this route

### Features

#### Tech preview of cluster federation

Cluster workload federation is nearing beta status in Kubernetes and is now part of the OpenShift distribution.  The `kubefed` binary is built as part of Origin and will help stand up a tech preview cluster.

- Enable preliminary support for origin federation [\#14239](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14239)


#### Simulate cluster capacity

The cluster capacity command emulates the Kubernetes scheduler for a set of pod workloads and estimates how many pods can be scheduled on a cluster.

- Add cluster capacity image to OpenShift [\#14258](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14258)


#### Enable Garbage Collection on OpenShift resources

The [garbage collection feature in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/) is now stable and enabled in OpenShift. OpenShift controllers like deployment configs, build configs, and templates set owner references on the objects they create, which means deleting a deployment config will now automatically clean up the replication controllers and pods created by the deployment. The web console uses owner information to better organize resources and can now delete resources when they have changed. See the documentation for more on how to leverage garbage collection to manage cleanup.

- shared GC [\#14358](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14358)


#### Improvements to network egress policy

This release improves egress network policy (handled by an egress router) to make managing traffic leaving namespaces easier via DNS name support on destinations and also targeting multiple destinations.

- sdn: Support DNS names for egress network policy [\#13002](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13002)
- egress: Allow multiple destinations in egress-router [\#13837](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13837)


#### Use git references like tags and GitHub/GitLab pull request links in builds

Git branches and tags are both represented as ""references"" inside of a repository. GitHub adds references in Git for each pull request, but to use that reference in an OpenShift build we must first `fetch` the
information from the remote server. The `ref` field on a build's Git source specification can now point
to any valid Git reference and OpenShift will attempt to retrieve that ref, allowing pull requests to
be spawned for a specific build. 

- builds: Allow the `ref` field on builds to point to any Git reference [\#13893](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13893)
- builds: Enable fetch from oc new-app, start-build, source lookup [\#14025](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14025)
- builds: Fix overlap between branch and ref names [\#14103](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14103)


#### Reference OpenShift image streams from Kubernetes resources

OpenShift image streams make it easy to decouple image management from deployment. Image streams can now be used directly from Kubernetes resources like StatefulSets, Jobs, CronJobs, Deployments, or  DaemonSets via the new `lookupPolicy` that has been added to image streams. The `oc set image-lookup`  command allows you to mark an image stream within your project as being a local reference:

```
$ oc import-image mysql:latest
$ oc set image-lookup mysql
```

Now you can reference the image `mysql:latest` from within a Kubernetes controller and the corresponding image stream tag will be used:

```
$ oc run --image=mysql:latest --restart=OnFailure myjob
$ oc get pods
```

The pod created by the job will use the image tagged as `latest` in the image stream `mysql`. Builds, pods, jobs, replicasets, and replication controllers will all respect these settings, and administrators can configure their image policy to add new resources.

- Extended test for local name resolution [\#13210](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13210)


#### Trigger updates to Kubernetes deployments and daemon sets on image change

The image trigger controller has been upgraded and now supports updating deployments, stateful sets, daemon sets, and cron jobs whenever an image stream tag is updated. A new alpha annotation can be set on the resource to describe which image stream tag should cause an update.

To update a DaemonSet whenever the image stream tag 'image:latest' in namespace 'namespace1' changes,  run:

```
$ oc set triggers daemonset/monitoring --from-image=namespace1/image:latest -c main
```

You can remove a trigger by adding the `--remove` flag. This allows you to run an OpenShift build
or run a scheduled import to keep your applications up to date..

Trigger updates are alpha in 3.6.0.

- Update Kubernetes resources on image change [\#13242](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13242)


#### Build cleanup policy

Build configs now support two parameters to control how many successful and failed builds are retained. By default, no limit is set and all builds are retained. The fields are  `spec.failedBuildsHistoryLimit` and `spec.successfulBuildsHistoryLimit`.

- Cleanup policy for builds [\#13788](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13788)


#### Unification with Kubernetes authorization and core code

The v3.6.0 release integrates a large number of changes the OpenShift team has contributed to 
Kubernetes around security, authorization, RBAC, and core code refactoring. While this will continue for several releases, the OpenShift and Kubernetes RBAC resources are being aligned and the primary API going forward for RBAC will be the Kubernetes version. The existing APIs will remain, especially those that expose features not yet supported in Kubernetes like scoped tokens.

Starting in this release, all OpenShift RBAC resources are automatically migrated to Kubernetes RBAC resources. Users should not see any change in behavior while these migrations occur.

Future releases will include migrating from SecurityContextConstraints to PodSecurityPolicy as well naming and policy updates to system managed policies.

- Use upstream system:masters authorizer [\#14006](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14006)
  - Switch to policy watch [\#14194](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14194)
- Use upstream namespace cleanup controller [\#13587](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13587)
- Use bootstrap cluster roles from kube [\#14026](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14026)

- Use upstream initialization for most controllers [\#14126](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14126)
- Use upstream remote authentication and authorization [\#14011](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14011)
- Use upstream initialization for the replication controller [\#14033](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14033)
- Synchronize OpenShift RBAC to Kubernetes RBAC [\#14064](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14064)
  - Split resource and non-resource rules during conversion [\#14454](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/14454)


#### End to end TLS - never generate a certificate again!

The [service serving certificate](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/dev_guide/secrets.html#service-serving-certificate-secrets) feature makes it easy to generate a valid TLS server certificate for your applications for securely serving HTTPS within a cluster. The router is now enabled to automatically reencrypt traffic to services that use these certificates for routes that specify a blank `spec.tls.destinationCACertificate` field. When a cluster is configured with a default wildcard certificate, this means that you can deploy applications to OpenShift that are secured end to end without having to generate or manage your own certificates.

See the [Prometheus example](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/prometheus/prometheus.yaml#L54)
for this in action. The service requests generation of a secret `prometheus-tls` containing a TLS serving certificate for `prometheus.NAMESPACE.svc`, and the route points to the service with the TLS type `Reencrypt`, but without a `destinationCACertificate`. The router will automatically fill in the `service-ca.crt` file, which is available in every pod.


#### Sign and verify image signatures

OpenShift has natively supported detached signing certificates on images for several releases, and this release adds a new CLI command to make it easy for an administrator to verify the signatures on images manually or as part of an automated image publish flow. This allows the web UI and CLI to show information to the end user about the state of the signature.

See `oc adm verify-image-signature` for more.

- Authorization
  - The `attributeRestrictions` field in subject access reviews is deprecated and will be removed in a future release, to be consistent with the new approach of having multiple resource types for access reviews. [\#13466](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13466)
- Networking:
  - CIDRs that are provided to ClusterNetwork, HostSubnet, and EgressNetworkPolicy must now be valid and in canonical form to prevent accidental leaks of network info. [\#13508](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13508)

### Features

#### Add a Service Broker for Templates

Templates allow users in OpenShift to easily define, share, and deploy precanned applications. The new service broker will allow any template to be
exposed in the service catalog and then consumed by end users. The broker will initially support deploying the template inside of the user's project,
but eventually allow templates to be used to deployed on other clusters and linked back to the end user.

To support the service broker, a new resource has been added to projects - the TemplateInstance. This lets you declaratively instantiate a template
and then in the future update that template.

Template service broker is tech preview for OpenShift 3.6

- Template service broker [\#12953](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12953)

#### Add metrics to routers

The router has been upgraded to return Prometheus metrics for routes and the pods under those routes.  New clusters will have the `ROUTER_METRICS_TYPE` environment variable set to `haproxy` and `ROUTER_LISTEN_ADDR` set to `0.0.0.0:1935`, which turns on metrics on port 1935 (protected by the `ROUTER_STATS_PASSWORD` and user).  

The exposed metrics describe per route, service, and pod information about the traffic flowing over the routers, and can be gathered by an Prometheus capable collector to report information about edge traffic.

* Expose metrics in the router [\#13337](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13337)

#### Support F5 partitions in the router

F5 BigIP servers allow for multiple active ""partitions"" to be managed for security and failure separation at the API level.  This change adds support for targeting a partition from the F5 router management code and makes it possible for OpenShift to manage only a subset of a given F5 router.

* Support F5 partition paths [\#13391](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13391)


#### Add webhook support to builds for GitLab and BitBucket

Like the GitHub and generic web hooks, this allows users to create a webhook trigger with `oc set triggers` and then use that webhook from
a GitLab or BitBucket repository. The hook supports extracting the commit message and author and adding it to the trigger cause.

- Support gitlab and bitbucket webhooks [\#13389](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13389)

#### Control which registries can be imported from

A new configuration flag has been added to the OpenShift config that limits which registries users can import images from by default. Administrators
who can create images directly via the API can import any image, but regular users will receive an error if they import from an unsupported registry.

By default, the list of registries is set to the important publicly hosted registries.

- Allow administrators to control which registries can be imported [\#13313](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13313)


#### Send events when builds are started or complete

A new event is sent when a build starts running, and when it succeeds, fails, or is cancelled another event will be reported. This makes it easier
to see the timeline of events in the CLI and web console.

- Send events on builds [\#13660](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13660)


#### Create and deploy applications with the service catalog in the web console

The service catalog is an important new component of OpenShift and Kubernetes and will be tech preview in 3.6. The web console will expose
binding services provisioned in the catalog to existing applications, as well as deploying new components into a project from the console
(via the template broker). More coming soon!

Please note that we have updated the version numbering scheme for OpenShift to be consistent with the OpenShift version history to minimize impact to the installer and other related documentation and web links.  OpenShift 3.6 replaces version number 1.6, and will be based on Kubernetes 1.6.

## Changes

[Roadmap for the 3.6 release](https://ci.openshift.redhat.com/releases_overview.html#3.6)

[v3.6.0-alpha.0](https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/v3.6.0-alpha.0) (2017-03-21) [Full Changelog](https://github.com/openshift/origin/compare/v1.5.0-rc.0...v3.6.0-alpha.0)


## API

### Move OpenShift API resources to their own API groups

API groups in Kubernetes allow extension of core APIs and better separation of unrelated API types.
In this release we are introducing API groups for all OpenShift API resources so that in the future
they can be used as extensions to a base Kubernetes distribution. These resources continue to be available
at `/oapi/v1`, but clients should begin using the new paths.

New API groups are available from the OpenShift API server at:

- `/apis/apps.openshift.io/v1`: DeploymentConfigs
- `/apis/authorization.openshift.io/v1`: OpenShift role based access control
- `/apis/build.openshift.io/v1`: Build configs and builds
- `/apis/image.openshift.io/v1`: Images, ImageStreams, and other supporting resources
- `/apis/oauth.openshift.io/v1`: OpenShift OAuth resources like ClientAuthorization and Tokens
- `/apis/network.openshift.io/v1`: Network policy for openshift-sdn and NetworkEgressPolicy
- `/apis/project.openshift.io/v1`: Projects and project requests for role based access to namespaces
- `/apis/quota.openshift.io/v1`: ClusterQuota and supporting namespaced resources
- `/apis/route.openshift.io/v1`: Routes
- `/apis/security.openshift.io/v1`: PodSecurityPolicyReview resources
- `/apis/template.openshift.io/v1`: Templates
- `/apis/user.openshift.io/v1`: User and group resources

Stored templates, configuration, and client code intended for use with 3.6 and above can substitute the 
`apiVersion` field for an object with `GROUP/v1`. CLI code will continue to generate objects with the
legacy apiVersion `v1` to enable working with older versions. On many commands you can use
`--output-version` to indicate the new version

- API groups [\#12986](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12986)
  - image: mutate group admission attributes to ensure grouped resources are captured [\#13421](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13421)
  - cli: Fix bulk generator to prefer legacy group [\#13457](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13457)
- Builds
  - All fields related to extended builds have been marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release [\#13063](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13063)
  - Build webhooks return structured data including the created build name [\#12573](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12573)

### Features

#### Template refinements

The OpenShift 1.5 release added a few new features for templates, including the ability to have integer, boolean, array, or map inputs (using the `${{PARAMETER}}` syntax). This alpha also allows templates to span namespaces if you parameterize the `namespace` field of your objects. Previously, all namespace fields were stripped, but a template object with a namespace that references a parameter will now be filled in, allowing you to instantiate cluster scoped resources that refer to a named resource in the template. `oc process --local` has been added to allow you to locally transform a template for use with a regular Kubernetes server - the transformation is performed on the client instead of requesting the server do the transformation.
- templates: Allow namespace specification via parameter in templates [#12918](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12918)
- templates: Allow templates to be processed locally with `--local` [#12996](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12996)

#### Ingress objects in the HAProxy router (tech preview)

The HAProxy router can be configured to expose Kubernetes Ingress objects. This feature is still under development and may change as more security protections are put into place. Not all features supported by Routes are available, including some advanced annotations.
- router: Support Ingress resources with the HAProxy router (tech preview) [#12416](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12416)
- router: Allow restricting Ingress objects from changing their hostname values [#12653](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12653)
- router: Fix Ingress compatibility with f5 [#12843](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12843)

#### Multicast and NetworkPolicy support for OpenShift SDN (tech preview)

Multicast and NetworkPolicy support are now available in OpenShift SDN for testing. Please see the documentation for more info on how to enable them.
- sdn: Implement NetworkPolicies with PodSelectors [#12448](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12448)
- sdn: Support multicast [#12494](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12494)
- sdn: Filter disallowed outbound multicast [#12650](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12650)
- sdn: Allow multicast for VNID 0 [#12839](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12839)
- sdn: Fixed the multicast CIDR (was 224.0.0.0/3 not /4) [#12852](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12852)

#### Node bootstrap (tech preview)

For the last several releases Kubernetes and OpenShift have been preparing to allow nodes to ""self-register"" in cloud environments where nodes can be spun up or down dynamically. In the v1.5.0 release the new experimental `--bootstrap` flag is available on nodes and will have the node request a client certificate from the master, then request a serving certificate, then download its node configuration from a config map. Cloud VM images can be ""baked"" with an account capable of self registration and the new `oc adm certificate approve` command can be used to approve the client and serving certificate requests.

This feature is still experimental and may change in future releases.
- cluster: Support a simple bootstrap mode for nodes in preparation for self-join [#9547](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9547)

#### Basic monitoring

`oc cluster up` now installs a Prometheus and Heapster template to the `kube-system` namespace - as an administrator you can switch to that namespace and easily install them for monitoring your cluster.

Prometheus can monitor your nodes, apiserver, and services labelled with the appropriate annotations and record metrics or fire alerts. Launch and expose Prometheus with:

```
$ oc project kube-system
$ oc new-app prometheus
$ oc expose svc/prometheus
```

See the Prometheus website for more info.

To use a standalone Heapster instance with no historical metrics, run:

```
$ oc project kube-system
$ oc new-app heapster-standalone
```

Autoscaling should now be enabled for your cluster. This is useful for smaller clusters where you don't need historical data as provided by Hawkular.
- clusterup: Install Prometheus and Heapster templates to the `kube-system` namespace on cluster up [#12844](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12844)
- examples: Add a standalone Heapster example [#12812](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12812)
- examples: Add a Prometheus example [#12793](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12793)

#### Debugging the masters

In order to make it easier to capture profiles and other debug information about a running cluster, the `/debug/pprof` endpoints are 
exposed on apiservers, controllers, and nodes, but protected via a new `cluster-debugger` role.  Since the debug endpoint can extract sensitive information from the cluster, you should only give that role to trusted actors.

```
# Retrieve and process a heap dump from the master as a cluster-debugger
$ oc get --raw /debug/pprof/heap > /tmp/heap
$ go tool pprof PATH_TO_OPENSHIFT_BINARY /tmp/heap

# Capture a 30s CPU profile from the master as a cluster-debugger
$ oc get --raw /debug/pprof/profile > /tmp/cpuprofile
$ go tool pprof PATH_TO_OPENSHIFT_BINARY /tmp/cpuprofile
```
- admin: Add a new cluster-debugger role and enable debugging on masters [#12895](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12895)

## Backwards Compatibility
- As a result of fixing [#12606](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12606), any users who have logged in since upgrading to v1.4.0 will need to log in again and recreate their login information.  Old user identity information from before the v1.4.0 upgrade will still exist in etcd and can be overwritten if necessary.

## Changes

### Console Features

#### Managing project membership

An important feature for people that want to collaborate within the same projects, the new membership management interface lets you add and remove roles to users, groups, and service accounts within your project.

![membership](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/20279874/4aaaa582-aa78-11e6-89ca-803e00ce26f9.gif)

Project administrators have access to view and modify the project’s membership.  Membership management is the only difference between an admin and an editor in the default OpenShift roles.  Cluster administrators can add a description to any role to provide extra information for end users about what that role actually allows.

#### Creating and Adding Secrets for Build and Deployment Configurations

Prior to 1.4 it was very difficult to set up a build against a private git repository from the web console. Previously you had to Import YAML/JSON to create your secret and then edit your build’s YAML to make it use that secret.

Now you can expand the advanced build options, create a user/password or SSH key based secret and tell the build to use that when cloning your source. Already have your secret created in that project? You can pick any of your existing ones too.

![new-app-git-secrets](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/20279962/96c3bcd8-aa78-11e6-9075-3bbc0a31ad1f.gif)

While we were making private git repository connections easier to set up, we figured we should improve setting up push and pull against private image registries as well. The build configuration editor lets you set up a push or pull secret in case the image you are building from or the image stream you are pushing to is on a secure registry.  Similarly the new deployment configuration editor allows you to specify a pull secret.

#### Editor for deployment configuration strategy, hooks, and secrets

We’ve had a GUI editor for build configurations for a few releases now, but now we’ve added one for deployment configurations too. From the new editor you can:
- Switch your deployment strategy
- Tweak advanced deployment settings like the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during - the deployment
- Add, edit, or remove deployment lifecycle hooks
- Change the image being deployed
- Set a pull secret for the registry your image is being pulled from
- Add, edit, or remove environment variables for the pods that will be deployed

![dc-editor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/20280006/c91ed50a-aa78-11e6-91c3-6827da086d20.gif)

Many of the existing editing actions we supported still exist as separate actions, such as editing health checks, or configuring different resource limits.  If you want to make a number of changes without triggering a deployment for each change, you can now Pause your deployment, make all the changes you want, and then Resume it.  Pausing will prevent any deployment from happening no matter whether it was automatically or manually triggered.

#### Organization of Add to Project Catalog / Customizable Categories

Our existing “Add to Project” catalog could become quite cluttered when dealing with builder images with many versions, or lots of templates with slight differences. In the past we had focused on minimizing the number of clicks to getting you to something running, but now we’ve focused on helping you find what you are actually looking for.  The main catalog page now only contains high level categories “Languages” and “Technologies” and underneath those are sub-categories, such as “Java” or “Data Stores”.  Diving into one of those you’ll find re-designed tiles for builder images and templates.  Different versions of the same builder image now all roll-up to the same tile with the semantically latest version automatically selected.  We have also taken a hard look at all of our out of the box images and templates and focused on providing better display names, descriptions, and categorization.

![catalog-reorg](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/20280055/ecee26f2-aa78-11e6-8db9-9e2c091784fe.gif)

Don’t like our categories? Now you can [customize the categories](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/web_console_customization.html#configuring-catalog-categories) and subcategories as much as you want. 

#### Filtering and Sorting the Project List

We have a class of users for OpenShift that manage many projects on behalf of a larger set of developers.  To make things easier for people with a large number of projects, the project list now has a text filter on name, display name, description, and project creator.  It also allows sorting on several of these attributes.

![project-list-filter-sort](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/20280143/408ab514-aa79-11e6-8f28-4d49900ed371.png)

#### Quota Warnings

User working within quota constraints had a hard time before knowing when they had run out of quota unless they went to check the Quota page.  We wanted to add some checks for the most common scenarios where we people have problems with quota.  You’ll now get quota warnings:
- On the overview - this is a generic warning if anything in your quota is at its limit
- On the overview pod count visualizations - when we think you are unable to reach your scale target due to quota
- If you try to create something and we know you are out of quota for that resource
- If you try to create something and we think it will cause you to exceed quota for a resource

#### Bookmarkable Page States

Sometimes the little things can make all the difference. Have you been annoyed that you couldn’t send someone straight to the log tab for a pod? Now you can! Tab selection, label filters, and several other options that change page state are now persisted to the URL throughout the console.  You can bookmark and share with others.

#### Support for new and beta Kubernetes features

Create storage using storage classes
- If your cluster admin sets up storage classes, then they will be available for you to pick from in the “Create Storage” page.

Deployments and ReplicaSets
- Will fit in seamlessly on the overview alongside your existing Deployment Configurations
- Will appear on the Applications -> Deployments page
- Support many of the actions we already supported for Deployment Configurations (excluding the new editor)

Roll-up of PetSet pods on the Overview
- A PetSet’s pods will roll up into a single card with a pod count visualization like the other controllers
- You’ll be able to see metrics on the overview for the pods in the petset

## Backwards Compatibility
- HAProxy router template format has changed
  - As part of the expanded features added to the HAProxy router in 1.3, a configuration file format change was necessary to the internal structure used by the router config template (the `haproxy.config.template`) file.  Instructions for adapting to the new format are located [here](https://github.com/rajatchopra/routing_data_structure_changes/blob/master/README.md)
- Jenkins auto-deployment has been disabled - see [#10260](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10260) for more

## API Changes
- Networking
  - Many of the network API objects have much stricter validation. [#10466](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10466)
- Routes
  - All backends in a route may be set to have zero weight, which means no traffic should be sent to that backend. [#10428](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10428)

## Features

[v1.3.0-rc1](https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/v1.3.0-rc1) (2016-08-07)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/openshift/origin/compare/v1.3.0-alpha.3...v1.3.0-rc1)

### Add setting and viewing route weights from the CLI

The A/B route balancing feature now has a CLI command to manage it `oc set route-backends` and route weights show up in the `oc get` and `oc describe` commands for the route.
Routes may have one or more optional backend services with weights controlling how much traffic flows to each service. Traffic is assigned proportional to the combined weights
of each backend. A weight of zero means that the backend will receive no traffic. If all weights are zero the route will not send traffic to any backends.

You can bulk set route backends by specifying their name and weight:

```
$ oc set route-backends myroute prod=99 canary=1
```

Which will send 99% of traffic to the `prod` service and 1% to the `canary` service. If the service does not exist no traffic will be sent.  You can keep the service listed as
a backend but not send traffic to it by specifying weight 0:

```
$ oc set route-backends myroute prod=1 canary=0
```

See the help for more advanced incremental adjustments (`--adjust canary=+10%`).
- Add CLI support for routes with multiple backends [#10551](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10551).

### Support bare-metal, highly available IPs for services

For users deploying onto bare metal without a cloud provider, access to highly available TCP load balancing can be difficult. OpenShift 1.3 extends the supported ip-failover
router HA solution to also enable HA Kube services with failover. Administrators would configure HA router nodes and then ensure that a block of IPs is routed to those nodes
in the IP failover configuration. That block would then be configured in the OpenShift `master-config.yaml`:

```
networkConfig:
  ingressIPNetworkCIDR: 172.46.0.0/16
```

This is the default behavior, and can be disabled by setting the value equal to `0.0.0.0/32`. When a service of `type=LoadBalancer` is created, a new IP would be assigned to the
service and traffic would flow to that service. Note that running with a cloud provider disables this feature since the providers native service load balancer is used.
- Support network ingress on arbitrary IPs [#9454](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9454)
- Add a default ingress ip range [#10500](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10500)

### Image Policy API

Image policy allows you to manage which images are allowed to run on the cluster and perform resolution of image tags to image digests on demand (to lock the executed version).
Policy allows:
- Block images outside of the integrated registry from being used in pods
- Require the presence of an annotation on the underlying image (not settable by end users) to run the image
- Allow integrators to perform security scans of images and then block the image from being executed on the platform.

The default configuration will block images that are annotated in the internal registry - if the annotation `images.openshift.io/deny-execution` is set on an image referenced
by a pod to `true`, OpenShift will prevent that image from being run. This can be used by an external scanner to block certain images from being used.

See [the image policy documentation](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/image_policy.html) for more on configuring policy.
- Add image policy enforcement [#8995](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8995)

### Build integrations with the cluster more easily

The new `oc observe` command is an experimental tool for reacting to changes in your Kubernetes cluster and building scripted interactions. It allows you to easily
get notified of changes to a particular resource type (like services, deployments, namespaces, persistent volumes) and invoke a command.

For example, if you want to send an email to your admin every time a node stops being reachable, create a script that takes

```
$ cat mail.sh
#!/bin/sh
if [[ $2 != 'False' ]]; then
  touch ""/tmp/ready/$1""
  exit 0
fi
if [[ -f ""/tmp/ready/$1"" ]]; then
  echo mail -s ""$1 went DOWN!"" admin@mycompany.com ""We're down at $(datetime)""
fi
rm ""/tmp/ready/$1""

$ oc observe node -a '{{ range .status.conditions }}{{ if eq .type ""Ready"" }}{{ .status }}{{ end }}{{ end }}' --output gotemplate -- ./mail.sh
```

Whenever a node transitions from having condition `Ready` with status `True` to status `False`, an email will be sent to your admin.  See the `oc observe` help for
more suggestions and explanation of how observe can help you build simple integrations.

You can get observe as a Docker image via `docker pull openshift/observe:latest` - the `oc observe` command is the entrypoint and you can bind mount a kubeconfig file
to `/root/.kube/config`.
- Observe command [#4196](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/4196)

### Improve the OAuth Grant page

OpenShift embeds a full featured OAuth server for managing access to cluster resources. The OAuth authorization grant page has been improved to describe the scopes being
requested, the impact those scopes might have, and to warn users of any potential security risks. In addition, the grant page now allows the user to select which scopes
to grant.

## Backwards Compatibility
- Image Streams
  - In order to tag an image from one image stream into another via `oc tag` or the API, you must have permission to pull the image, not just permission to view the source image stream.  Running `oadm policy reconcile cluster-roles` will alter default roles so that tagging continues to work as normal.

## API Changes
- DNS:
  - SRV record responses have changed significantly to conform to new features enabled in Kubernetes 1.3. More details in [the 1.3 release notes issue](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/issues/2507#issuecomment-236950715). Callers must now explicitly request the port by name and protocol to get the port info (e.g. `dig @server _http._tcp.kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`)
- Builds:
  - Build Request API should return NotFound if the parent build config does not exist [#9763](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9763)
  - Reject ImageStreamTag references on builds and build configs that are not well formed as validation errors [#9945](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9945)
  - Support YAML payloads for generic webhooks [#10031](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10031)
  - Properly mark secrets field as not required in swagger [#10038](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10038)
  - Disallow build config LastVersion from getting smaller - clients will receive a validation error if `status.latestVersion` is a smaller integer than the stored value [#9568](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9568)
- Secrets:
  - Secret data may now be specified in string form (rather than base64 encoded) via the new `stringData` map, which is write-only and takes precedence over keys with the same name specified in `data`  [#9663](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9663)
- PodSecurityPolicy Review API (alpha)
  - The review APIs have been updated to take a `PodTemplateSpec` struct instead of a `PodSpec` struct, so that annotations on the pod template can be validated. [#10007](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10007)

## Component updates
- Updated to Kubernetes [1.3.0](https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/commit/283137936a498aed572ee22af6774b6fb6e9fd94) with patch set [Origin stable-20160804](https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/commit/507d3a7b242634b131710cfdfd55e3a1531ffb1b)
  - Backported a number of 1.3.x fixes, including a serious regression in parallel pod start performance with [#10111](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10111)
- Updated to Docker distribution [2.4.0](https://github.com/openshift/docker-distribution/commit/596ca8b86acd3feebedae6bc08abf2a48d403a14) with patch set [5594335](https://github.com/openshift/docker-distribution/commit/559433598c7be9d30d6cfc5cad5b5dfdb686725c)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/openshift/origin/compare/v1.3.0-alpha.2...v1.3.0-alpha.3)

### PetSets and Init Containers

Kubernetes 1.3 includes two new features in alpha designed for running clustered software: PetSets and init containers.  [PetSets](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/petset/) make it easy to run a consistent set of pods that have individual network identities and are able to have unique persistent volumes.  [Init containers](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/production-pods/#handling-initialization) are run sequentially before the other containers in a pod are started and allow pod authors to read and write volume data, download binaries, wait for other components to start, and other initialization style tasks.

The [examples/pets](https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/pets) directory contains a number of examples of how to use PetSets. As alpha features, no backwards compatibility in future Kubernetes or OpenShift versions is guaranteed and may change significantly.  Please provide feedback on these features.
- Enable petsets in origin [#9972](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9972)
- Enable security limits around init containers [#9973](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9973)

### Improvements to Jenkins

- jenkins: Generate a password for Jenkins [#10163](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10163)
- jenkins: Use official maven image for slave pods in sample pipeline [#9807](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9807)
- console: addition of a dedicated Pipelines page

### Upgrading to Docker Registry 2.4, cross-repository linking, and better usage tooling

This release contains an upgrade to Docker distribution 2.4 which contains many performance and usability improvements, including cross repo mounting when pushing images that already exist in the OpenShift registry.  Support for the new schema2 storage format for images is now available, although it must be manually enabled in order to accept images pushed in the schema2 format (to preserve compatibility with older Docker versions).
- registry: Check pull access when tagging imagestreams [#10109](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10109)
- registry: Consider schema v2 layers when pruning [#9713](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9713)
- registry: User can get only blobs he's able to see [#9819](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9819)
- registry: Ensure that download access to registry blobs is controlled by access to the image stream [#9593](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9593)

#### Bearer token and anonymous access

The registry now supports the the [Docker Token Authentication Specification](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/auth/token/), which enables bearer token authentication and anonymous access. Grant the `system:image-puller` role to the `system:unauthenticated` group to allow unauthenticated image pulls from a namespace:

```
oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:unauthenticated -n mynamespace
```
- registry: Allow anonymous registry access [#9887](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9887)

#### Image usage reporting

A new top level administrative command `oadm top` has been added to support administrative insight into the images used by the platform.  Using `oadm top images` will show you information about the top images in use and how much space is in use in your registry.  `oadm top imagestreams` will show you more detail about the total referenced size of each image stream and the number of layers allocated.
- images: Provide an administrative image usage report tool [#9587](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9587)

### Support all Deployment features on DeploymentConfigs and add the `oc rollout` command

Alpha 3 adds a ton of new capabilities onto deployments.  As of alpha 3, all options from Kubernetes Deployments are supported on deployment config objects, such as pausing, setting a ""wait"" period for readiness to stabilize after a deployment, and more information returned in the status of the deployment.  In addition, `oc rollout (history|pause|resume|undo)` now supports both Kubernetes deployments and OpenShift deployment configs.  Over time, `oc deploy` will be replaced by subcommands under `oc rollout` as Kubernetes deployments gain parity with OpenShift deployments.

Upstream deployments are now enabled for use (in beta) and future releases will add tools for easily converting between them (for when you want deployments that trigger on image changes or deployment hooks).  
- deployments: Return API errors on not found imagestreams/deploymentconfigs [#9727](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9727)
- Enabled deployments from Kubernetes as a beta resource - future releases will contain tools for migrating between resources.
- Add paused field in deployment config describer [#10159](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10159)
- deploy: pin retries to a const and forget correctly in the dc loop [#9756](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9756)
- deploy: set gracePeriodSeconds on deployer deletion [#9802](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9802)
- deploy: move cli-related packages in cmd [#9692](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9692)
- deployments: Ensure the test deployment invariant is maintained [#9839](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9839)
- deploy: set gracePeriod on deployer creation rather than when deleting [#9854](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9854)
- Add MinReadySeconds in deployment configs [#9852](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9852)
- deployments: Handle forbidden errors (due to older permissions) in oc rollback [#9889](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9889)
- Remove deployment trigger warning [#9894](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9894)
- Pause the deployment config before deleting [#9893](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9893)
- oc rollout
- deploy: enqueue configs on pod events [#9953](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9953)
- performance
- Enable replicasets and deployments [#10136](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10136)
- deployments: Collapse deployer into deployments controller [#9691](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9691)
- deployments: Specifying an empty initial image will hold the first deployment until an image is tagged [#9539](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9539)

### Support resizing remote terminals in the CLI (`oc exec|rsh|debug`) and the web console

The exec and attach commands (or more often used with `oc rsh`) are now resizable and correctly handle terminal information, which should improve working inside of containers.  The web console also allows the terminal to be resized.
- cli: Support terminal resizing for exec/attach/run [#9878](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9878)

### seccomp profiles for all containers and allow admin policy on their use

seccomp is a Linux kernel feature that restricts the types of system calls that applications can make.  Kubernetes and Docker have added profiles that prohibit access for containers by default and significantly reduce the possibility of new vulnerabilities in the kernel being exploited by malicious containers.  OpenShift enables this restrictive policy by default, and administrators can allow less restrictive profiles for highly privileged applications via the SecurityContextConstraint API.
- security: Enable seccomp in SecurityContextConstraints [#9715](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9715)

### Extended builds (alpha)
- Extended builds [#9813](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9813)

### Support for internal communication using Protobuf and general performance improvements

The Kubernetes and OpenShift APIs now support an alternate serialization format to JSON: [Protobuf]().  Protobuf is a binary format that requires less CPU and memory to encode and decode and offers significant benefits when internal components of the cluster are interacting.  Clients may request Protobuf responses by specifying an `Accept` HTTP header with the value `application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf`.

```
$ curl -H ""Accept: application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf"" https://localhost:8443/api/v1/pods | hexdump -C
```

By default, all cluster internal communication will use Protobuf, but it must be enabled via configuration.  Instructions for upgrading are described here: https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/issues/2214.

The Protobuf format is considered internal-only at this point and is not recommended for widespread client use.
- Add protobuf to OpenShift types [#9793](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9793)
- Enable protobuf in Origin for server-to-server [#9814](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9814)

Other significant performance improvements occurred in this release, including a number of memory usage reductions in the API server and controllers.  

### Enhancements to the `imagebuilder` library

The imagebuilder library for building squashed Dockerfiles has added a secret mount facility that allows builds to mount in secrets for the duration of the build that are not committed into the final Docker image.  The `--mount SRC:DST` flag is now supported on `oc ex dockerbuild` and has the same behavior as `docker run -v`.  Mount secrets are only supported on Docker 1.10 or newer.
- Allow a mounted repository to be injected into yum [#9947](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9947)

In addition, the library has now been moved to its own GitHub repository at https://github.com/openshift/imagebuilder.
- Switch to using github.com/openshift/imagebuilder [#10216](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10216)

### Service Serving Cert Signer (alpha)

If your service needs to serve TLS as TLS enabled, OpenShift can automatically generate and sign a serving certificate that is valid for your service's DNS name.  The signing CA certificate is injected into pods, so any pod in the cluster can communicate with your service and confirm that it is properly secured.  See https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/2324 for details.

### Scoped tokens for service accounts that act as OAuth clients

If your service needs to confirm the identity of a user on the OpenShift platform and/or perform actions on their behalf, you can now leverage our OAuth server to request scoped tokens for a user.  See https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#oauth for details.

### Support for quota that spans multiple projects and performance improvements (alpha)

If you need to constrain the number of resources that particular user can create, but don't want to restrict individual projects, you can create a new ClusterResourceQuota resource that can select multiple projects based on a labels or annotations.  See https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/2596 for details.

A number of other performance improvements have been made to quota for clusters with thousands of individual quotas.
- add oc create clusterquota [#9588](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9588)
- project clusterresourcequota into applicable namespaces [#9609](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9609)
- add a clusterquota reconciliation controller [#9658](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9658)
- add project annotation selectors to cluster quota [#9757](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9757)
- make clusterquota/status endpoint [#9898](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9898)
- UPSTREAM: 29133: use a separate queue for initial quota calculation [#9915](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9915)
- perf improvements
- UPSTREAM: 29134: Improve quota controller performance [#9937](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9937)
- cluster quota to namespace mapping controller [#9558](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9558)
- UPSTREAM: 28351: Add support for kubectl create quota command [#10054](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10054)

### Allow template authors to provide a post-creation message to end users

Templates now have a `message` field that will be displayed to users in the CLI or web console after creating an object from a template. The field will have the same parameterization rules applied as the objects in the template, so you can inject generated fields into a human readable message.
- Adding a field to templates to allow them to deliver a user message w… [#9708](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9708)
- Adding template instructional message to new-app output [#9806](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9806)

### Split traffic between multiple backend services from a route

The HAProxy router now supports splitting the traffic coming to a route across multiple back end services via weighting.  The web console has been updated to allow users to set the weighting and show balance between them.

The API field for balancing is `spec.alternateBackends` on the route and can be an array of 0..3 services to spread traffic across.  The weight of the normal backend (the `spec.to` field) defaults to 100, and the combined value of all the weights sets the relative proportions of traffic.
- routes: Add A/B definitions to routes [#9119](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9119)
- router: Allow round-robin algorithm as a choice in passthrough/reencrypt [#9710](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9710)
- console: visualization of alternate backends and ability to add and edit multiple backends for a route.

### Router enhancements to defend against DDOS attacks

The router has been hardened to provide more protection against DDOS attacks.  Administrators can set configuration flags on the router to apply blanket policy on connections across all routes, as well as configure a few routes specifically.
- router: Implement basic DDOS protections in the HAProxy template router [#9810](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9810)
- router: Allow for configurable server side timeouts on routes [#9671](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9671)
- router: Allow rate-limits on the router to be defaulted [#10125](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/10125)

### Egress Firewalls for namespaces

A new resource `EgressNetworkPolicy` has been added which controls how traffic exits a namespace.  Administrators can use these as outbound firewalls when using the multi-tenant SDN network.  Each rule can be an allow or deny rule, and targets a CIDR.  Since policy can only be changed by administrators, you can update your out of the box project template to include a firewall policy that applies to individual namespaces, and then later change to be more permissive.
- Egress firewall support [#9227](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9227) https://trello.com/c/iH5IjWI8/244-8-basic-egress-firewall

### Enable Kerberos authentication in the CLI

`oc login` now allows Kerberos authentication against a KDC as a supported authentication mode on Linux.
- Add krb5-devel to build release image [#9716](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9716)
- Load versioned gssapi libs [#9820](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9820)

### Web console improvements

### Jenkins Pipeline Improvements

The web console overhaul continues - this release more deeply embeds Jenkins pipeline, while also exposing more information about the state of your applications in summary form.  (to try it out yourself read [the example guide](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/README.md))

![9720a0ad-80d8-4101-6d2b-2967e766bac9](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1163175/16216853/443feb44-373c-11e6-81b5-931463870bb7.png)

The build details page now shows a detailed breakdown of the stages in each build using the information provided by Jenkins.

![running-pipeline](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1163175/16216830/f9b2aa9e-373b-11e6-8376-cfa54d64af93.png)

Since the overview page looks best with metrics, you can now install cluster metrics with `oc cluster up --metrics` (you'll want an extra ~1GB of memory available for the full component set) [#9310](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/9310)

### Spin up local clusters easily with `oc cluster up`

This new command makes it easy to launch a new cluster inside of a Docker container.  The command will use your existing Docker connection by default to launch the container, ensuring all the preconditions for a simple all-in-one server are in place before starting the server.  It will then install the router, registry, default image streams, and standard templates before creating a user account for you.

```
$ oc cluster up
-- Checking Docker client ... OK
-- Checking for existing OpenShift container ... OK
-- Checking for openshift/origin:3c2e3b2 image ... OK
-- Checking Docker daemon configuration ... OK
-- Checking for available ports ... OK
-- Checking type of volume mount ... 
   Using nsenter mounter for OpenShift volumes
-- Checking Docker version ... OK
-- Creating volume share ... OK
-- Finding server IP ... 
   Using 172.18.0.96 as the server IP
-- Starting OpenShift container ... 
   Creating initial OpenShift configuration
   Starting OpenShift using container 'origin'
   Waiting for API server to start listening
   OpenShift server started
-- Installing registry ... OK
-- Installing router ... OK
-- Importing image streams ... OK
-- Importing templates ... OK
-- Login to server ... OK
-- Creating initial project ""myproject"" ... OK
-- Server Information ... 
   OpenShift server started.
   The server is accessible via web console at:
       https://172.18.0.96:8443

   You are logged in as:
       User:     developer
       Password: developer

   To login as administrator:
       oc login -u system:admin

$ oc status
```

You can use the `--version=v1.2.0` flag to select an alternate image to use.

### Jenkins Pipeline integration

A core goal of any application platform must be to help developers manage change in their applications (after all, if it's not changing there probably aren't any developers).  As part of OpenShift Origin 1.3 we are deeply integrating Jenkins as a Service to bring developers an out of the box, easy to consume CI and CD pipeline.

The first pieces of this integration have been delivered via integration with OpenShift builds.  When you start a `Jenkinsfile` build type (which is new) a Jenkins instance will be spun up in your project that will execute the build using the Jenkins 2.0 pipeline and Jenkinsfile checked into your Git repo.

```
$ oc cluster up
$ oc new-project pipelineproject
$ oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/jenkinstemplate.json
```

You should see your Jenkins instance spun up in the web console, and then be able to jump into the web console via the router.  At this point you'll need to perform some manual steps to enable things in Jenkins - see https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/README.md for more.

There is a ton of exciting work with CI/CD in the works - stay tuned!

### Automatically sync local changes to the server with `oc rsync --watch` [#8268](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8268)

`oc rsync` now supports a --watch flag which will cause it to continuously monitor the local filesystem and sync changes to the pod as they occur.  This makes it easy to work from an editor or IDE and have those changes show up live in your pods.

### Build run policy - serial, parallel, or latest-only [#8453](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8453)

The build run policy describes the order in which the builds created from a build configuration should run.  There are several out of the box policies:
- Serial - runs each build in the order they were created (the new default)
- Parallel - start builds as soon as they are created (was the previous default)
- SerialLatestOnly - if multiple builds have been created when the last build completes, only build the latest and mark the older ones as skipped

You can change the build policy via the `spec.runPolicy` field on build configurations.

### Improving custom deployments [#8787](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8787)

Custom deployments can now reuse the existing build logic but install custom hooks in any image you want.  See [this mailing list post](http://lists.openshift.redhat.com/openshift-archives/dev/2016-May/msg00037.html) for more details.

In addition, the output of deployments has been greatly streamlined:

```
$ oc logs dc/custom
--> pre: Running hook pod ...
my hook pod ran
--> pre: Success
--> Scaling deployment-2 from 0 to 5
    Scaling deployment-2 up to 3
    Scaling deployment-1 down to 2
--> Scaling deployment-2 from 3 to 5
    Scaling deployment-2 up to 5
    Scaling deployment-1 down to 0
--> Success
```

### Importing docker-compose.yaml files (Experimental)

This release includes an experimental command `oc import docker-compose` that can convert a docker-compose.yaml file into the Kubernetes and OpenShift equivalent, setting up your build pipelines on the cluster as well as all of the deployment artifacts.  It can even identify when containers should be colocated into pods so you can leverage local disk and local network.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/docker-library/docs.git
$ oc import docker-compose -f wordpress/docker-compose.yml
```

OpenShift will warn you if any machine specific or Docker specific concepts that don't translate well to a containerized cluster are being used.

Note that many compose files may assume they can run as root - if you are trying out a new compose application on OpenShift you may want to grant access to run as root to get things working:

```
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default 
```

Please experiment with this feature and open issues if things don't work quite right - we want to make it as easy as possible to bring your containerized applications to OpenShift!

### Squashed docker builds (Experimental)

Dockerfiles create an image **layer** for each instruction. However, these extra layers take time to commit and are often not useful when deploying applications in production.  This release of OpenShift adds a new `oc ex dockerbuild` command that processes a Dockerfile like the `docker build` command, but skips committing layers in between each instruction in the Dockerfile. This can lead to significant speed ups in build times and smaller image sizes.

```
$ oc ex dockerbuild . myimage:latest
```

This feature is experimental while we ensure it has compatibility with `dockerbuild`. In future releases it will be possible to launch Docker builds on OpenShift that use this feature to squash the built output by default.

To see it in action, check out the OpenShift Origin images on the hub:

### Security

#### Scoped Access Tokens [#8393](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8393)

Allows the creation of a token that identifies as the user, but only allows a subset of the user's permissions.  Scopes are restrictive, so a viewer who makes a scoped token with edit rules still only has view rights.  A common use for scoped tokens is to give to a third party the ability to act on your behalf (like a build systems) via the API, but to limit what they can actually do.

Scopes include (but are not limited to)
- `user:info` - gives information about who I am
- `user:check-access` - see what I can do
- `role:edit:my-ns` (token has the edit role in the `my-ns` namespace)

#### Impersonation [#8672](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8672), [#8824](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8824)

Allows a user with the ""impersonate"" permission on a particular user or serviceaccount, the ability to make a request ""as"" that other person.  A `sudoer` role was added to allow a user to impersonate ""system:admin"" so they don't have to have cluster-admin rights all the time.

Delete a project as the cluster admin

```
$ oc delete project/foo --as system:admin
```

Retrieve pods for the current project as the default service account

```
$ oc get pods --as system:serviceaccount:my-ns:default
```

#### Allowing Service Accounts to act as OAuth clients [#8878](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8878)

Some containers in a cluster may want to provide services for end users or other containers.  Our standard solution for that is OAuth, but it's often difficult to make an OAuth client as a regular user.  This feature enables all service accounts to act as OAuth clients, where the secret of the client is the same as the service account token.  When a service account tries to request tokens, those tokens will be scoped to the service account namespace.

#### Add a simple audit record [#8815](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8815)

OpenShift will now log audit information about requests made to the API server to the default logger when the config flag `auditConfig.enabled` is set to `true`.  This includes the user, their action, and whether it succeeded or not.

## Docker 1.9 / 1.10 and Origin

OpenShift Origin 1.2 depends on Docker 1.9.  As a consequence of the recent change to the DockerHub to stop supporting pull-by-digest for images pushed by newer Docker clients, users of OpenShift running Docker 1.10 may experience problems pulling images from the Hub.  We are working on addressing this issue in an upcoming patch release.

## Fixed Bugs
- Ensure that the router locks access to the internal map before generating config, to prevent race conditions [#8993](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8993)
- Prevent users from mutating the status of PVCs and PVs - Kubernetes [#24924](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/24924)
- Enabling the etcd watch cache resulted in watch timeout errors being reported differently, causing issues for the web console - Kubernetes [#25369](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/25369)
- Importing images that had previously failed to import could result in occasional panics - [#8599](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8599)
- Remove the possibility of console CSRF issues via the API proxy - [#8958](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/8958)

---

This is a bug fix release on top of Origin 1.1.x.

## Backwards Compatibility
- Origin v1.1.5 is now compiled on Go 1.6, which may result in changes to runtime GC behavior that may require tuning at high densities and load.  
- Origin v1.1.5 requires Docker 1.8.3 or 1.9.1-23 or higher due to bugs with cGroup limits and systemd.
- The name of the generator for `oc run` that creates DeploymentConfigs changed from `run/v1` to `deploymentconfig/v1` for compatibility with `kubectl`

## Component updates
- Updated to Kubernetes 1.2.0

## Features
- The new Kubernetes 1.2 `ConfigMap` resource is now usable.  You must run `oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles` to grant access to use it for end users.
- Limits, quotas, and quota scopes are now displayed in the web console

## Security and Admin
- Add quota support to emptydirs - when the quota is enabled on an XFS system, nodes will limit the amount of space any given namespace can use on a node to a fixed upper bound. The quota is tied to the `FSGroup` of the namespace - administrators can control this value by editing the namespace directly or allowing users to set FSGroup via security context constraints.
- `DaemonSet` is now limited to cluster admins because pods running under a daemonset are considered to have higher priority than regular pods, and for regular users on the cluster this could be a security issue.
- Administrators can prevent clients from accessing the API by their `User-Agent` header the new `userAgentMatching` config setting
- Access to set `externalIP` on services is now disabled by default, to prevent malicious users from creating services that impersonate other IP addresses in the cluster.  Administrators can selectively enable the field for specific IP ranges.
- The `NO_PROXY` environment variable will now accept a CIDR in a number of places in the code for controlling which IP ranges bypass the default HTTP proxy settings.
- Administrators can now enforce the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` flag via security contexts to require users run without being able to modify the container image
- Administrators can now limit what volume types users can use directly from within a Pod - by default, regular users are now forbidden from directly mounting any of the remote volume type (they must use a PVC)
- 

## Bugs
- Fixed a performance regression in cAdvisor that resulted in long pauses on Kubelet startup
- `oc edit` was not properly displaying all errors when saving an edited resource failed
- Show more information about persistent volume claims and persistent volumes in a number of places in the CLI and web console
- Some commands that used the API PATCH command could fail intermittently when they were executed on the server and another user edited at the same time.
- Warn when trying to import a non-existent tag in `oc import-image`
- Show singular pods in the `oc status` output
- Router
  - Show more information from the router reload command in the router logs
  - Routes that changed at the same time could compete for being exposed if they were in different namespaces.  Made the check for which route gets exposed predictable.
  - Use the health check when restarting the router to ensure the new process is correctly running before continuing
- Better error in the web console when JavaScript is disabled.
- Failed deployments should update the status of the deployment config more rapidly, reducing the time before the old deployment is scaled back up

## API Changes
- `oc rsh` now launches `/bin/sh`, not `/bin/bash`. To have the old behavior, run `oc rsh NAME -- /bin/bash`

## Features

### Upstream components
- Updated Kubernetes to v1.2.0 pre-beta.0 62e574341c8e9c2136b23b8feffadea4c156b284
- Updated etcd to v2.2.5

### Command-line usability
- Add `oc create service account` to make it easier to create a new service account
- Add a new ""oc debug"" command that makes it easy to get a shell in a misbehaving pod - clones the exact environment of the running deployment config, replication controller, or pod, but replaces the run command with a shell.
- Add a command for updating deployment and build config triggers - `oc set trigger`
- Add a command for updating liveness and readiness probes on deployment config - `oc set probe`
- Display more information about liveness and readiness probes in the `oc status` and `oc describe` commands
- Improve `oc describe deploymentconfig/NAME` to show more useful info
- Allow build configuration environment variables to be set with `oc set env bc/NAME`, like deployment configs
- `oc status` will now warn when a build config is missing one or more of the image streams it depends on

### Web Console
- More detailed pod status on all pages
- Better status and alert messages
- Show events on more objects and allow the events table to be filtered and sorted
- Improve Dockerfile build keyword highlighting when editing builds
- Display more accurate information about routes based on which addresses the router exposed them under

### Administration
- Support service accounts on router and registry
  - The router can now be created without specifying `--credentials` and it will use the `router` service account in the current namespace
  - The registry will also use a service account if `--credentials` is not provided.  Otherwise, it will set the values from the `--credentials` file as environment on the generated deployment config.
- Add support for security context constraints in `oc describe`
- Increase the default `HostSubnetLength` value for OpenShift SDN to 9 (allowing 512 nodes by default) and broaden the default `ClusterNetworkCIDR` to `10.128.0.0/14` to allow 512 pods each for those 512 nodes.
- Increase the default `MaxPodsPerNode` setting to 110 to reflect updated capacity.
- Allow extended user attributes to be set by an authenticating proxy
- The diagnostics command has graduated from experimental and now appears as `oadm diagnostics`
- The HAProxy router allows the public HTTP and HTTPS ports it serves on to be overriden
- The FSGroup for the namespace is now enforced and defaulted on all pods created, and the user in the container should be a member of that group.

## Bug fixes
- Fixes to dynamic provisioners to prevent creating multiple volumes for one claim
- Host value should be written to rejected route status by the routers
- Use the correct HOME directory on Windows in the CLI
- Rolling deployments with no surge and a maxUnavailable less than 100% will now preserve at least one pod during a rolling update (if scale is > 1)
- If a node is started and Docker is not available or would likely fail to connect, print more information to help a user debug why.
- Remove invalid flags from `oc`, `oadm`, and `openshift` binary bash tab-completion scripts
- `oc new-app` could fail when Docker environment variables were set but Docker was not available
- Increase binary build timeout from 1 minute to 5 minutes to allow pods to schedule more effectively
- On some Linux kernel versions, HAProxy could lose track of some connections that were pending on its socket while a graceful reload was happening. Setting the `DROP_SYN_DURING_RESTART` environment variable on the HAProxy router to `1` will drop SYN packets while HAProxy is in the process of reloading, ensuring the client retries the connection. Future kernel versions will remove the need for this workaround.
- Rapid router reloads could cause temporary unavailability of some routes - now wait for reload until the new HAProxy process is completely started
- If an image import failed, `oc import-image` would sometimes be unable to reimport another image.
- `oc apply` was broken when passed a `List` of objects, so commands like `oadm registry -o yaml | oc apply -f -` would fail.

## API Changes
- ImageStreamTags now return the spec tag `tag`, the current status `conditions`, and latest status generation `generation`, so clients can get an accurate view of the current tag.
- ImageStreamTags can be updated via PUT to set their spec tag in a single call.
- DeploymentConfig hooks now default the container name if there is only a single container in the deployment config.

## Included projects
- Update to Kubernetes v1.2.0-dev.6 (https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/commit/9caf0a7e729a24ba85533fe9a5e141ab67b8abfc)
- Update to etcd v2.2.4

## Features
- The administrative commands are now exposed via `oc adm` so you have access to them in a client context - `oadm` will still work but will be a symlink to the `oc binary`.
- IPFailover supports a router id offset, supporting multiple ipfailover setups per cluster
- Allow the master to support recursive DNS resolution via a new master config flag `allowRecursiveQueries`, defaults to false
- The userspace node proxy can be enabled on nodes for users who want to continue using it over the iptables proxy via 
  
  ```
  proxyArguments:
    proxy-mode:
    - userspace
  ```
- `oc explain` now works for Origin types - try `oc explain dc.spec.test` 
- The web console will now display more error and warning information about routes, their configuration, and their use in the system
- Routers now report back status to the master about whether routes are accepted, rejected, or conflict with other users. The CLI will now display that error information, allowing users to know that the route isn't being served.
- The SETUID and SETGID capabilities have been added back to the `anyuid` SCC, which ensures that programs that start as root and then drop to a lower permission level will work by default.
- Deployment hooks can now tag the most recent container image into another image stream on success - use a ""test"" deployment to validate the deployment succeeds, and then tag the resulting image into an image stream tag for others to use
- Trigger a user provided command after a build succeeds but before the push - users can set `shell` (to run a shell script), `command`, or `args` to run a command in the working directory of the built image.  All s2i builders set the user's source repo as the working directory, so commands like `bundle exec rake test` should work.
- Administrators can enforce a ratio on pod requests and limits for CPU and memory via the new ClusterResourceOverride for users on the platform.

## Bugs
- Improve the web console's performance when displaying many deployments or builds
- Router unique host check should not reprocess routes that did not change
- Add the AlwaysPull admission controller to prevent users from being able to run images that others have already pulled to the node
- Fix `oc edit` when editing multiple items in a list form
- The recycler for persistent volumes now uses a service account and has proper access to restricted content
- Support the block profiler in pprof
- Handle additional cGroup locations when constraining builds
- Handle scratch images from new-app
- Add support for paged LDAP queries

## Compatibility with previous releases

### API Changes
- Due to a change in the upstream JSON serialization path used in Kubernetes, some fields that were previously accepted case-insensitively are no longer accepted. Please validate that your API objects have the correct case for all attributes
- When creating a deployment config, omitting the `spec.selector` will default that value to the pod template labels

## Features

### Updated to Kubernetes 1.2.0-dev from late January

This release includes an update to be based on Kubernetes 1.2.0 dev https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/commit/9caf0a7e729a24ba85533fe9a5e141ab67b8abfc (thanks @deads2k, @liggitt, and @soltysh)

Highlighted features:
- Addition of `kubectl create namespace` and `kubectl create secrets`, making it easier to create those resources directly.  `oc secrets` will be replaced over time with additions to `oc create secrets`.
- Secrets can now be injected as environment variables using the `secretKeyRef` field making consumption of secrets in applications easier.
- DaemonSets are enabled in Origin now that the API has been stabilized.

We anticipate one more rebase prior to 1.2.0 Origin onto 1.2.0 Kube rc0.

### Updated etcd to v2.2.2

Carries performance improvements.

### Build secrets and image sources
-   Edit build configurations directly from the web console
  ![bc-edit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1163175/12870411/9e35eaa8-cd11-11e5-8dd3-646037581af9.png)
-   Builds can now be supplied with input files from unrelated images.  Previously all input to a build had to come from the builder image itself, or a git repository.  It is now possible to specify additional images and paths within those images to use as an input to a build for things like external dependencies.
  
  Use the `--source-image=IMAGE` and `--source-image-path=SRC:DST` flags to `oc new-build` to specify images.
  
  The example shown below will inject the `/usr/lib/jenkins/jenkins.war` file out of the image currently tagged with `jenkins:latest` into the `installed-apps` directory of the build input.
  
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: BuildConfig
  metadata:
    name: imagedockerbuild
  spec:
    source:
      images:
      - from:
          kind: ImageStreamTag
          name: jenkins:latest
        paths:
        - destinationDir: installed-apps/
          sourcePath: /usr/lib/jenkins/jenkins.war
  ```
  
  Be sure to set an image change trigger for `jenkins:latest` if you want to rebuild every time that image is updated.
-   Builds can now be supplied with secrets for use during the build prcoess.  Previously secrets could be used for git cloning but now secrets can also be made available to the build process itself so that build operations such as maven packaging can use a secret for credentials.
-   Builds now properly use Git submodules when checking out the source repository - thanks to @paralin
-   When a build configuration is deleted (via oc delete), all associated Builds are now deleted as well.  To prevent this behavior, specify --cascade=false.
-   Custom build configurations can now specify the API version to use.  This API version will determine the schema version used for the serialized build configuration supplied to the custom build pod in the BUILD environment variable.
-   Resource limits are now enforced on the container launched by S2I builds, and also on the operations performed within containers as part of a docker build of a Dockerfile.  (Previously the resource limit only applied to the build pod itself and not the containers spawned by the build process)

### Import images with authentication, schedule image import, and image pullthrough
-   You can now import images from Docker v2 registries that are authenticated via Basic or Token credentials. To import, create a secret in your project based on a `.docker/config.json` or `.dockercfg` file:
  
  ```
  $ oc secrets new hub .dockerconfigjson=$HOME/.docker/config.json
  Created secret/hub
  $ oc import-image auth-protected/image-from-dockerhub
  The import completed successfully.
  
  Name:       image-from-dockerhub
  Created:    Less than a second ago
  
  Tag     Spec                                 Created
  latest  default/image-from-dockerhub:latest  Less than a second ago ...
  ```
  
  When importing, all secrets in your project of those types will be checked. To exclude a secret from being a candidate for importing, use the `openshift.io/image.excludeSecret` annotation set to `true`:
  
  ```
  $ oc annotate secret/hub openshift.io/image.excludeSecret=true
  ```
-   Image stream tags can be set to be automatically imported from remote repositories when they change (public or private). OpenShift will periodically query the remote registry and check for updates depending on the configuration the administrator sets. By default, images will be checked every 15 minutes.
  
  To set an image to be imported automatically, used the `--scheduled` flag with the `oc tag` command:
  
  ```
  $ oc tag --source=docker redis:latest myredis:latest --scheduled
  Tag myredis:latest set to import redis:latest periodically.
  ```
  
  You can see which images are being scheduled using `oc describe is myredis`.
  
  Administrators can control whether scheduling is enabled, the polling interval, and the rate at which images can be imported via the `imagePolicyConfig` section in the master configuration.
-   The integrated Docker registry now supports ""image pullthrough"", allowing you to tag a remote image into OpenShift and directly pull it from the integrated registry as if it were already pushed to the OpenShift registry. If the remote registry is configured to use content-offload (sending back a temporary redirect URL to the actual binary contents), that value will be passed through the OpenShift registry and down to the Docker daemon, avoiding the need to proxy the binary contents. 
  
  To try pullthrough, tag an image from the DockerHub and then pull it from the integrated registry:
  
  ```
  $ oc tag --source=docker redis:latest redis:local
  $ oc get is redis

  Status: Downloaded newer image for 127.30.1.5:5000/default/redis:local
  ```
  
  You can use pullthrough with private images - the integrated registry will use the same secret you imported the image with to fetch content from the remote registry.
-   Imported images now contain the size of the image as well as the individual layers and size of each layer and report that in `describe`
-   When importing an entire remote repository, only the first 5 tags will be imported by default.  OpenShift will preferentially import the `latest` tag and the highest semantically versioned tag (tags in the form `v5`, `5.0`, or `5.0.1`). You can import the remaining tags directly. Lists of tags will be sorted with the latest tag on top, followed by the highest major semantic tag, in descending order.

### Integrated Docker registry
-   The integrated registry now supports Azure Blob Storage, OpenStack Swift, and Amazon CloudFront as storage backends
-   A readiness and health check have been added to the integrated registry to ensure new instances do not serve traffic until they are fully initialized.

### Test deployments and improvements to the Recreate strategy
-   It is now possible to create a ""test"" deployment that will scale itself down to zero when a deployment is complete.  This deployment can be used to verify that an image will be correctly rolled out without requiring the pods to be running all the time.  To create a test deployment, use the `--as-test` flag on `oc new-app` or set the `spec.test` field of a deployment config to `true` via `oc edit`.
  
  The deployment will trigger like any other deployment config, scaling up to the current `spec.replicas` value when triggered, and then once the deployment has completed (success or failure) it will be scaled down to zero.  You can use deployment hooks to test or verify the deployment - since hooks run as part of the deployment process, a test suite running in your hook can ensure your application is correct and pass or fail the deployment.  You can add a local database or other test container to the deployment pod template, and have your application code verify itself before passing to the next step.
  
  Scaling a test deployment will only affect the next deployment.
-   The Recreate strategy now supports `mid` hooks which run while all old pods have been scaled down and before any new pods are scaled up - use it to run migrations or config changes that can only happen while the application is completely shut down. 
-   The Recreate strategy now has the same behavior as the Rolling strategy - requiring the pod to be ""ready"" before continuing with the deployment. A new field `timeoutSeconds` was added to the strategy that is the maximum allowed interval between pods becoming ready - it defaults to 120s.

### Web console
- The console theme has been updated and refined.
  ![overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1163175/12870414/b9f58028-cd11-11e5-99e7-a07ef027ec68.png)
- Display limits and quota information in the web console for all resources, including fine grained control on each container![resource-limits](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1163175/12870417/dd8e44fc-cd11-11e5-9596-2afc7d6e5302.png)
- Templates containing Jobs, DaemonSets, HorizontalPodAutoscalers, and other non-core Kubernetes resources can now be instantiated in the web console
- Allow users to hit a customized branded page before continuing on to a login identity provider.  This allows users to see your branding up front instead of immediately redirecting to identity providers like Github and Google.
- Project names and descriptions can be edited from the settings page
- Pod, replication controller, and deployment configuration environment variables are editable
- A new ""About"" page allows administrators to show download client links and provides information about the server.![about](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1163175/12870419/e3614d7a-cd11-11e5-8f6a-568038a1fa1e.png)

### Command line
- Display more information about the application being created in `oc new-app`, including any display name or description set on the image as a label, or whether the image may require running as root.
- If you have set up the `latest` tag in an image stream to point to another tag in the same image stream, the `oc new-app` command will follow that reference and create the application using the referenced tag, not `latest`. This allows administrators to ensure applications are created on stable tags (like `php:5.6`). The default image streams created in the `openshift` project follow this pattern.
- Administrators can pass the `--all-namespaces` flag to `oc status` to see status information across all namespaces (WARNING: this will generate a lot of output!)
- You can view the logs of the oldest pod in a deployment or build config with `oc logs dc/NAME`
- The `oc env` and `oc volume` commands have been moved to `oc set env` and `oc set volume`, and future commands that modify aspects of existing resources will be located under this command.
- Improve the help output of the `oadm policy` command.

### Storage
- The NoDiskConflicts scheduling predicate can be added to the scheduler configuration to ensure that pods using the same Ceph RBD device are not placed on the same node. See the help topic on customizing the scheduler for more information.

### Security
- When a pod is crashlooping, display an error in `oc status` and provide more information about possible causes.
- By default, the `restricted` and `anyuid` security context constraints drop Linux capabilities that could be used to escalate container privileges. Administrators can change the list of default or enforced capabilities.
- Use a constant-time string comparison on web-hooks - thanks @elyscape
- Only users authenticated via OAuth can request projects
- A GitLab server can be used as an identity provider - thanks @fh1ch

### Routes
- Create routes directly via `oc create route edge|passthrough|reencrypt`, allowing you to specify the secret values to be used for the route.
- You can limit the frequency of router reloads using the `--interval=DURATION` flag or `RELOAD_INTERVAL` environment variable to the router. This can minimize the memory and CPU used by the router while reloading, at the cost of delaying when the route is exposed via the router.

### Configuration and Administration
- The set of admission controllers in use may be configured by an administrator in the master configuration.
- `openshift ex diagnostics` can now launch a diagnostic pod that reports on more potential issues with pod networking, DNS configuration, and registry authentication
- The amount of projects an individual user can create can be limited via the ProjectRequestQuota admission controller
- A build defaults admission controller can be used to set default environment variables on all builds created, including proxy settings.

## Bugs fixed
- Passthrough routes may not be specified with paths - since passthrough does not decode the route there is no way for the router to check the path without decoding the request. `oc status` will now warn you if you have any such routes.
- `oc new-app` now returns more information about errors encountered while searching for matches to user input
- When using images from registries that are not the DockerHub, don't insert the `library` prefix.
- The image ID returned from the ImageStreamImage API was not the correct value.
- The router health check was not correct on all systems when using host networking - it now defaults to using `localhost`
- OAuth client secrets are not reset in HA master configurations

### API Changes
- Allow deleting a tag via `DELETE /oapi/v1/namespaces/NAMESPACE/imagestreamtags/STREAM:TAG`
- It is no longer valid to set route TLS configuration without also specifying a termination type.  A default has been set for type to be `terminate` if the user provided TLS certificates
- Docker builds can now be configured with custom Dockerfile paths

### Dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes

Dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes was implemented for AWS, GCE, and OpenStack, with 1 provisioner per cloud provider.  PersistentVolumes of those types can be made on-the-fly in response to a PersistentVolumeClaim with a specific annotation (""volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class"").  This feature is experimental and may change in future releases.  Having multiple provisioners at once is not currently supported.

### Web Console
- Allow build config environment variables to be edited from the web console
- Show build trends on the build config overview page
- Individual build configs and deployments can be deleted
- Allow any object in the web console to be edited like `oc edit` with a direct YAML editor, for when you need to tweak rarely used fields
- Improve the experience around web console scaling with more information
- Show empty replication controllers in the overview when they are not part of a service
- Users can dismiss web console alerts

### Command line
- `oc status` now shows suggestions and warnings about conditions it detects in the current project
- `oc start-build` now allows environment and log-level to be passed as arguments
- `oc secret` allows custom secret types to be created
  - Accept the new dockercfg format in the `oc secrets` commands
- `oc new-build` now supports the `--to` flag, which allows you to specify which image stream tag you want to push a build to.  You can pass `--to-docker` to push to an external image registry.  If you only want to test the build, pass `--no-output` which will just ensure the build passes.
- Support some of the global rsync flags on `oc rsync` for displaying progress information - not supported on all rsync backends (like tar)

### Security
- The user name of the person requesting a project be created is now available to parameterize the initial project template as the parameter `PROJECT_REQUESTING_USER`
- When creating a new application from a Docker image, warn if the image does not specify a user that administrators may have disabled running as root inside of containers.
- Add a new role `system:image-pusher` that allows pushing images to the integrated registry.
- Deleting a cluster role from the command line will now delete all role bindings associated to that role unless you pass `--cascade=false`
- Deleting users and groups cascades to delete their role bindings across the cluster.
- Run the Docker registry as a non-root user

### Misc features
- Update to the 2.2.1 version of the Docker registry
- Use the new iptables kube-proxier instead of the userspace proxier for a big improvement in speed and reduction in CPU
- Promote the LDAP group prune and sync commands out of experimental into `oadm groups`
- More tests and config warnings in `openshift ex diagnostics`
- Builds are updated with the Git commit used in a build after the build completes.
- Routers now support overriding the host value in a route at startup - you can start multiple routers and serve the same route over different wildcards (with different configurations).  See the help for `openshift-router`

### Bug fixes
- Remove deployer pods when pruning failed deployments
- Various improvements to tab-autocompletion scripts on the command line
  - Fix autocompletion of build config names
  - Fix autocompletion of flags used by all commands
- When filewalld is restarted, reload proxy rules
- Give router instances a readiness check and update their liveness check to always use /healthz (which is now exposed)
- Do not export service account secrets that can't be used in other environments (service account tokens are namespace specific)
- Allow the streaming connection timeout in the kubelet to be configured via kubelet extended parameters, instead of being hardcoded
- Validate the remote repository to be cloned in builds using `git ls-remote` which is more accurate when using certain Git clone specs
- When using source code authentication in builds, if the password exceeds 255 characters (which is not supported by Git correctly) we now use a local proxy
- `oc start-build --from-webhook` could fail when not passing Git info
- On Windows, `oc` now uses the correct home directory for its operations
- The Jenkins template no longer identifies Jenkins as a DB
- When generating applications using `new-app` or builds with `new-build`, prevent accidental circular references (don't push the build output to the same tag that is used as the input to the build)
- Make `oc env` more tolerant of the background status updates the node generates (less conflict failures from the CLI)
- Improve deployment scaling behavior by making `oc scale dc/foo` more reliable and predictable.
- When running `oc new-app`, allow the local Docker daemon to be contacted over TLS if the user has specified the normal Docker client environment variables.
- Websocket watches were not being closed cleanly, resulting in hangs on some browsers
- DNS in the cluster is now served via the kube-proxy on the Kubernetes master port 53, which ensures that in an HA setup DNS continues to respond.
- systemd start notifications were not properly being delivered in some cases, resulting in services being restarted
- `oc expose` is updated to work with services that use port names (instead of numbers) when creating routes
- Importing of Docker images into image streams now correctly works when using a proxy via `HTTPS_PROXY`
- In a clustered etcd deployment, wait for access tokens to propagate to all cluster members before returning the token to the user
- Setting a node IP in the Kubelet config no longer overrides the node hostname.

- Fix volume recycler image to run as a service account and properly handle different permission sets
- Add `openshift/origin-node` image, which can be used for containerized installs
- Deployer pod runs as a non-root user, making it easier to run under alternate security policies
- Show deployment status (failed or cancelled) in the web console next to the deployment

We recommend users running 1.0.7 upgrade to 1.0.8 due to several significant performance issues.

### Major fixes
- #5774 Preserve very large integers when serializing and deserializing JSON - resulted in hangs on the server
- #5778 When running a containerized node, the ca.crt passed into the container is wrong
- #5720 Deleting projects could encounter significant slow downs due repeated invocations
- #5722 The `oc` command should automatically use the service account when used inside a container
- #5706 Deployment config can indefinitely accumulate error messages, leading to failures in deployment config updates and significant CPU use
- #5737 Significant CPU slowdown when creating new projects
- #5537 Better support viewing very large logs in the UI
- #5581 Update cAdvisor version, fixing a memory leak and Docker connection leak on the node
- #5585 Use of rsh and exec on could occasionally timeout due to unfair frame handling in SPDY
- #5613 DNS name resolution of services was triggering multiple false timeouts due to recursion - names should now resolve in a few milliseconds.

### Features
- It is now possible to order security context constraints via the priority field, which applies pod security defaults from the highest priority group first. This allows cluster administrators to run pods as root by default.  To restore the prior security behavior, set a higher priority on the SCC you wish to apply defaults.
- Supplemental groups for filesystem access are allocated per project, and access to shared filesystems can be controlled via the supplemental group on Docker 1.8 or later
- Build logs and deployment logs now supported via `oc log dc/NAME` and `oc log build/NAME`, with all log options on those types also supported
- When running hooks from a deployment, display the hook logs as part of the deployment pod logs

### Fixes
- Kubelet reacts much faster to status changes in pods and communicates important status changes to the master more effectively
- Disable TCP keep-alive on liveness probes, which was causing false negatives on liveness because of Go's connection pooling
- Attaching to a pod with only stdin should terminate the attach when stdin is closed, not when the pod exits (fixed in go-dockerclient)
- Better error output when Gluster and iSCSI volumes cannot be mounted
- `horizontalpodautoscaler` and `job` resources are now available in the `extensions/v1beta1` API, with policy that allows end users to access them
- Deleting pods that have the phase `failed` or `succeeded` should complete immediately, rather than waiting for the Kubelet to acknowledge the delete
- `oc import-image` should not require the image stream to have `dockerImageRepository` set, now that individual spec tags can reference different Docker image repositories
- Update documentation to properly identify `all_squash` as NOT being necessary when using NFS persistent volumes
- It should be possible to specify the amount of lines of a pod log to tail while also following the log
- Username taken from a build secret should override a username in the source URL
- Ensure service node ports are properly released when deleted
- When upgrading the master before nodes are upgraded, ensure the master handles graceful deletion for those old nodes
- Some timeouts in the kube proxy were too short, and have been lengthened to better handle failures failing over backends
- `/etc/hosts` is now managed by the Kubelet instead of Docker, to ensure that all search domains and name servers are properly resolved
- Mirror pods can now be logged
- It is possible to serialize image pulls on the node by setting a config value - this bypasses issues encountered in Docker 1.8 with simultaneous pulls
- Memory allocation in the apiserver is much reduced during normal operation
- Set context directory properly in the `new-app` and `new-build` commands when specifying source code using the `~` operator

This is the first release candidate for Origin 1.1 and OSE 3.1.  Please see the migration notes and API changes when updating a live cluster.

![new-overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/10799234/26284eae-7d82-11e5-92e3-16075f638957.png)

### Migrating from 1.0.x
- Cluster roles have changed - please run:
  
  ```
  $ oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
  $ oadm policy reconcile-cluster-role-bindings
  ```
  
  to review the changes, and pass `--confirm` to accept those changes.
- `v1beta3` is no longer supported as a storage version or API version
  - If you are using `v1beta3` as your Kubernetes or OpenShift storage version, you will receive an error when you try to restart the OpenShift masters because `v1beta3` is no longer a valid storage version. You must update the values of `etcdStorageConfig.kubernetesStorageVersion` and `etcdStorageConfig.openShiftStorageVersion` to be `v1` in your `master-config.yaml` file.
  - You may also need to change the `apiLevels` field to remove references to `v1beta3`.

### API Changes
- `v1beta3` is no longer supported as an API endpoint (`/api/v1beta3` and `/osapi/v1beta3` are now disabled). 
  - The CLI and golang client libraries can still convert `v1beta3` objects to `v1` via 
    
    ```
    $ oc export --raw --api-version=v1 -f FILENAME -o yaml
    ```
- The value of the `status.dockerImageRepository` for an `ImageStream` now returns either the fully qualified pull spec for the stream on the integrated registry (if configured), or the value of `spec.dockerImageRepository` if no integrated registry has been set. The previous behavior was to use `spec.dockerImageRepository` if it was set, overriding the internal location, but that made it difficult for clients to generate a URL that allowed them to push to the image stream.
- Builds marked only with the `build` label will no longer be considered part of their parent build config. You can see a list of affected builds by running `oc get builds --all-namespaces` and looking for builds that only have the `build` label, not `openshift.io/build`. See #3502.
- The `spec.rollingParams.updatePercent` field on deployment configs will no longer be recognized.  Use `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` instead.
- Images can be edited to set fields like `labels` or `annotations`
- Routes can now specify which port they wish to route to - by default, all callers that might point to multi-port services should set `spec.port.targetPort` to the port on the Pod (or external service) to target.
- Builds now contain `status.outputDockerImageReference` which is the Docker location that the image will be pushed to.
- Image streams now return the integrated registry's Docker spec in `status.dockerImageRepository` instead of showing the value of `spec.dockerImageRepository`. If no integrated registry is included, the value from spec will be used if set.
- Logging and remote execution can now be performed over WebSockets for use from a browser client or languages without a SPDY library

### Features
- Updated to Kubernetes `v1.2.0-1107-g4c8e6f4`
  - **Job** resources are now available in the `extensions` API group for managing tasks that must run to completion
  - **HorizontalPodAutoscalers** allow deployment configs and replication controllers to be autoscaled based on their load
- LDAP group synchronization added under `oadm group-sync` for enforcing group membership from external LDAP directories
- Nodes
  - Switch CPU quota to CFS by default, which enforces maximum CPU usage per container
  - Out of memory conditions are the node are now controlled by the node agent, with OOMScoreAdjust and Restart policy set to ensure the node remains stable in overcommitted scenarios
- Deployment hooks may now leverage volumes from the original pod
- Add `oc rsync`, which can copy local directories into a remote pod. If rsync is not available in the pod or on the client, the command will fall back to a direct copy:
  
  oc rsync ~/myfolder <pod>:/home/user/test
- Pods may join the host PID or host IPC namespaces if they are granted appropriate access

### Multi-tenant pod networks

The multi-tenant SDN plugin can be used to isolate projects from each other.  Each project is isolated, and administrators can bind projects together with `oadm pod-network join-project` or expose the pods within a project to all other projects.

To enable the multi-tenant SDN plugin, in `node-config.yaml` change `networkConfig.networkPluginName` to `redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant`.

### Logs
- Additional filtering options are available on `oc log` - controlling the amount of logs displayed, show timestamps, view contents from a historical time (relative or by date)
- The web console will show logs for pods and builds, allowing you to view the current or previous container's state
  ![logs_screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/10799163/bba0ef28-7d81-11e5-9871-c28b268a46b5.png)

### Metrics
- The Kubelet now exposes statistics from cAdvisor securely via cluster permissions to view metrics
- The web console will now display metrics from pods when metrics integration has been enabled
  ![memory-limit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/10799185/d90e1f90-7d81-11e5-9b75-bedede6b8a04.png)

### Web Console
- Totally revamped and extended resource information available in the web console
  ![deployment-config](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/10799270/5248219e-7d82-11e5-830c-45c027ea5df8.png)
- Connect to a container via a remote shell in the web console
  ![shell](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/10799209/f99a23da-7d81-11e5-8704-49b6dcef6db0.png)
- Scale deployments up and down from the web console

- Added the topology view to the web console - see a graph of all your resources
  ![topology](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/10799240/2bd7296a-7d82-11e5-9e25-39fd44568f20.png)
- Improve the layout and organization of the application create page
  ![create_layout](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/10799608/0c96266c-7d84-11e5-82e6-90b4672178bc.png)
- After creating a new application, display more information about next steps
  ![next-steps](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1467629/10799412/161947d8-7d83-11e5-8680-8a83340d0621.png)
- Routes are displayed on the services list page with more info about security and paths available on their own pages
- Pod resource limits and requested amounts are displayed on their respective objects

### Command-line
- Big improvements to `oc new-app` and `oc new-build` to display more information about what is happening when we generate apps:
  
  ```
  $ oc new-app php
  --> Found image dbaa6b2 (33 hours old) in image stream ""php"" under tag :latest for ""php""
      * We will deploy this image in deployment config ""php""
      * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service ""php""
  --> Creating resources with label app=php ...
      DeploymentConfig ""php"" created
      Service ""php"" created
  --> Success
      Run 'oc status' to view your app.
  ```
- Improve Bash completions to better guide user input that is file based
- Revamp the output that is displayed for deployments in `oc get` and `oc describe`
- Add commands to validate node and master configuration - `openshift ex validate master-config` and `openshift ex validate node-config`
- Delete tags from an image stream with `oc tag TAG -d`
- When tagging one image stream tag into another, use the resolved image in the destination, and allow a reference to be created with `--alias`
- On Windows, `oc edit` should no longer report file edit errors, and the edit output is now generated with Windows CR/LF line endings for proper display.
- Support for installation of images via `oc new-app` - images that have the Docker label `io.openshift.generate.job=true` will prompt the user to install themselves.

### Builds
- The contents of a Dockerfile can be directly provided to a Docker build
  - Specify Dockerfile contents on `oc new-build` via the `-D` flag, for example `oc new-build -D $""FROM centos:7\nRUN yum install -y httpd""`
  - In a `Build` API object, set `spec.source.dockerfile` to the desired string value.
  - The value of the Dockerfile will override a Dockerfile in the source Git repository if one is provided
- A binary build can be triggered by passing a file, directory, or local Git repository path to the `oc start-build` command with `--from-file`, `--from-dir`, or `--from-repo`. The contents will be streamed to the builder and used as the input to the build instead of the current Git repository source. Note that a binary build cannot be rebuilt, since the server does not have access to the previous binary sent. Newly triggered builds will use the Git source if available.
- Support SSH keys and basic authentication when pulling Git repositories during builds.
- Environment variables defined in a Docker build are now added to the Dockerfile prior to building
- When a build fails, information about that failure is recorded with the build and displayed in the CLI and UI
- Build logs can now be displayed via `oc logs build/<buildname>` and `oc logs bc/<buildconfig name>`

### Router
- Send `X-Forwarded-*` headers as per RFC7239 on proxied HTTP and HTTPS requests to backends
- Fixed a bug where router stats were not properly enabled when the router was installed
- Display the HAProxy statistics page by default
- Support partition paths in the F5 router
- Display a 503 error page on missing backends in the HAProxy router, which can be customized by layering over the image.
- Disable known insecure TLS cipher suites by default, using the Mozilla intermediate security suite by default, and provide examples for modern and legacy browser support.

### Volumes
- Supplemental groups for use with volumes are now allocated to each project, matching the range of UIDs. Volumes in a pod will be set to be owned by the first group in the range.
- Ensure that volumes are assigned the pod SELinux context on startup

### Security
- If no certificate CA is set on the server, use the system root CAs
- Support multiple server certificates on the master via SNI
- Allow different identity mapper strategies for assigning user names to logged in users, giving more control to administrators
- Add Keystone as an identity provider
- Disable known insecure TLS cipher suites in the master and other HTTPS servers. An environment variable may be specified to enable older cipher suites.

### Fixes
- Cluster role checks are now available in `openshift ex diagnostics`
- Retry deployment actions from the CLI when the deployment process simultaneously updates the deployment config
- Improve output of `deploy --cancel` to be clearer about what has been canceled
- Fix potential race conditions in node SDN setup
- The PATCH operation was not allowed by policy - allow policy roles to allow it
- The version of a server is exposed in the Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint, making it easier to know what versions are in a deployment
- When using `kubectl` compatibility mode (via `openshift kube` or symlinking `kubectl` to `oc`), accept `--kubeconfig` for compatibility with upstream
- Improve cluster stability and performance by increasing overly aggressive resync intervals for the node proxy.

1803090,2015-09-13T20:31:53Z,2015-09-13T21:34:27Z,v1.0.6,"**UPDATE**: Added a v1.0.6 binary for linux/386.  Has not been tested, please report any issues.

### Migrating from 1.0.x
- Origin v1.0.6 recommends the use of Docker v1.7.2+ due to bugs in `docker exec` that can result in hangs.
- Cluster roles have changed - please run `oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles --confirm` after you upgrade if you see an error like `OpenShift client error: User ""system:serviceaccount:test:builder"" cannot create localsubjectaccessreviews in project ""test""`

### API Changes
- The `Template` parameters now support `displayName` which is an optional field to use from user interfaces when your template is shown
- Secrets can now be added to custom builds and mounted at user-specified locations

#### Pending removal
- Support for v1beta3 from the API and from client commands will be removed in 1.0.7 (1.1 rc0)
- Builds marked only with the `build` label will no longer be considered part of their parent build config in 1.0.7. You can see a list of affected builds by running `oc get builds --all-namespaces` and looking for builds that only have the `build` label, not `openshift.io/build`. See #3502.
- The `spec.rollingParams.updatePercent` field on deployment configs will no longer be recognized in 1.0.7.  Use `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` instead.

### Routing
- The default hostname for a route has been changed to be `<route-name>-<namespace>.<suffix>` - this allows TLS wildcards on `<suffix>` to properly work
- A new F5 BigIP router plugin has been added, allowing F5 routers to be dynamically configured. Documentation coming soon!
- The router can be configured to serve a subset of the routes in your deployment
  - Pass `--namespace` to the router command to select routes in a single namespace
  - Pass `--labels=<selector>` or `--fields=<selector>` to select only routes with the provided labels or fields
  - Pass `--project-labels=*` to show routes in all labels the router's service account is granted access to, `--project-labels=<selector>` to filter that list by label, or `--namespace-labels=<selector>` to filter all labels (when the router service account has that permission)
    - Note: the label list is updated every 10 minutes or when the router restarts, so new projects may not instantly get served
- Both the F5 and template routers now allow only the first route (by creation timestamp) with a given `host` or generated host (when you omit the Host field) to claim that route name.  If multiple routes with the same host but different `path`s are defined, all routes in the same namespace as the oldest route with that `host` will be included. If the oldest route is deleted, and the next oldest route is in a different namespace, only routes in that other namespace will be served.

### Builds
- `oc start-build --commit=<commit>` will trigger a build of the exact Git commit specified.
- Add `--env` var support to `oc new-build`, allowing you to set environment variables on your S2I builds.
- Add `--wait` to `oc start-build`, allowing you to wait for the build completion without viewing the logs.

### Remote execution
-   `oc rsh` now accepts commands and arguments after the pod is specified, like
  
  ```
  oc rsh <pod> <command> [<arguments>]
  ```
  
  The behavior more closely mimics the `ssh` command. A TTY is automatically allocated if your current shell passes one, otherwise you can specify `-t` to force a TTY or `-T` to disable it.
- A number of stability and hangs have been resolved with `oc exec` and `oc rsh`. However, Docker 1.6.2 has a known issue with hangs to remote shells via `docker exec`, so we recommend upgrading your Docker to a 1.7 or 1.8 build.

### Web Console
- Deploy, rollback, retry, and cancel deployments from the web console
- Cancel running builds from the web console
- Improvements to layout and readability at mobile resolutions
- Allow the login page to be customized

### Fixes
- Upgraded the integrated etcd to v2.1.2
- Upgraded the internal Docker registry v2.0.1
- Fixed hangs when using `oc exec` without a TTY
- Node IP can be passed as a config option on the node, allowing it to be set distinct from the node hostname for listening on other interfaces
- Add the Kubernetes master service address (the first address in the service CIDR range) to the generated certificates to allow pods to verify TLS connections to the API
- Preserve permissions during image builds
- Recover panics in the API server instead of allowing the server to crash
- Make the OpenShift SDN MTU configurable
- Fix a panic in `oc import-image` when an error occurs
- Suggest `--search` and `--list` when calling `oc new-app` with no arguments
- When running `oc scale` against a deployment config with no deployments, set the replicas directly

1720929,2015-08-24T22:10:04Z,2015-08-25T19:14:58Z,v1.0.5,"## API Changes
- If a deployment config is created without specifying the `triggers` field, the deployment will default to having a `ConfigChange` trigger.
- A new field `subjects` (a list of object references) is available when creating role bindings. You may pass object references to `User`, `SystemUser`, `Group`, `SystemGroup`, or `ServiceAccount` when defining the binding. Passing a reference to a service account will resolve the correct name, making it easier to grant access to service accounts in the current namespace. If `users` or `groups` are also specified, they will take priority over values set in `subjects`

## Features

#### Security
- Secrets were previously limited to only being available in pods when the service account referenced them. To make it easier to use secrets in templates, this is now disabled by default. Administrators can set a config variable to force this for the whole platform, and in a project you can set the ""kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets"" annotation to ""true"" on a particular serivce account to require that check.

#### High Availability
- Master processes can now be started separately as API server and controllers via `openshift start master api` and `openshift start master controllers`. Added support for controller leader election - set `controllerLeaseTTL` to a value between 10 and 300 seconds to control the expiration of a lease (a good default is 30 or 60s).  When controllers lose their lease they will exit and expect to be restarted by a process manager.

#### Platform
- Added support for groups of users. Introduced `oc groups` command to manage them.
- Service accounts are more easily bound to roles through the new `subjects` field (described in API Changes above)

#### Networking/Routing
- Added multitenant SDN support to isolate pods based on which project they belong to.
- Added --host-network flag to openshift router command to allow router to run with container network stack (when set to false)

#### Images
- Importing and pulling from V2 registries is now supported. 
- The import-image command can now create image streams with the --from flag specifying the repo you want to import.
- When you tag an image with 'oc tag' into an image stream that does not exist, an image stream can now be automatically created.

#### Storage
- The volume command now lists by default, and shows you additional information about each volume type.  
  - Persistent volume claims show whether they are provisioned or not, their size, and details about their bound persistent volume. The volume command can also create a new persistent volume claim for you if you specify --claim-size=<size in bytes>
- Added support for CephFS volumes

#### CLI
- Added a `--list` flag to `oc new-app` to display list of available images and templates
- Added `--short` or `-q` flag to `oc project` command to only display project name

#### Builds
- Custom builds now allow a forcePull flag to indicate that the custom builder image must be pulled.
- Multiple image change triggers are now allowed in BuildConfigs

#### Templates
- Added `required` attribute to template parameters. Templates now cannot be instantiated without supplying a value for all required parameters.

## Fixes

#### Platform
- Projects can now be updated using `oc edit` - project admins can change display name and description.

#### Web Console
- Updated the set of labels generated when creating a new app from source just as in the CLI.
- Improved display of builds in web console.

#### Builds
- Builds in which a pod is not created are no longer marked as successful.
- Prevent starting S2I builds that may run as root based on security context constraints on the builder service account.
- Prevent remote shell access to builder containers.

#### CLI
- Builds are now listed according to creation timestamp
- Builds from new-app are started immediately with ConfigChange trigger
- Fixed help text  for `oc get projects`

#### Networking/Routing
- Trigger SDN node event when node ip changes
- Rolling update strategy is used for router deploy
- Added mode http to HA proxy frontend SNI definition

- To make it easier to upgrade, the `oadm reconcile-cluster-roles` command has been added to update your cluster roles to match the internal default. Use this command to verify the cluster infrastructure users have the appropriate permissions.

Features:
- Split the `oc` binary from the OpenShift binary - now much smaller (40m!)
- Display the current version on startup of the master, cleanup some startup logging
- Rolling updates can now be done by percentage - you can specify the percentage of pods to update by a negative or positive amount that adjusts the amount of replicas in chunks.  If negative, old deployments will be scaled down first - if positive, extra pods are created first. The rolling update will work to keep the desired amount of pods running (100% of the old deployment size when a positive percentage, or 100%-UpdatePercent when negative) as it goes
- Even more information available in `oc status` - make it easier to see the types of resources that are being represented by the output
- Search for images, templates, and other inputs for `oc new-app` with the `--search` and `--list` flags. To find out what is available, run:
  
  ```
  $ oc new-app --search php
  ```
  
  which will show you all of the images or templates that include PHP
- `oc new-app` will now always add an `app=<name>` label on the created resources when you don't specify labels with `--labels`. The name is inferred from `--name`, or the name of the first component passed to the command (for instance, `oc new-app php` will add a label `app=php` to all of the resources it creates). You can then easily delete all of those components using `oc delete all -l app=php`.
- The ability to use host ports and the `hostNetwork` option is now properly secured by security context constraints, and only restricted or higher users can use them.
- The `RunAsNonRoot` option for pod security constraints has been added - it is now possible to restrict users to running pods that are non-root (have an explicit USER numeric value set in their Docker image, or have specified the user id on their pod security context)
- Add an `oc rsh POD` command that is a shortcut for `oc exec -itp POD -- bash` to make it easier to get a remote shell into your pods.

Fixes:
- Routes should default to using the route name when creating a virtual host, not the service name
- The `oc expose` command should not default to creating routes except when a service is exposed
- More detail shown on image streams page in the web console
- Display source code revision info in the build describe output
- Display TLS termination output in route describe output
- Allow image import to work with registries that don't implement the whole Docker Registry API (Pulp read only registries)
- Deployment configs should trigger deployment when the `metadata` field of the pod template is changed, not just when the `spec` is changed.
- When using `oc new-app --name=foo`, the `--name` argument should also change the name of the image stream
- The project request template should allow Kubernetes resources as well as OpenShift resources
- Allow `oc volume` to change the volume type when the mount-path is unambiguous
- Builds now properly cancel when the user requests them, rather than running to completion.
- Master startup no longer has a chance to generate certs with duplicate serial numbers (rendering them unusable)
- `oc new-app` will now properly set the labels passed with `--labels` onto the pod template and selector for the deployment
- `oc export` should no longer fail when exporting image streams that have no tags under their `spec`

1561681,2015-07-20T18:52:55Z,2015-07-20T20:38:39Z,v1.0.3,"Backwards compatibility:
- Stored objects
  - Build pods previously inherited the labels of the build. This resulted in pods from builds being accidentally being included in deployments that had similar labels. It was never intended that build pods should share labels with existing components, so this behavior has been removed. Queries that attempt to retrieve build pods by label will no longer work
- API
  - The `pods/exec` endpoint is being moved to `POST` instead of `GET`. For backwards compatibility, `GET` continues to be supported. Clients will try to use `POST`, and if that fails, will try to use `GET`. If you have an existing deployment, the default policy will need to be updated prior to 1.1.0. See #3717 for more.
  - The `hostDir` volume type has been renamed `hostPath` in all Pods and PodTemplates.

Fixes:
- Updated to Kubernetes v1.0.0
- `oc status` now displays standalone replication controllers and a number of other warnings about issues
- `openshift start --print-ip` which reports the IP that the master will use if no --master address is provided
- Fixed a race condition when certificates were created on startup (duplicate serial)
- The timeout for `exec`, `portforward` and `log` sessions has been increased from 5 minutes to 1 hour.
- Improved performance of OpenShift when idling by removing an inefficient timer loop

  - Service
    - The `portalIP` field changed to `clusterIP`. OpenShift will continue to accept and output both fields - `clusterIP` takes precedence
  - The protocol for a port under a Service, Endpoint, or Container must be uppercased - `TCP` instead of `tcp`, and `UDP` instead of `udp`. OpenShift will continue to accept all case variations

Features
- A new [LDAP identity provider](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/configuring_authentication.html#LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider) has been added, allowing you to configure OpenShift to verify passwords and users against an LDAP server directly
- The master's CA cert can be made available as a secret inside pods, making it easier to manage secure TLS inside the cluster. To enable this in an existing configuration, set the `masterCA` field in the [master configuration file](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/service_accounts.html#enable-service-account-authentication).

Fixes
- Upgrade to Kubernetes v0.22
- Cleanup and improvements to the browse pages in the web console, better layout at smaller resolutions, and lots of little cleanup
- Avoid writing excessive log errors on initial deployments when the image is not yet available
- Router and registry should default to using the RollingUpdate strategy deployment
  - We recommend you update any existing router or registry installations if you plan on scaling them up to multiple pods
- Support quay.io registries by using cookies when importing images
- Lots of improvements to `oc status` to display warnings when problems are detected
- Docker images of the form `[registry]/[name]` are now properly handled by `oc new-app` and the image import functionality

#### Deploy
- A simple and easy ramp up experience - **run OpenShift as a container** and try it out before deploying multiple nodes, then use the [Ansible installer](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible) to spin up a full cluster.
- Run and **deploy any application built out of Docker images**; set up automated or manual rolling deployments with **integrated canary testing**; or run your own custom deployment workflows inside your own containers
- A set of reusable [building block images](http://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/overview.html) for **all the major development platforms** that leverage [best practices](http://docs.openshift.org/latest/creating_images/guidelines.html) for running in a cloud environment
- Integrate with the Kubernetes runtime environment and use health checks, persistent network attached volumes, service discovery, integrated DNS, and a **resilient host infrastructure** to keep your containers running.
- Benefit from **easy container networking** by leveraging our integrated software defined networking setup, or use your existing network infrastructure

#### Develop
- Easily **build and rebuild** images using Docker or [Source-to-Image](http://docs.openshift.org/latest/creating_images/sti.html) builds; chain builds together to automatically occur, manage the flow of images from dev to test to production, and integrate external CI systems into your deployment workflows.
- Painless web serving with our **integrated router** plugins for HAProxy and F5 - one click and your application has a publicly visible DNS name.
- Create **reusable application building blocks** out of templates that can be deployed to many environments and publish those templates for others to use, or integrate with a config management system

#### Manage
- Use the `oc` command line or our integrated Web console to **create and manage your applications** on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- **Secure your environment from end to end** with private source builds and image security, fully encrypted server to server communication, easy user integration with external systems, and a customizable policy engine and service accounts for controlling how applications talk to each other.
- As an administrator, create projects and assign flexible security policies and resource usage controls to the teams in your organization.  Ensure containers **run in secure sandboxes** on your cluster or relax those restrictions for specific teams to run high privilege containers.

- Configuration of the OpenShift master and nodes can now be read from disk - see --write-config on `openshift start` and the `create-*` commands under `openshift admin`
- Initial support for the v2 Docker registry has been added - OpenShift can now boot a v2 registry to serve image pulls by Id.  Still waiting on Docker 1.6 to force everyone over to this new model.
- Improvements and cleanup to `osc login` and `osc project` to make them faster
- DNS support for services
  - All services now get a DNS name from the masters of `<servicename>.<namespace>.local`
  - The A record for each service is the service PortalIP
  - Subdomain queries on the service name also resolve as A records.
- Builds
  - Better build log handling
  - Include the start and end times for build
- Added NodeJS cartridge

- `openshift ex new-project` allows you to easily create a project and assign an administrator
- `openshift ex router` makes it easy to install a new default router or additional routers as services
- Templates can now be stored / retrieved / viewed from the server, for others to consume
  - `osc create -f examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json` will now upload the template to the server
  - `osc describe template sample-app` will show details of that template

- A ""contextDir"" can now be set during STI builds if you want to build from a location in your source repository that is not the root
- Quota and limit support has been enabled, but is not yet enforced
- The console more cleanly supports the complex edge cases and behaviors around services and deployments and pods and how they can overlap or fit together with label selection

NOTE: There are some known performance optimizations still to be made in the policy / project / access engine, so high GC and CPU use when projects are added or dropped is expected.  Total memory usage should not be affected.

- Revised and cleaned up the OpenShift CLI help to make it easier to read
- OpenShift now supports running on top of an existing Kubernetes
  - The OpenShift Master can run in a pod and connect to Kubernetes via the `--kubernetes=<addr>` and `--kubeconfig=<file>` arguments
  - The `/api` endpoint on the master will apply access control rules based on your policy and then proxy you to the Kubernetes master, meaning that OpenShift can control access to the cluster
- Authorization for individual users can be controlled via the `openshift ex policy` commands, which allow you to create policies that limit access to cluster resources by role to cluster resources.
- You can run `openshift ex login` to authenticate to the cluster and set an access token into your local `.kubeconfig` file

Changes since 0.2.1:
- The master automatically applies the current release version tag (from the build that generated the binary) to the docker images used for deployers, builders, and other automatically used images.
  - The default image format is `openshift/origin-deployer:${version}`, and can be changed to pull images via another naming scheme through the `--images` tag on `openshift start`.
  - The flag `--latest-images` will substitute `latest` for `${version}` instead of the most recent tag.
- Authentication and authorization policies are now in place, although not enforced.  See the documentation for more
- You can run OpenShift against an existing Kubernetes cluster by specifying the `--kubernetes=<addr>` and `--kubeconfig=<path>` flags - the kubeconfig controls how you authenticate to the cluster.  
  - OpenShift will start a proxy at `/api/` that checks authorization against OpenShift, and then proxies requests to the cluster.
  - This is still an experimental feature
- `openshift kube` now matches the upstream `kubectl` command, and will expose all of the options from upstream and works on OpenShift resources.
  - kubeconfig is respected for both the osc and kubectl commands - see `openshift ex config` to manipulate it
- `osc rollback` will allow you to rollback to a previous version of a deployment config (create a new deployment using previous settings)
