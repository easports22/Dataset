6523695,2017-05-27T15:02:45Z,2017-05-27T15:18:52Z,2.0.0,"- LogAdapter functionality is changed. Log adapter decides when to log with `isLoggable` and how to log with format strategy. You can create your custom adapter and add to Logger. Logger now accepts multiple log adapters.

- Initialization changed. Old style is not supported any longer. Use the following style with log adapters. This approach allows you to add multiple adapters and each adapter contains different logic.
```java
Logger.addLogAdapter(new AndroidLogAdapter());
```

- FormatStrategy added. With format strategy, you can have different output format such as normal pretty look or csv. You can also add your custom format.

- Settings is removed. Format settings are associated with format strategy. Use the built-in functions to change the appearance or behavior.
```java
FormatStrategy formatStrategy = PrettyFormatStrategy.newBuilder()
  .showThreadInfo(false)  // (Optional) Whether to show thread info or not. Default true
  .methodCount(0)         // (Optional) How many method line to show. Default 2
  .methodOffset(7)        // (Optional) Hides internal method calls up to offset. Default 5
  .logStrategy(customLog) // (Optional) Changes the log strategy to print out. Default LogCat
  .tag(""My custom tag"")   // (Optional) Custom tag for each log. Default PRETTY_LOGGER
  .build();

Logger.addLogAdapter(new AndroidLogAdapter(formatStrategy));
```

- LogStrategy added. Log stratey decides what to do with the input, for example: print out to logcat or save it to file. You can create your custom log strategy as well.

- LogLevel removed. There are many different ways when it comes to what to log and when to log. Therefore decision is now up to the developer. Log adapters contain `isLoggable` function. Simply override it and put your log condition.
```java
Logger.addLogAdapter(new AndroidLogAdapter(){
  @Override public boolean isLoggable(int priority, String tag) {
    return BuildConfig.DEBUG;
  }
});
```

- DiskLogAdapter added. Save output to file, CSV format is supported. 
```java
Logger.addLogAdapter(new DiskLogAdapter());
```

- Divider's width is increased. Visual appearance change.

- For more details about the new structure, check the diagram how it works.
