This release includes the following changes:
- cmd: add configuration options for `hydra token user` #327 
- warden: add group management and group based policy checks #68 
- docs: improve 5 min tutorial
- sql: include a migration routine for databases #194
- oidc: at_hash / c_hash mismatch - closes #338
- policy: provide rest endpoint for policy updates - closes #305

This PR includes the follwoing **breaking** changes:

## sql: deleting policies does not delete associated records with mysql driver #326

MySQL has a [12 year old bug](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=4919) that ignores shorthand foreign key constraints in `CREATE TABLE` statements. Those were used in ladon, the library responsible for access control policies. This patch resolves this issue by replacing shorthand constraints with explicit indices. You will be able to run your existing database with this patch, but it will not resolve the bug described in #326. However, you can easily update the foreign key constraints manually in your database, the schema [is here](https://github.com/ory-am/ladon/blob/master/manager_sql.go#L25-L41).

Postgres is not affected.

## oauth2/consent: force jti echo in consent response #322

Previously, Hydra accepted signed consent tokens without requiring a special JSON Token ID in the JWT payload. This was deemed secure enough, as expiry times are usually short and OAuth2 clients use random states. However, to make things more secure, the consent app has to include the `jti` value from the consent challenge in the payload of the consent response. Hydra sets a cookie when redirecting to the consent app with the JTI value for validation of the consent response. The cookie is encrypted with a secret passphrase given by `COOKIE_SECRET` and if none is given, falls back to `SYSTEM_SECRET`. We recommend using a dedicated `COOKIE_SECRET` in production.

## policy: provide rest endpoint for policy updates - closes #305

The policy management commands for the CLI have changed, as `hydra policy <action|resource|subject> delete` has been renamed to `hydra policy <action|resource|subject> remove`.

- The system secret is now generated correctly. This will break your JWK store in RethinkDB. You will probably need to remove the jwk table from RethinkDB. Hydra will generate all required keys itself, next time you start a hydra instance.
- The client HTTP API now takes `scope string` instead of `scopes []string`. Example: `{ ""scope"": ""photos openid email"" }`. This change affects RethinkDB as well

## Feature spotlight
- System secrets must now be at least 16 byte long (32 byte before).
- Clients can be imported using the cli command `hydra clients import`.
- The client secret can now be set using the CLI or the HTTP API. It must be at least 6 characters long.
- TLS over HTTP can now be configured to use a file or an environment variable instead of the internal key store. See `hydra help host` for more information

## Backwards Compatibility

This release contains a breaking change. The system secret is now generated using `sha256(secret)` instead of `secret`. This reduces key length requirements which are 32byte for AES-GCM. 

Additionally, you must now provide the `offline` scope in order to receive OAuth2 refresh tokens

## List of changes
- cli: key is now sha256(secret) - closes #86 
- client: creating clients with predefined credentials - closes #91
- client: always autogenerate secrets when using clients create
- cli: CLI should have `-dry` option to show what the HTTP request looks like - closes #99
- cli: fix issue where tls certificate is regenerated on boot - closes #93 
- cli: allow passing of tls certificates via env vars or files - closes #88
- oauth2: add offline scope for refresh tokens - closes #97 
- jwk: support for x5c certificate chains - closes #92 
- all: minor changes - closes #89 
- client: resolved that secrets can not be set when using http or cli #102

In our own experience, existing solutions are either expensive or hard to install and manage. We started to collect user feedback, analized conceptual issues and came up with a plan to re-write hydra with clear goals:
- It must be easy to scale
- It must be highly available
- It must integrate with any identity provider
- It must be secure
- It must be easy to set up and use
- It must be open source
- It must be real time
- It must be documented

As of today, 0.1-beta1 has landed. Try it, break it!

This release is a complete recode of the original code base. Instead of using postgres, Hydra now uses rethinkdb to keep data available in memory. Hydra now uses Fosite and a new Constent Flow. Please read the README for more information.
