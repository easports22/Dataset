We recommend that all users upgrade to this version.

Highlights include:

- Integration with [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), including a new top-level [`read_parquet`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/generated/pandas.read_parquet.html#pandas.read_parquet) function and a [`DataFrame.to_parquet`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_parquet.html#pandas.DataFrame.to_parquet) method, see [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/io.html#io-parquet).

- New user-facing dtype [`pandas.api.types.CategoricalDtype`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/generated/pandas.api.types.CategoricalDtype.html#pandas.api.types.CategoricalDtype) for specifying categoricals independent of the data, see [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/whatsnew.html#whatsnew-0210-enhancements-categorical-dtype).

- The behavior of sum and prod on all-NaN Series/DataFrames is now consistent and no longer depends on whether [bottleneck](http://berkeleyanalytics.com/bottleneck) is installed, see [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/whatsnew.html#whatsnew-0210-api-breaking-bottleneck).

- Compatibility fixes for pypy, see [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/whatsnew.html#whatsnew-0210-pypy).

- Additions to the drop, reindex, and rename API to make them more consistent, see [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/whatsnew.html#whatsnew-0210-enhancements-drop-api)

- Addition of the new methods DataFrame.infer_objects (see [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/whatsnew.html#whatsnew-0210-enhancements-infer-objects)) and GroupBy.pipe (see [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/whatsnew.html#whatsnew-0210-enhancements-groupby-pipe)).

- Indexing with a list of labels, where one or more of the labels is missing, is deprecated and will raise a KeyError in a future version, see [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/whatsnew.html#whatsnew-0210-api-breaking-loc).
