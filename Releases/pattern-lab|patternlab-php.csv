- support for YAML in global data, pattern-specific data, and pseudo-patterns
- can have multiple JSON/YAML files in ./_data/
- support for JSON/YAML linting to find errors
- can set multiple classes using the style modifier
- can use link.[pattern-name] within data to link to other patterns
- pattern parameters support simple lists
- pattern parameters act more like mustache (but not exactly!)
- patternParameters can over listItem loop numbers
- global pattern header and footer is now in ./source/_meta
- upgraded console utility
- patterns and pattern subtypes can be documented in the styleguide by using [pattern-name].md or [pattern-subtype].md
- view all pages for pattern sub-types
- annotations can be defined using Markdown
- patterns can be exported minus Pattern Lab mark-up
- can hide individual patterns from “view all” view still available via the nav
- can set a pattern to be the default pattern when loading Pattern Lab
- can turn on modal view by default
- implemented server
- sayings can now be defined in the config
- install process that makes it easier to install various components

These are the features of Pattern Lab 1 that have become plugins:
