## Added
- `schema.Entity`
  - `processStrategy` for modifying `Entity` objects before they're moved to the `entities` stack.
  - `mergeStrategy` for merging with multiple entities with the same ID.
- Added `schema.Object`, with a shorthand of `{}`
- Added `schema.Array`, with a shorthand of `[ schema ]`

## Changed
- `Schema` has been moved to a `schema` namespace, available at `schema.Entity`
- `arrayOf` has been replaced by `schema.Array` or `[]`
- `unionOf` has been replaced by `schema.Union`
- `valuesOf` has been replaced by `schema.Values`

## Removed
- `normalize` no longer accepts an optional `options` argument. All options are assigned at the schema level.
- Entity schema no longer accepts `defaults` as an option. Use a custom `processStrategy` option to apply defaults as needed.
- `assignEntity` has been replaced by `processStrategy`
- `meta` option. See `processStrategy`

- Now internally using Lodash 4.0, so **support for IE < 9 is removed**. This is aligned with other libraries, e.g. React 15 also drops it, and Microsoft has officially stopped supporting IE 8 a few days ago. (https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr/pull/52)

## New Features
- Adds support for polymorphic fields via `unionOf(schemaMap, options)` which works like the polymorphic support for `arrayOf` and `valuesOf` but for non-collection fields (#40).
- Adds an official `getIdAttribute()` method that existed in v1.0.0, as well as `getKey()`, to the `Schema` prototype. (https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr/pull/48)
