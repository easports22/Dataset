## Changes

* Laravel (the PHP framework powering Koel's backend and API, in case you didn't know) has been upgraded to version 5.4
* The official wiki has been moved to https://koel.phanan.net/docs. Be sure to check it out – I promise you'll love it!
* A new ""Convert and play media at 128kbps on mobile"" option (unchecked by default) has been added to Profile. This instructs Koel to convert the songs into 128kbps mp3's (if ffmpeg is configured and detected) when stream on a mobile device for more optimized speed and bandwidth. IMPORTANT: This feature is experimental and may cause playback issues, in such a case you may want to keep it disabled.
* On Android and with Chrome 57 and newer, playback can now be controlled via the notification center and lock screen, [like this](https://twitter.com/notphanan/status/845849511134031872).
* Next song is now preloaded much sooner instead of 10 seconds to the end of the current song. 
* You can now search specifically for song titles, albums, or artists using the `in:` operator, for example searching for `keeper in:title` will only return the song ""Keeper of the Seven Keys"" and not the whole [albums with the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeper_of_the_Seven_Keys). Similarly, you have `in:artist` and `in:album`.
* Various bug fixes and improvements.

## Upgrade

1. Make a backup of everything: Koel, its server, its server's server, the load balancer, the DNS zone file, the CDN settings, maybe [the whole AWS even](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/2/14792636/amazon-aws-internet-outage-cause-human-error-incorrect-command). You can never be too careful these days, hey.
1. From the installation folder:
  ```bash
  git fetch
  git checkout v3.6.0
  composer install
  php artisan koel:init
  ```

## Downgrade

1. Restore your backup
1. Let me know what went wrong

- Fixed a bug in the equalizer that'd prevent Koel from starting in certain cases (by @X-Ryl669)
- Authentication API now returns more proper HTTP codes (by @X-Ryl669)
- Added `predis` into `composer.json` so Laravel folks can use Redis for its session and cache drivers if they want too (by @MelonSmasher)
- Bumped the version (by me, because I want some credits with this new version too!)

## Changes
- The long-awaited virtual scrolling feature is here! Now you can scroll through your tens of thousands of songs smoothly without the awkward loading-more pause. Big ups to @Akryum for his incredible [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller) plugin!
- The query to get artist, album, and song information upon Koel's bootup is now cached by default. This should give the app a performance boost.
- Talking about performance, some optimizations have been put in place, and now the initial data parsing process is up to 100% faster – yes, I tested this myself!
- If you have Last.fm integrated (and why not?), you should have noticed the track listing panel to the right. Previously it didn't do much except for, well, listing the tracks. Starting from this version, though, tracks missing from your library will have a link to purchase on iTunes.
  
  <img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8056274/21960297/b9184d66-db20-11e6-853b-a02b99b05a65.png"" alt=""Track Listing Before and After"" width=""668"" style=""max-width: 100%"" />
  
  Now I have a confession to make: These links are associated with my iTunes affiliate account, which means I'd earn several _cents_ each time you buy a track from them – see it as a way to support this project, will ya? I don't know yet how it will work out (if at all), though, so this is very experimental and may be removed in the future.
- The ""recently played"" song list is now persistent between browser sessions.
- jQuery has been completely removed and replaced by leaner, more modern, libraries and solutions. For example, `$.ajax`'s job is now handled by [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios), DOM traversing and manipulation by modern browser API's etc.
- As always, various bug fixes and cleanups.

## Upgrade Path
1. Create a backup of the whole stuff
2. Run this series of commands, which, in all honesty, has become quite boring for me to type now:
   
   ``` bash
   git fetch
   git checkout v3.5.0
   composer install
   php artisan koel:init
   ```
3. (Optional) If you want to disable the media query cache above, add `MEDIA_CACHE=false` into `.env`

## Downgrade Guide

Restore your backup, or just do a `git checkout v3.4.1 && yarn install`. Also, [open an issue](https://github.com/phanan/koel/issues/new) to let me know what went wrong, maybe?

After all, there's a whopping of 118 commits since the last release! Thanks everyone for your continuing support – ideas, bug reports, pull requests – keep it coming!

## Changes

### Visible Changes
- You can now instruct Koel to ignore (by default) or cater for dot files and folders when scanning
- The UI fonts are now inherited from [system UI fonts](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/) instead of Roboto.
- Song selection is now properly kept track of (fixes #427)
- The CSS3-based loading/playing animation has been replaced with an animated GIF to avoid high CPU issue (fixes #481)
- More visible feedbacks for time-consuming actions (create playlists, add/remove songs from playlists etc.)
- The add/edit user forms are completely revamped
- Song listing in Last.fm album information is now linked to available songs in your library

### Under the Hood
- Laravel's version is bumped to 5.3 – see Upgrade Guide
- `npm` has been replaced with [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) – see Upgrade Guide
- JavaScript (Vue) code base went through a massive, complete lint. Now `yarn test` will lint the code via [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).
- A pretty complete E2E test suite is here, finally – see ""A Note on E2E""
- Lots of bug fixes, improvements, and refactorings!

## Upgrade Guide
1. First, install or update `yarn` to the latest version with `npm install -g yarn`
2. Add `BROADCAST_DRIVER=log` into `.env`
3. Add `IGNORE_DOT_FILES=true` (or replace `true` with `false` if you want Koel to scan for hidden files and folders) into `.env`
4. Clean Laravel's `bootstrap/cache` folder, for example `rm -rf ./app/bootstrap/cache && mkdir ./app/bootstrap/cache`
5. Remove `node_modules` folder as well, to make sure there's no leftover thingies
6. Now execute this series of commands from your installation folder

``` bash
git fetch
git checkout v3.4.0
composer install
php artisan koel:init
```

## Downgrade Guide

Just `git checkout v3.3.1 && npm install` to revert to the previous version.

## A Note on E2E

This new version of Koel comes with an E2E test suite, which (hopefully) should help eliminate all those regressive UI bugs for good. In order to run these tests, though, you'll need to have [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/), [facebook/php-webdriver](https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver), and [Chrome driver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver) installed on your system and run your Selenium grid:

``` bash
java -jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/path/to/chromedriver selenium-server-standalone-3.0.1.jar
```

Now you can execute the E2E test with `yarn e2e` and hope everything smoothly goes through.

That's it! Till next release!

v3.3.0 introduces a good set of changes and features:
- Fixes pause and resume functionality in home-song-item (@bdgold)
- Fixes drag and drop issues
- Koel now looks for cover images under the song's directory as well (#380)
- Recently added songs and albums are displayed on Home screen (#379)
- Koel now alerts and confirms for destructive actions
- `php artisan koel:sync` now comes with a handy progress bar
- If a song fails to be synced, the error is now reported in verbose mode (@X-Ryl669)
- Environment variables are now cached and used from config files (@bdgold)
- Various minor fixes and improvements as usual

Now when a song is played, Koel will search YouTube for related videos and display them in the sidebar, ready for you to watch from within Koel itself. The only thing you need to do is fill in `.env` with your `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, which can be obtained by doing the following:
1. [Create a new Google Project](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. From the project's Dashboard, click “ENABLE API” and make sure “YouTube Data API v3” is enabled
3. From the project's Credentials, click Create credentials → API Key → Server key

It might also be worth noting that:
- YouTube integration is always disabled on mobile, and
- You interact with the videos via YouTube's own controls and not Koel's. Koel's equalizer, volume, seeker, play/pause… will simply not work for videos

Now to the usual…

## Upgrade Guide
1. Back up Koel. You don't need to back up the database this time, although it's only good that you make it a habit.
2. Run these commands from Koel's installation directory:
   
   ``` bash
   git fetch --all
   git checkout v3.2.0
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install

As the biggest update yet, Koel v3.0.0 comes with a bunch of shiny features. Let's go through the most significant ones, one by one:
- **AWS Integration**: You [asked](https://github.com/phanan/koel/issues/301) [for](https://github.com/phanan/koel/issues/71) [it](https://github.com/phanan/koel/issues/300), and here it is!

For a step-by-step installation instruction, check out its [README](https://github.com/phanan/koel-aws/blob/master/README.md) file.
- **Downloads**: Even though Koel was born to solve the local disk space issue, you might still want to download songs back to your computer from time to time. Well, now you can! Just right click on a song (or multiple songs, which requires the [ZipArchive](http://php.net/manual/en/class.ziparchive.php) module) and click ""Download."" You can also download a whole album or a whole artist discography (make sure your server has enough memory for this, though!). Don't want to allow downloading? Just specify `ALLOW_DOWNLOAD=false` into your `.env` file.
  
  _Note: Download doesn't work with Amazon S3 – yet!_
- **Share**: We all know Koel has multi-user support from day one, but how did you share your beloved song with another user in the past? Right, you couldn't – my apologies. But guess what? It's doable now! Just right-click, copy the shareable link, and send it. Upon Koel's loading, the song will be queued, and played automatically _if you're not on an iDevice_ (which doesn't allow audio autoplay as a policy).
- **Artist and album info**: If you've connected Koel with Last.fm (and you should!), an ""Info"" link is now available in the Artist and Album view. Clicking in will load, duh, the current artist or album's information.
- **Compilation album, or Album artist support**: This has been on [top](https://github.com/phanan/koel/issues/322) [of](https://github.com/phanan/koel/issues/21) [the request list](https://github.com/phanan/koel/issues/166) for so long, and I'm sorry for that, but it's finally here. Granted, it's _kind of_ experimental, the Song Edit function is a big sluggish, and you'll need a rescan for it to work (see Upgrade Guide), but hey, better than none!
- **Vue 2.0**: Yes, this is not really Koel-related, but as a core VueJS team member, I'm proud to be one of the first adopters of the awesome Vue 2.0. Vue 2.0 comes with so many improvements that I can't list down here – I'd suggest you read [Evan You's announcement](https://vuejs.org/2016/04/27/announcing-2.0/) instead – but you can notice the performance boost, especially if you have a huge music library. 

Then, here come some smaller changes:
- Album item's Play button now plays the album by track order (#314)
- Artist names in ""Most Played Songs"" are now clickable (#303)
- Gzip support has been added into the bundled `.htaccess` and the sample nginx config file
- Lots of improvements and bug fixes. I would like to thank @alex-phillips, @bdgold, @daniele-athome, @PeterDaveHello, and @caffinatedmonkey for your awesome contributions.

## Upgrade Guide

**Make a backup of your database. Really. This is a major upgrade with a full rescan, so better be safe than sorry.**

Then, from your installation directory, run these commands:

``` bash
git fetch --all
git checkout v3.0.0

# Upgrading VueJS from 1.x to 2.x requires removal of the obsolete Node modules
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

composer install
php artisan migrate --force

## Now force rescanning the media directory. This might take a while. Be patient.
php artisan koel:sync --force --tags=artist,compilation
```

## When Things Break

Alas. Now you know why backups are so important.

## I Need Your Help

- On Linux, files and folders can now be watched and synchronized on the fly in conjunction with [inotifywait](http://linux.die.net/man/1/inotifywait) -- see **Upgrade Guides**

## Upgrade Guide

### First, the usuals
1. Back up, and verify
2. From the installation folder:
   
   ```
   git fetch --all
   git checkout v2.1.0
   npm install
   composer install
   ```
3. There's no step 3 actually.

### Watch and sync on the fly with `inotifywait`

Starting from this version, Koel provides a mean to help watch your media directory and trigger _selective_ synchronization every time there's a change to it. With this you don't have to run a whole time-consuming `koel:sync` process for just one added song. The actual watching is done by [inotifywait](http://linux.die.net/man/1/inotifywait), a popular filesystem watcher on Linux – sorry Mac and Windows folks. 

In order to start using the feature, follow these simple steps:
1. Install inotify tools. On CentOS for example, you can run this shell command:
   
   ``` bash
   sudo yum --enablerepo=epel -y install inotify-tools
   ```
2. Set up a watcher script to run `inotifywait` and send the output to `koel:sync` artisan command. For example, you can create a sample `watch` file in Koel's root directory:
   
   ``` bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   MEDIA_PATH=/var/www/media/
   PHP_BIN=/usr/bin/php
   
   inotifywait -rme move,close_write,delete --format ""%e %w%f"" $MEDIA_PATH | while read file; do
     $PHP_BIN artisan koel:sync ""${file}""
   done
   ```
3. Run the watcher in the background. Following the above example:
   
   ``` bash
   $ chmod +x watch
   $ ./watch
   [Ctrl+z]
   $ bg
   $ disown -h
   ```
4. Verify it works by `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log` while doing changes to your media directory.

Some notes:
- This feature is still in its early days. Be sure to report any spotted bugs.
- Though, in theory, you can watch _any_ directory other than or outside of your media root, it's not recommended, as the next manual `php artisan koel:sync` call will simply remove all those invalid entries.

### Upgrade Guide

This version shouldn't break anything. In order to upgrade, simply run these command from the installation's root:

```

Koel 1.1 comes with lots of changes, most of them are (hopefully) improvements:
- Integration with Last.fm
- Better mobile experience
- Support for nginx X-Accel-Redirect added
- Support for AAC added (experimental)
- Streaming method configuration is now explicit
- Various bug fixes, optimizations, and enhancements

### Upgrade Guide

#### 0. Back up

Back up your installation of Koel, including application files and database dump. Verify it. And verify it again.

#### 1. Get the latest code

``` bash
git fetch --all
git checkout v1.1.2
```

#### 2. Upgrade Laravel, install packages, and migrate database

Laravel has been updated from 5.1 to 5.2 to make use of some new awesome features. To adapt the changes, run the following commands:

``` bash
composer install
php artisan migrate --force
```

#### 3. Compile Koel’s client

``` bash
npm update
NODE_ENV=production
gulp --production
```

#### 4. Integrate with Last.fm (Optional)

Starting from 1.1, Koel can be configured to integrate with Last.fm and retrieve interesting information about the current playing song – artist bio, album cover and track listing, track interaction and scrobbling etc. In order to start using these functionalities, just [create a Last.fm API account](http://www.last.fm/api/account/create) and fill the credentials into `.env`, namely these two variables:

```
LASTFM_API_KEY=
LASTFM_API_SECRET=
```

Afterwards you can connect your Last.fm account with Koel from the Profile page.

#### 5. Set your streaming method (Optional)

The first version of Koel automatically detects the availability of `mod_xsendfile` module and prefers it over native PHP’s `sendfile` for streaming. To prevent possible problems originating from Apache configuration errors, this behavior has been removed. You will now need to explicitly set a streaming method in `.env` file for any other than `php`:

```
# The streaming method.
# Can be either 'php' (default), 'x-sendfile', or 'x-accel-redirect'
# See https://github.com/phanan/koel/wiki#streaming-music for more information.
STREAMING_METHOD=php
```

### Things went south?

Just restore the previous installation from the backup volume created in step 0. You completed the step, did you not? Did you not?

## Upgrade Guide
1. First, backup, verify, and verify again. 
2. Now from the root of your installation, run
   
   ``` bash
   git fetch --all
   git checkout v2.0.0
   npm install
   composer install
   php artisan migrate
   ```
3. By now you should have all npm modules installed and Koel compiled. If for some reason it's not the case, run
   
   ``` bash
   bower install
   cross-env NODE_ENV=production
   gulp --production
   ```
4. Add a `JWT_SECRET` configuration into `.env` for JWT authentication to work. You can do that manually, or simply execute
   
   ``` bash
   php artisan koel:generate-jwt-secret
   ```
5. (Optional) If you're using a CDN, add a `CDN_URL` variable into `.env`
   
   ``` bash
   CDN_URL=http://cdn.koel.dev
   ```
   
   Confirm it works by checking http://cdn.koel.dev/robot.txt.
6. (Optional) Starting from this version, Koel provides experimental support for FLAC. Such support is done via [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) transcoding, so make sure you have it installed **[with mp3 library](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/MP3)** and executable by the Apache/nginx user. Then, in `.env`, set the two following variables:
   
   ``` bash
   FFMPEG_PATH=/absolute/path/to/ffmpeg/binary
   
   # The bit rate of the out mp3 stream. Higher value results in better quality,
   # but bigger file and more bandwidth. Defaults to 128.
   OUTPUT_BIT_RATE=128
   ```
   
   You should be now set. Keep in mind though, that certain limitations come with this FLAC support – for instance, you can't seek a FLAC stream.

That's it! Enjoy Koel!
