Phpdocumentor is now able to parse files using php 5.5+ syntax, but will not process any of the new key words to documentation. 

Beside the mentioned parser update a number of small issues are solved in this release. 
- Pear install on windows should work from now.
- Improved error reporting messages
- Silent mode was restored. phpdocumentor will not produce any output when `--quiet` flag is used.
- `@See` rendering is improved for clean template.
- Resolved issues with `@inheritDoc` that was not working as expected for interfaces.

This introduced a fatal issue where if you tried to use the phar distribution of phpDocumentor from a folder with a composer.json that it used that composer.json to autoload its library files. This of course caused a fatal error.

This hotfix release is all about reverting the offending change; after this the fatal errors caused by this are history.

The most significant addition would be a new command line option `--cache-folder` with which you can tell phpDocumentor to write the cache files to a specific location. This is awesome if you want to keep your cache and docs separate or when setting up a Continuous Integration environment.

The second most interesting is the `self-update` command for the Phar installation for phpDocumentor. With this we follow in the footsteps of composer by adding the means to easily update your phar file an exchange it for a newer version of phpDocumentor.

## What's next

A few days ago Mike van Riel posted a blog post (http://mikevanriel.com/entry/phpdocumentor-an-update) where he unveiled the changes that he is working on; combine that with the awesome contributions that we receive from the community means that interesting things are waiting on the horizon.

The changes that Mike is working on (which he lovingly dubbed `Operation Blue Lightning`) are meant to speed phpDocumentor up by a more than significant amount by refactoring some of the architecture of phpDocumentor. This will quite surely take more than the usual six weeks that we use per release and as such we will release version 2.9 as soon as Mike has finished his work on Blue Lightning.

Progress of this release can be tracked using a milestone that was created for this purpose: https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor2/milestones/Blue Lightning.

Happy hacking and until next time!

In this release we have fixed various issues that have been reported and thanks to an amazing Testfest in Amsterdam the Code Coverage has risen with at least 8%! A huge thanks to all who participated there.

In preparation for Testfest we have switched the provisioning of the development machines to use Ansible instead of puppet and made some parts optional (such as profiling and doc generation), making it a lot easier to use the virtual machine.

Something which is not reflected in the changelog below is that we have automated the deploys of the phpDocumentor website and the releases for phpDocumentor itself. In the past a release took several hours to prepare and execute, now we can do 75% of it within 15 minutes. I hope that we can automate the remaining bit as well but that is something for the future.

For a complete list of changes, see the changelog below and enjoy the new version!

These weeks go by faster than you'd expect; but in the mean time we haven't sat still at all. The main improvement for this release is that Variadics have been implemented and the Clean template now also features a shiny deprecated elements report.

And of course you haven't sat still as well. phpDocumentor is out there and used a lot, and as a result of that we receive new issue reports regularly which we try to fix as soon as we can. 

_All I can say is: keep them coming!_

These issue reports help us to make phpDocumentor even more awesome than it already is (at least, we like to think so ;)).

Specifically issues with the way phpDocumentor inherits information have been fixed though there are still some remaining.

In addition to the above we have merged our sister-project Scrybe into phpDocumentor itself as a plugin. That means that starting with this release there is a foundation with which we can start working towards being a complete documentation solution, including reference material.

The Scrybe plugin is currently in alpha but is capable of transforming RestructuredText, and more formats in the future, to HTML and PDF documents. Let us know what you think of it but do expect quite a bit of bugs there; it is an early product.

Also have we started integrating DOMPDF and created a PDF writer with which PDF files can be generated from HTML output of phpDocumentor. Unfortunately there is no template yet, so it is not possible to use this new feature out of the box. We intend to add such a template in the future.

For a complete list of changes, see this list:

```
ADDED:     Support for writing PDF files using a Twig template by adding the PDF writer.
ADDED:     More documentation on types, running phpDocumentor, the @var tag.
ADDED:     Support for sorting lists with Twig and XSLT.
ADDED:     Basic support for generating reference documentation with ReST documents.
CHANGED:   Replaced custom phar building with the library from http://box-project.org.
FIXED:     #1090: GraphViz issues where the global namespace caused GraphViz not to generate.
FIXED:     #1037 by @siad007: if opcode cache is enabled for CLI then annotations are dropped.
FIXED:     #1031: Fixed inheritance for the summary, description, tags and the way @inheritdoc works.
FIXED:     Adding several unit tests.
FIXED:     Cleaned up code to remove warnings and errors.
FIXED:     #1111: An infinite loop occurred during processing of global constants.

![Party!](http://www.hdwallpapers.in/wallpapers/enjoying_party_vector-1280x800.jpg)

We have spent the past two months fixing bugs, adding tests and writing a brand new template. With this release it is now easier than ever to generate your documentation.

And as a special party gift we bring you a brand new template, called _Clean_. Can't wait to see what it looks like? [Then come over and see the demo](http://demo.phpdoc.org/Clean/).

### That's it?

Does this mean that we are done? No, there are several tags in the PHPDoc standard that are not fully implemented, features that would make phpDocumentor even more awesome and room to improve performance.

And that is what we are going to do! We will continue to improve the leading documentation tool for PHP, there are still so many awesome things to come.

### What's next

In the upcoming cycle, version 2.1, we will be working on making the existing features and existing templates even more robust and usable, adding search capabilities and _improving performance_.

You can see more [details on the roadmap for 2.1](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor2/issues?milestone=16&state=open).
