   * It is now possible to skip running startup files such as /etc/rc.local.

   * It ensures that all processes in the container are properly shut down with SIGTERM, even those that are not direct child processes of `my_init`.

   * It is now possible to enable the insecure key by passing `--enable-insecure-key` to `my_init`. This allows users to easily enable the insecure key for convenience reasons, without having the insecure key enabled permanently in the image.
   * `my_init` now exports environment variables to the directory `/etc/container_environment` and to the files `/etc/container_environment.sh`, `/etc/container_environment.json`. This allows all applications to query what the original environment variables were. It is also possible to change the environment variables in `my_init` by modifying `/etc/container_environment`. More information can be found in the README, section ""Environment variables"".
   * Fixed a bug that causes it not to print messages to stdout when there is no pseudo terminal. This is because Python buffers stdout by default.
   * Fixed an incorrectly printed message.
 * The insecure key is now also available in PuTTY format. (Thomas LÉVEIL)
 * Fixed `enable_insecure_key` removing already installed SSH keys. (Thomas LÉVEIL)
 * The baseimage-docker image no longer EXPOSEs any ports by default. The EXPOSE entries were originally there to enable some default guest-to-host port forwarding entries, but in recent Docker versions they changed the meaning of EXPOSE, and now EXPOSE is used for linking containers. As such, we no longer have a reason to EXPOSE any ports by default. Fixes GH-15.
 * Fixed syslog-ng not being able to start because of a missing afsql module. Fixes the issue described in [pull request 7](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/pull/7).
 * Removed some default Ubuntu cron jobs which are not useful in Docker containers.
 * Added the logrotate service. Fixes GH-22.

 * Fixed a problem with my_init not correctly passing child processes' exit status. Fixes GH-45.
 * When reading environment variables from /etc/container_environment, the trailing newline (if any) is ignored. This makes commands like this work, without unintentially adding a newline to the environment variable value:

        echo my_value > /etc/container_environment/FOO

   If you intended on adding a newline to the value, ensure you have *two* trailing newlines:

        echo -e ""my_value\n"" > /etc/container_environment/FOO

# Additional Notes

 - I have implemented travis-ci to help speed up the testing and iteration process, this should help us to setup automated releases on a monthly schedule moving forward.
 - I am deprecating Changelog.md in favor of [GitHub releases](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/releases)
 - I have removed the `rel-` prefix from versions in favor of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).
 - I have created a channel on my [Mattermost instance].(http://mattermost.dynamictivity.com/signup_user_complete/?id=pjksr6h977n4zxxyto3ojp8twa) where any interested party can actively discuss `baseimage-docker`. Simply click the [invite link](http://mattermost.dynamictivity.com/signup_user_complete/?id=pjksr6h977n4zxxyto3ojp8twa), register on the GitLab instance and you will be directed to the Mattermost team.
