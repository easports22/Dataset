7145129,2017-07-24T13:43:43Z,2017-07-24T13:50:39Z,v0.11,"* Feat: **IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGE** Header normalisation **no longer** does anything to hyphens or underscores. Previously, headers were normalised so that `h.content_type` was equally as valid as `h[""Content-Type""]`. However, this breaks real world cases where `h.HEADER_NAME` must be forwaded with the underscore intact. Header names are now **only** normalised for case, as per the HTTP spec.
