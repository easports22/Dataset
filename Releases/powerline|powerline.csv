  conjunction with `--replace`.
- Fixed outdated tmux versions support (1.6 and 1.7).

Incompatible changes:
- Removed CtrlP support. If one wants to readd it make sure to fix problems 
  listed in 4e6b0a7ec8f2fa54053e4162c8b604a85e8d667d.

  function output) was renamed to `highlight_groups` (note the trailing `s`).
- `attr` key in colorschemes was renamed to `attrs` key (note the trailing `s`).
- All highlight groups looking like `foo.bar` were renamed to `foo:bar`: dot in 
  highlight group names is no longer allowed.
- `detect` argument value was renamed to `auto` in network segments.
- `$POWERLINE_COMMAND` is now a single path to one executable. No arguments to 
  the executable are allowed inside `$POWERLINE_COMMAND`. Overrides using 
  argument to `$POWERLINE_COMMAND` are now deprecated.

  and tmux bindings now support overrides from `$POWERLINE_CONFIG_OVERRIDES` and

  zpython bindings when talking about overrides.

  dictionaries `g:powerline_theme_overrides` dictionary should be used. Theme 
  names in this case are top-level keys in the new dictionary.
- In IPython configuration paths list can be specified via `config_paths` 
  option, not via `paths` option.
- Some long options that defined overrides were renamed:
  - `--theme_option` was renamed to `--theme-override`.
  - `--config` was renamed to `--config-override`.
    Note that these options are deprecated and shall be used for testing purposes 
    only.
- All long options that used to have underscore in them are now using 
  HYPHEN-MINUS instead. I.e.
  - `--config_path` was renamed to `--config-path`.
  - `--last_pipe_status` was renamed to `--last-pipe-status`.
  - `--renderer_arg` was renamed to `--renderer-arg`.
  - `--theme_option` was renamed to `--theme-override`.
    Short options were not touched.

  found in documentation, section [Common segments](http://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/master/configuration/segments/common.html).
- Segments `powerline.segments.common.now_playing` and 
  `powerline.segments.common.players.now_playing` were removed. In place of them 
  all players should be accessed via their own segments. List of segments is 
  available in [Media players](http://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/master/configuration/segments/common.html#module-powerline.segments.common.players).
