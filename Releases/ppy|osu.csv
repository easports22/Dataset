- Replay playback! Drag an .osr file into the window. Note that you will need to *reimport all beatmaps* before this works (so consider deleting your database and starting from scratch). We will not be providing migration/upgrading support for game databases this early in development.
- Autoplay! Select from mod select menu #436. 
- New version footer in options overlay #446.
- F1-F3 work to actuate buttons on song select #447.
- Better internal handling of mods (allows them to actually do stuff) #448.
- Improved CI-enforced coding standards and reduced framework suggestions/warnings/errors to zero (osu! game project has around 300 left to address).
