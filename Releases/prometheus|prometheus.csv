- Release tarballs now contain the built binaries in a nested directory.
- The `hash_mod` relabeling action now uses MD5 hashes instead of FNV hashes to
  achieve a better distribution.
- The DNS-SD meta label `__meta_dns_srv_name` was renamed to `__meta_dns_name`
  to reflect support for DNS record types other than `SRV`.
- The default full refresh interval for the file-based service discovery has been
  increased from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
- In relabeling, parts of a source label that weren't matched by
  the specified regular expression are no longer included in the replacement
  output.
- Queries no longer interpolate between two data points. Instead, the resulting
  value will always be the latest value before the evaluation query timestamp.
- Regular expressions supplied via the configuration are now anchored to match
  full strings instead of substrings.
- Global labels are not appended upon storing time series anymore. Instead,
  they are only appended when communicating with external systems
  (Alertmanager, remote storages, federation). They have thus also been renamed
  from `global.labels` to `global.external_labels`.
- The names and units of metrics related to remote storage sample appends have
  been changed.
- The experimental support for writing to InfluxDB has been updated to work
  with InfluxDB 0.9.x. 0.8.x versions of InfluxDB are not supported anymore.
- Escape sequences in double- and single-quoted string literals in rules or query
  expressions are now interpreted like escape sequences in Go string literals
  (https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_literals).

Future breaking changes / deprecated features:
- The `delta()` function had an undocumented optional second boolean argument
  to make it behave like `increase()`. This second argument will be removed in
  the future. Migrate any occurrences of `delta(x, 1)` to use `increase(x)`
  instead.
- Support for filter operators between two scalar values (like `2 > 1`) will be
  removed in the future. These will require a `bool` modifier on the operator,
  e.g.  `2 > bool 1`.

All changes:
- [CHANGE] Renamed `global.labels` to `global.external_labels`.
- [CHANGE] Vendoring is now done via govendor instead of godep.
- [CHANGE] Change web UI root page to show the graphing interface instead of
  the server status page.
- [CHANGE] Append global labels only when communicating with external systems
  instead of storing them locally.
- [CHANGE] Change all regexes in the configuration to do full-string matches
  instead of substring matches.
- [CHANGE] Remove interpolation of vector values in queries.
- [CHANGE] For alert `SUMMARY`/`DESCRIPTION` template fields, cast the alert
  value to `float64` to work with common templating functions.
- [CHANGE] In relabeling, don't include unmatched source label parts in the
  replacement.
- [CHANGE] Change default full refresh interval for the file-based service
  discovery from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
- [CHANGE] Rename the DNS-SD meta label `__meta_dns_srv_name` to
  `__meta_dns_name` to reflect support for other record types than `SRV`.
- [CHANGE] Release tarballs now contain the binaries in a nested directory.

  string literals.

All metrics stored with previous versions of Prometheus cannot be used anymore. A version guard will protect you from accidentally running the Prometheus server with an incompatible storage. Implementing a conversion tool would be a lot of work (but if somebody wants to do it, be our guest...), so there is no other solution right now but wiping the storage or stick with v0.11.1.

To sweeten the deal, fingerprinting is now more efficient, and we have also thrown in new features (OR operator and vector matching options).
- [CHANGE] Use client_golang v0.3.1. THIS CHANGES FINGERPRINTING AND INVALIDATES
  ALL PERSISTED FINGERPRINTS. You have to wipe your storage to use this or
  later versions. There is a version guard in place that will prevent you to
  run Prometheus with the stored data of an older Prometheus.
- [BUGFIX] The change above fixes a weakness in the fingerprinting algorithm.
- [ENHANCEMENT] The change above makes fingerprinting faster and less allocation
  intensive.
- [FEATURE] OR operator and vector matching options. See docs for details.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Scientific notation and special float values (Inf, NaN) now
  supported by the expression language.
- [CHANGE] Dockerfile makes Prometheus use the Docker volume to store data
  (rather than /tmp/metrics).
- [CHANGE] Makefile uses Go 1.4.2.

  or commit 0851945, series would not be archived, chunk descriptors would
  not be evicted, and stale head chunks would never be closed. This happened
  due to accidental deletion of a line calling a (well tested :) function.

  Also fix a related but less severe bug in counting chunk descriptors.
- [BUGFIX] Check last time in head chunk for head chunk timeout, not first.

Early warning: The fingerprinting method has an embarrassing bug
(https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/issues/74), which will be
fixed in v0.12.0, but that will obviously invalidate each and every
persisted fingerprint. We thought long about a conversion path or
allowing to continue with the old fingerprinting method but could not
come up with anything feasible. So one more storage wipe is looming...
