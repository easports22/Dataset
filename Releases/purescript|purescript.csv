### `RowToList` support

(@LiamGoodacre)

There is a new type class in `typelevel-prelude` called `RowToList`, which turns
a row of types into a type-level list. This allows us to work with closed
rows in more ways at the type level. The compiler will now solve these constraints
automatically for closed rows of types.

### Enhancements

#### Type signatures in instances

(@cdepillabout)

Type class instances can now include type signatures for class members, as documentation:

```purescript
data MyType = MyType String

instance showMyType :: Show MyType where
  show :: MyType -> String
  show (MyType s) = ""(MyType "" <> show s <> "")""
```

## `purs ide`

### Features

- Add a new namespace filter (#2792, @sectore, @stefanholzmueller)

A new filter, which restricts query results to the value, type and/or kind namespaces, which allows improvements to the completion and import commands.

- Adds a command to add qualified imports (@kRITZCREEK)

This empowers editor plugins to add imports for qualified identifiers, for example in [the Emacs plugin](https://github.com/epost/psc-ide-emacs/pull/103).

- New import formatting (@kRITZCREEK)
- Group reexports in completions (@kRITZCREEK)

Editors can now choose to let `purs ide` group reexports for the same value, to reduce noise when completing values like `Data.Functor.map` which are reexported a lot and show up that many times in the completion list.

### Enhancements

- Parse modules in parallel (@kRITZCREEK)

This can yield significant speedups in the initial load times. For example a full load of `slamdata/slamdata` improves from 11 to 6 seconds

### Polymorphic Labels

(@paf31)

A new `RowCons` constraint has been added to `Prim`. `RowCons` is a 4-way relation between

1. Symbols
1. Types
1. Input rows
1. Output rows

which appends a new label (1) with the specified type (2) onto the front of the input row (3), to generate a new output row (4). The constraint can also be run backwards to subtract a label from an output row.

This allows us to quantify types over labels appearing at the front of a row type, by quantifying over the corresponding symbol/type pair. This gives us a limited form of polymorphic labels which enables things like writing [a single lens for any record accessor](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/blob/e4ff177017f1411ad4cbeade129cfe1bb52d6e99/examples/passing/PolyLabels.purs#L41-L51).

Many thanks to the contributors who helped with this release!

## Breaking Changes

(@garyb, @paf31)

### `=>` now acts like a binary type operator

It was previously possible to specify many constraints in the same context by
separating them with commas inside parentheses on the left of the `=>`:

```purescript
runFreeT :: ∀ m f. (Functor f, Monad m) => ...
```

This is no longer allowed. Instead, `=>` now acts like a binary operator, with a
constraint on the left and a type on the right. Multiple constraints must be
introduced using currying, as with regular function arguments:

```purescript
runFreeT :: ∀ m f. Functor f => Monad m => ...
```

This is in preparation for adding _constraint kinds_, at which point `=>` will become
an actual binary type operator, defined in `Prim`.

### `*` and `!` kinds have been removed

The kind symbols `*` (for the kind of types) and `!` (for the kind of effects) have been
removed from the parser. Instead of `*`, use `Type`, which is defined in `Prim`.
Instead of `!`, use `Effect`, which can now be imported from `Control.Monad.Eff`.

The `#` symbol, which is used to construct a row kind, is still supported. We cannot move this kind into `Prim` (because it is polykinded, and we do not support kind polymorphism).

### One single consolidated executable

The various `psc-*` executables have been replaced with a single executable called `purs`.
The various subcommands are documented on the `--help` page:

```
bundle     Bundle compiled PureScript modules for the browser
compile    Compile PureScript source files
docs       Generate Markdown documentation from PureScript source files
hierarchy  Generate a GraphViz directed graph of PureScript type classes
ide        Start or query an IDE server process
publish    Generates documentation packages for upload to Pursuit
repl       Enter the interactive mode (PSCi)
```

Wrapper scripts will be provided in the binary distribution.

### `psc-package` was removed

`psc-package` has been removed from the main compiler distribution. It will still
be maintained along with the package sets repo, but will not be bundled with the compiler.

A binary distribution which is compatible with this release is [available](https://github.com/purescript/psc-package/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

### Implicitly discarded values in `do` blocks now raise errors

Code which discards the result of a computation in a `do` block:

```purescript
duplicate :: Array a -> Array a
duplicate xs = do
  x <- xs
  [true, false] -- the result here is discarded
  pure x
```

will now raise an error. The compiler allows values of certain types to be discarded,
based on the `Discard` class in `Control.Bind`. The only type which can be discarded is
`Unit`, but the feature was implemented using a type class to enable support for 
alternative preludes.

### No more dependency on the Bower executable

In addition to removing `psc-package` from the compiler distribution, we have also
removed any explicit dependency on the Bower executable. The compiler will not assume
use of any particular package manager, but will aim to provide generic support for
package managers generally, via command line options and hooks.

`purs publish` will continue to use the Bower JSON formats. The `bower.json` format
is now referred to as the ""manifest file"", while the output of `bower list --json`,
which is used by `purs publish` internally, is referred to as the ""resolutions file"".

## Enhancements

### Pattern Guards

(@alexbiehl)

In addition to regular guards:

```purescript
foo x | condition x = ...
```

the compiler now supports _pattern guards_, which let the user simultaneously
test a value against a pattern, and bind names to values.

For example, we can apply a function `fn` to an argument `x`, succeeding only if
`fn` returns `Just y` for some `y`, binding `y` at the same time:

```purescript
bar x | Just y <- fn x = ... -- x and y are both in scope here
```

Pattern guards can be very useful for expressing certain types of control flow when
using algebraic data types.

### HTML Documentation

(@hdgarrood)

The `--format html` option has been added to `purs docs`. The HTML format uses
the Pursuit template, and is very useful for rendering documentation for offline
use.

[Here is an example](http://harry.garrood.me/purs-html-docs-example/) of the generated HTML.

### Duplicate Labels

(@paf31)

Row types now support duplicate labels, which can be useful when using the `Eff`
monad. For example, we could not previously use the `catchException` function if
the resulting action _also_ required the `EXCEPTION` effect, since otherwise the
type of the inner action would contain a duplicate label.

Rows are now unordered collections (of labels and types) _with duplicates_. However,
the collection of types for a specific label within a row _is_ ordered.
Conceptually, a row can be thought of as a type-level `Map Label (NonEmptyList Type)`.

A type constructor (such as `Record`) which takes a row of types as an argument should
define what its meaning is on each row. The meaning of a value of type `Record r`
is a JavaScript object where the type of the value associated with each label is given
by the head element of the non-empty list of types for that label.

### Row Constraints

(@doolse, @paf31)

A new constraint called `Union` has been added to `Prim`. `Union` is a three-way relation between
rows of types, and the compiler will solve it automatically when it is possible to do so.

`Union` is a left-biased union of rows which takes into account duplicate labels. If the same label appears in rows `l` and `r`, and `Union l r u` holds, then the label will appear twice in `u`.

`Union` makes it possible to give a type to the function which merges two records:

```purescript
merge :: forall r1 r2 r3. Union r1 r2 r3 => Record r1 -> Record r2 -> Record r3
```

Note that this is a left-biased merge - if the two input record contain a common label, the type of the
label in the result will be taken from the left input.

### Patterns in `let` expressions

(@noraesae)

Let expressions and `where` clauses can now use binders on the left hand side of
a declaration:

```purescript
map f xs = 
  let { head, tail } = uncons xs
  in [f head] <> map f tail
```

Unlike in Haskell, declarations with these patterns cannot appear in dependency cycles, and bound names can only be used in declarations after the one in which they are brought into scope.

### Find record accessors in Type Directed Search

(@kRITZCREEK)

Type-directed search will now include results for record accessors. This can
be very useful when working with extensible records with a type-driven programming
workflow.

### Deriving `Functor`

(@LiamGoodacre, #2515)

The `Functor` type class can now be derived using the standard `derive instance` syntax:

``` purescript
newtype F a = F { foo :: Array a, bar :: a }

derive instance functorF :: Functor F 
```

### User-Defined Kinds

(@LiamGoodacre, #2486)

Custom kinds can now be defined using the `foreign import kind` syntax:

``` purescript
foreign import kind SymbolList
```

Custom kinds can be ascribed to types using `foreign import data` declarations, as usual:

``` purescript
foreign import data Nil :: SymbolList
foreign import data Cons :: Symbol -> SymbolList -> SymbolList
```

Note that kind arguments are not supported.

User defined kinds can be imported/exported using the `kind` prefix, for example: 

``` purescript
import Type.SymbolList (kind SymbolList)
```

### Source Maps in `psc-bundle`

(@nwolverson)

`psc-bundle` will now generate source maps if the`--source-maps` flag is used.

### Solving `CompareSymbol` and `AppendSymbol`

(@LiamGoodacre, #2511)

Support for the new `purescript-typelevel-prelude` library has been added to the compiler. `CompareSymbol` and `AppendSymbol` constraints will now be solved automatically for literal symbols.

### New `psc-package` Features

(@paf31)

Two new commands have been added to `psc-package` to support library authors and package set curators.
- The `updates` command (#2510) is used to update packages in the set.
- The `verify-set` command (#2459) is used to verify the health of a package set. This command replicates the work done by the `package-sets` CI job, and can be used to test modifications to the package set locally before making a pull request.

## Enhancements
- Update orphan instance check to use covering sets when functional dependencies are involved (@LiamGoodacre)
- Add `--node-path` option to PSCi to modify the path to the Node executable (#2507, @paf31)

### Solving `IsSymbol` instances

(@LiamGoodacre)

The compiler will now derive `Data.Symbol.IsSymbol` instances for type-level string literals.

This enables interesting type-level programming features, such as [deriving `Show` instances using `Data.Generics.Rep`](https://asciinema.org/a/1lc5nn3o9b24y2bos8eowmfa9).

### Rows in Instance Heads

(@LiamGoodacre)

The compiler now allows rows to appear in type class instance heads, but only in type arguments which are fully determined by some functional dependency.

This allows instances like

``` purescript
MonadState { field :: Type } MyAppMonad
```

and also `Newtype` instances for newtypes which contain records.

### Speeds up parsing by reading files as Text

(@kRITZCREEK)

The use of `String` has been replaced by `Text` in the compiler, resulting in some non-trivial performance improvements.

### Functional Dependencies in `psc-docs` output

(@soupi, #2439)

`psc-docs` now includes functional dependency information when rendering type classes.

### New `psc-package` Commands
- The `available` command (@andyarvanitis) shows all available packages in the current package set
- The `uninstall` command (@joneshf) removes a package from the set of active packages and updates the package configuration file.

### Type Class Warning (@joneshf)

A warning was added for shadowed type variables in type class declarations.

### Type-directed search (@kRITZCREEK)

This extends the typed holes error messages to include suggested replacements for a typed hole, by using type subsumption to determine which identifiers in scope are appropriate replacements.

A blog post will accompany this feature soon.

### `psc-package` (@paf31)

This is an experimental package manager for PureScript packages. It supports the following commands:
- `init` - create a new project using the package set for the current compiler version
- `update` - sync the local package collection with the package set
- `install` - install a specific package from the current set and add it to the package config
- `build` - run `psc` on any active packages
- `sources` - list source globs for active package versions
- `dependencies` - list transitive dependencies of the current project

For example:

``` text
$ psc-package init
$ psc-package install transformers
$ psc-package build
```

Eventually, `psc-package` might replace the use of Bower, but that will require support from tools like Pulp. For now, package authors should continue to publish packages using Bower and Pursuit.

### `Data.Generic.Rep.Generic` Deriving (@paf31)

This is an alternative generic programming implementation based on `GHC.Generics`. It should allow deriving of more interesting classes, such as `Semigroup`. See the `purescript-generics-rep` package for examples.

4284368,2016-10-02T21:43:43Z,2016-10-02T22:11:48Z,v0.10.1,"## Breaking Changes

The new functional dependencies feature fixes type inference in some cases involving multi-parameter type classes. However, due to a bug in the compiler, some of those expressions were previously type checking where they should not have. As a result, it is necessary to add functional dependencies to some classes in order to make previous code type-check in some cases. Known examples are:
- `MonadEff` and `MonadAff`
- `MonadState`, `MonadReader`, and the rest of the MTL-style classes in `transformers`

## New Features

### `Data.Newtype` Deriving

(@garyb)

It is now possible to derive the `Newtype` class for any data declaration which is a `newtype`, using the existing `deriving instance` syntax:

``` purescript
newtype Test = Test String

derive instance newtypeTest :: Newtype Test _
```

Note that the second type argument should be specified as a wildcard, and will be inferred.

### Added type level string functions

(@FrigoEU)

The `Prim` module now defines the `TypeString` and `TypeConcat` type constructors, which can be used to build more descriptive error messages which can depend on types, using the `Fail` constraint:

``` purescript
instance cannotShowFunctions 
    :: Fail (""Function type "" <> TypeString (a -> b) <> "" cannot be shown."") 
    => Show (a -> b) where
  show _ = ""unreachable""

infixl 6 type TypeConcat as <>
```

### `--dump-corefn`

(@rightfold)

The compiler now supports the `--dump-corefn` option, which causes the functional core to be dumped in `output/**/corefn.json`. This should be useful for implementing new backends which interpret the functional core.

### Newtype Deriving

(@paf31)

It is now possible to derive type class instances for `newtype`s, by reusing the instance for the underlying type:

``` purescript
newtype X = X String

derive newtype instance showX :: Show X
```

Note that it is possible to derive instances for multi-parameter type classes, but the newtype must only appear as the last type argument.

### Allow anonymous accessor chains (`_.a.b`)

(@rvion)

Anonymous record accessor syntax has been extended to work with chains of one or more accessors:

``` purescript
getBaz = _.foo.bar.baz
```

### Functional Dependencies (@paf31)

The type class solver now supports functional dependencies. A multi-parameter type class can define dependencies between its type arguments by using the `->` operator:

``` purescript
class Stream el s | s -> el where
  cons :: el -> (Unit -> s) -> s
  uncons :: s -> { head :: el, tail :: s }
```

Here, the `s` and `el` type arguments are related by a single functional dependency, which ensures that there is at most one instance for any given type `s`. Alternatively, the type `s` _determines_ the type `el`, i.e. there is an implicit function from types `s` to types `el`. This information can be used by the solver to infer types where it was previously not possible.

See the following examples for more information:

### Goto Definition

@kRITZCREEK has added the ability to return position information for expressions in `psc-ide`. This can be used to implement a Goto Definition feature in IDEs which use `psc-ide-server` as the backend.

PSCi now features an alternative backend, which can run commands in the browser via a websocket. To use this mode, simply pass the `--port` option on the command line:

```
$ pulp psci --port 9000

and open your web browser to `localhost` on that port.

3345377,2016-05-31T04:13:59Z,2016-06-01T01:03:48Z,v0.9.1,"PureScript 0.9.1 is a major stable release of the compiler. It removes features which were deprecated in the 0.8.x series, and contains several useful enhancements and bug fixes. 

This release will be accompanied by new releases of the core libraries and a compatible version of Pulp, which have been updated to work with this version. 

Due to the relatively large number of breaking changes, library authors are advised that they will probably need to update their libraries to maintain compatibility. Users may prefer to continue using version 0.8.5 until their dependencies have been updated.

## Breaking Changes

### Name resolving

(@garyb)

The way names are resolved has now been updated in a way that may result in some breakages. The short version is: now only names that have been imported into a module can be referenced, and you can only reference things exactly as you imported them.

Some examples:

| Import statement | Exposed members |
| --- | --- |
| `import X` | `A`, `f` |
| `import X as Y` | `Y.A` `Y.f` |
| `import X (A)` | `A` |
| `import X (A) as Y` | `Y.A` |
| `import X hiding (f)` | `A` |
| `import Y hiding (f) as Y` | `Y.A` |

Qualified references like `Control.Monad.Eff.Console.log` will no longer resolve unless there is a corresponding `import Control.Monad.Eff.Console as Control.Monad.Eff.Console`. Importing a module unqualified does not allow you to reference it with qualification, so `import X` does not allow references to `X.A` unless there is also an `import X as X`.

Although the new scheme is stricter it should be easier to understand exactly what the effect of any given import statement is. The old resolution rules for qualified names were obscure and unexpected results could arise when locally-qualified module names overlapped with ""actual"" module names.

Module re-exports have also been tightened up as a result of these rules. Now if module `X` is only imported `as Y`, the re-export must list `module Y` also. If a module is imported without being re-qualified then the original name is used.

### Partial Constraints

(@garyb, @paf31)

The compiler will now generate an error for a missing `Partial` constraints, where it would previously have issued a warning.

### Module Restrictions

(@garyb, @paf31)
- Imports must now appear before other declarations in a module.
- A source file must now contain exactly one module.

These restrictions will allow us to improve incremental build times in future, since we will only need to parse a small prefix of each file in order to figure out what needs to be rebuilt. Right now, we need to parse every file fully.

### Foreign Function Interface Changes

(@paf31)

Foreign modules are now found by filename rather than by searching for a custom JavaScript comment. The foreign module is found by changing the extension of the corresponding PureScript module from `.purs` to `.js`.

This change was made to be more consistent with `psc-ide`, and also to adopt a simple convention which will port well to other backends.

### Operator Aliases

(@garyb)

All operators must be defined as aliases from now on. That is, it is no longer valid to define an operator as a name in local scope (e.g. `let (#) x y = x y in ...`). This change makes it possible to generate better JavaScript code for operators, by desugaring them to the functions they alias.

### Other
- Deprecated class import/export syntax has been removed (@LiamGoodacre). Classes are now imported using the `class` keyword, and exported similarly:
  
  ``` purescript
  import Prelude (class Show, show)
  ```
- Remove support for `=` in record binders (@paf31).
  
  Record binders such as 
  
  ``` purescript
  f { x = 0 } = true
  ```
  
  are no longer supported. Record binders must now use `:` instead:
  
  ``` purescript
  f { x: 0 } = true
  ```
- `Prim.Object` has been renamed to `Prim.Record` (#1768, @paf31)

## Enhancements

### Programmable Type Errors

(@paf31)

Constraints can now contain type-level strings which can be used as custom error messages using the `Fail` constraint. For example, one can now document the fact that foreign types such as `JSDate` cannot be made instances of `Generic`:

``` purescript
instance dateIsNotGeneric
  :: Fail ""JSDate is not Generic. Consider using Int with toEpochMilliseconds instead.""
  => Generic JSDate where
    fromSpine   = crashWith ""fromSpine: unreachable""
    toSpine     = crashWith ""toSpine: unreachable""
    toSignature = crashWith ""toSignature: unreachable""
```

Attempting to derive a `Generic` instance for a type containing `JSDate` will then result in

``` text
A custom type error occurred while solving type class constraints:

    JSDate is not Generic. Consider using Int with toEpochMilliseconds instead.
```

### Typed Hole Improvements

(#2070, @paf31)

Typed hole error messages now include the types of any names in scope, to assist with type-driven development:

``` text
> :t \x -> maybe 0 ?f x
Error found:
in module $PSCI
at  line 1, column 8 - line 1, column 22

  Hole 'f' has the inferred type

    t0 -> Int

  in the following context:

    it :: Maybe t0 -> Int
    x :: Maybe t0


in value declaration it

where t0 is an unknown type
```

### Editor Support
- The results of the last rebuild are now cached by `psc-ide`, which improves completion support for editor plugins. (@kRITZCREEK)
- A `reset` command was added to `psc-ide` (@kRITZCREEK)
- The compiler will now suggest replacements to address `MissingTypeDeclaration` and `TypeWildCard` warnings (@nwolverson)

### PSCi Improvements

(@paf31)
- The design of PSCi has been changed to improve performance. PSCi now precompiles all dependencies and uses the same incremental rebuilding approach as `psc-ide`. This means that the `:load` and `:foreign` commands have been removed, since dependencies are fixed and pre-compiled when PSCi loads.
- PSCi now supports alternative base libraries such as Neon, by depending on `purescript-psci-support` for its supporting code.

### Colors in Error Messages

Types and values will now be highlighted in error messages, when the terminal supports it (MacOS and Linux for now) (@soupi).

### Type Names

Prime characters are now allowed in type names. (@garyb)

3065661,2016-04-21T03:41:36Z,2016-04-21T04:17:03Z,v0.8.5,"## New Features
- Fast recompilation for single files in `psc-ide-server` #1712 (@kRITZCREEK, @paf31)
  
  The [`pscid`](https://github.com/kRITZCREEK/pscid) project makes use of this to watch files as you work and raise errors and warnings when they occur with near instant feedback.
- Operator aliases can now be declared for types #416 (@garyb)
  
  ``` purescript
  infixr 6 type Natural as ~>
  ```
- Underscore wildcards can now be used in `case` and `if` expressions #1558 (@garyb)
  
  ``` purescript
  case _ of
    Something -> ...
  ```
  
  ``` purescript
  -- underscores can optionally be used in any part of an `if` expression
  cond = if _ then _ else _
  picker = if _ then ""x"" else ""y""
  ```
- Typed holes #1283 (@garyb)
  
  ``` purescript
  example :: forall a. Maybe a -> Unit
  example ma = ?umm
  ```
  
  ```
  Hole 'umm' has the inferred type
  
    Unit
  
  in value declaration example
  ```
  
  You can use any identifier name after the question mark and that will be used to label the hole in the raised error message.

## Breaking changes
- Type annotations may need parentheses in some situations that they previously did not due to the introduction of type operators. For example, `x :: a == y` will be now parsed as `x :: (a == y)` instead of `(x :: a) == y`.

## Enhancements

- We have dropped support for GHC 7.8 and older (@hdgarrood)

## Enhancements
- Infer types with class constraints (@paf31)
  
  For example, this simple code would previously have failed with a confusing `NoInstanceFound` error:
  
  ``` purescript
  add x y = x + y
  ```
  
  The compiler will now infer the most general type, namely `forall a. (Semiring a) => a -> a -> a`.
  
  Note that constraints can only be inferred if they only mention type variables; inference of arbitrary types in constraints is not (yet) supported. So, for example, you would still have to write a type signature for a function which had a constraint such as `(MonadEff (console :: CONSOLE | eff) m)`.
- Default require path to `../` (@nwolverson)
  
  The previous default behavior was no require path prefix, which was confusing for some workflows. The new default is `../`, which is the prefix used in `purs-loader`. This option will be removed completely in 0.9.
- Expose hiding import suggestion in JSON (@nwolverson)
- Error on missing `LICENSE` file or missing license field in `bower.json` (@faineance)

_None_

## Enhancements
- `psc-ide` is now distributed with the compiler! (@kRITZCREEK)
  
  The `psc-ide-server` and `psc-ide-client` executables are now maintained and
  distributed alongside the compiler. This will ensure that the externs file
  format used by `psc-ide-server` is kept in sync with changes in the compiler.
- Source maps (@nwolverson)
  
  Source maps can be generated using the `--source-maps` flag. See the
  [example repository](https://github.com/nwolverson/purescript-sourcemap-test) for a full demonstration of source maps using Webpack.
- Operator aliases for data constructors (@garyb)
  
  Aliases can now be defined for data constructors. For example:
  
  ``` purescript
  data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
  
  infixr 6 Cons as :
  ```
  
  Here, the `:` operator can be used as a function to replace the `Cons` constructor,
  _and also in binders_.
- `Eq` and `Ord` deriving (@paf31)
  
  `Eq` and `Ord` instances can now be derived, using the `derive instance` syntax:
  
  ``` purescript
  derive instance eqList  :: (Eq  a) => Eq  (List a)
  derive instance ordList :: (Ord a) => Ord (List a)
  ```
- Types are now inferred in `psc-docs` and `psc-publish` (@hdgarrood)
  
  If type annotations are missing in source files, they will be inferred by
  `psc-docs` and `psc-publish` before documentation generation.
- Initial version of new syntax for operator sections (#1846, @paf31)
  
  Operator sections can now be written using underscores. For example:
  
  ``` purescript
  decrementAll :: Array Int -> Array Int
  decrementAll = map (_ - 1)
  ```
  
  which is equivalent to:
  
  ``` purescript
  decrementAll :: Array Int -> Array Int
  decrementAll = map (\x -> x - 1)
  ```

## Bug Fixes
- Allow one open import without warning (@garyb)
  
  Warnings for open imports were a pain point for some users after the 0.8 release.
  This change allows a single open import without a warning. This is still safe
  in the presence of dependency updates, and does not lead to ambiguity for editor
  plugins searching for declaration sites.

## Breaking Changes

_None_, but there are lots of new warnings related to upcoming breaking changes in 0.9:
- Operators as aliases will become mandatory, and regular operators (as functions) will now generate warnings.
- Non-exhaustive functions will get a `Partial` constraint in 0.9, so the exhaustivity checker will now attempt to generate warnings by looking for `Partial` constraints in scope.
- The `qualified` import syntax has been deprecated.
- Class imports will use the new `class` syntax in 0.9 and the alternative syntax is deprecated.

This release includes some updates to generic deriving which require updating to the latest version of `purescript-generics`.

## Features
- Field puns, fix #921 (@balajirrao)
  
  It is now possble to construct objects by using values in scope with the same name as the field labels. For example, the expression `{ foo, bar }` is equivalent to `{ foo: foo, bar: bar }`. Patterns desugar in the same way.

## Enhancements

The main focus areas for this release, as part of the 0.8 milestone, were error messages and performance.

## Breaking Changes

_None!_

## Enhancements
- Pretty printing of types and expressions in errors was improved (@paf31)
- Externs files are now saved as JSON (@paf31)
- Support for parallel builds has been added (@paf31)
  Builds will now use multiple cores by default, but the number of capabilities can be modified by passing the `-N` option to the GHC runtime:
  
  ``` text
  psc <input files> +RTS -N8
  ```
- Binders can now be given type annotations (@5outh)
  
  For example:
  
  ``` purescript
  example = do
    n :: Int <- get
    put (n + 1)
  ```
  
  This can be useful when disambiguating types.
- There is a new warning for missing type signatures on top-level declarations (@paf31)
- There are new warnings for shadowed and unused type variables (@garyb)
- Contextual information in warnings was improved (@garyb)
- The `qualified` keyword is now optional when importing modules qualified (@michaelficarra)
- @zudov changed the behavior of PSCi on CTRL+C/D to match GHCi and other REPLs.
- A bug in row unification was fixed (#1310, @paf31)
- Constrained types can now be defined without a `forall` keyword. This is useful in some nullary type class and rank-N scenarios. (@paf31)

## Bug Fixes
- @garyb added some additional checks for transitive module exports.
- Type synonyms are now expanded more eagerly to avoid some error cases in the type checker (@paf31)
- Better support for multi-byte UTF-8 characters (@senju)
- A check has been added to the exhaustivity checker to avoid exponential blowup (@paf31)
- Empty case statements are no longer syntactically valid (@zudov)

## Other
- @aspidites fixed all compiler warnings in the core libraries.
- @zudov and @phadej have made improvements to the Stack distribution of the compiler, and the Stackage builds.
- @garyb has added a warning for operators in type classes, since they will be disallowed before 0.8.

- `psci` would not work due to overlaps in the `PSCI.Support` module
- `free` would not build due to its dependency on `inject`

The solution for now is to make overlapping instances into a _warning_ (instead of an error) at the site of their use.

Later we might revisit this decision and allow the user to express classes like `Inject` which are necessarily overlapping.

1722493,2015-08-25T22:37:45Z,2015-08-25T23:07:05Z,v0.7.4,"## Breaking Changes
- The type class instance search algorithm has changed. The search will now eagerly match an instance for each subgoal based on the instance head, or fail. This makes certain instances in previous versions of `purescript-transformers` invalid, so users of this release should upgrade to the latest `transformers`.
- A module must be imported to be re-exported.

## Enhancements
- `RedefinedModule` errors now include position info #1024 (@garyb)
- Multiple imports of the same module are now resolved correctly, allowing for combinations of qualified and unqualified importing #817 #1112 (@garyb)
- Errors for unresolvable imports and exports have been clarified #1232 (@garyb)
- A warning is emitted when importing `Type(..)` when `Type` is a synonym or has no constructors. #1391 (@garyb)
- Superclass constraints can now be relied upon when resolving instances #421 (@paf31)
- A serious performance regression was partially addressed, memory usage should now be drastically reduced #1297 (@garyb)
- Module re-export handling has been much improved. If a module is partially imported, only the specifically imported members are re-exported. Qualified modules can also be re-exported. #291 #1244 (@garyb)
- Parser error messages are now formatted in a manner more consistent with other errors #1098 (@epost)
- Using `-ffi` to specify JavaScript FFI files is now optional, files with a `.js` extension will be detected as FFI files automatically when encountered. #1268 (@mjgpy3)

## Bug fixes
- Fixed an error when attempting to derive for `Void` #1380 (@nicodelpiano)
- `""The impossible happened in desugarDo""` should no longer occur #386 (@paf31)

- @gbaz has implemented **generic deriving**. This allows instances for the `Generic` class in the `purescript-generics` package to be derived by the compiler.
  
  A `Generic` instance can be derived as follows:
  
  ``` purescript
  data Example = Foo String | Bar Int | Baz Boolean
  
  derive instance genericExample :: Generic Example
  ```
  
  `purescript-generics` provides examples of usage, such as `gShow`, `gEq` and `gCompare`, for printing, equality tests and comparison respectively.
  
  See #1138.
- @garyb has implemented a test for **orphan instances** which will now cause the build to fail with an error. See #1247

## Enhancements
- @mjgpy3 has added a warning when an input glob does not match any files.

## Bug Fixes
- The `psc: <<loop>>` has been fixed. This was due to a bug in the error pretty printer. (@paf31)
- An issue with unicode characters in string literals was fixed by @michaelficarra.
- Compiler errors are now pretty printed in `psc-publish` (@paf31)
- Modules are no longer linted if they are not being rebuilt (@paf31)
- FFI bindings are now reloaded when changed, in PSCi (@paf31)

## Other
- @phadej and @zudov have improved our CI process, so that PureScript now compiles against three versions of GHC and two LTS Stackage releases, as well as the nightly stackage releases.
- @phadej and @lukerandall have worked on supporting PureScript in Stackage.

This release (""MELTDOWN"") aims to handle as many planned breaking changes as possible, to ease the upgrade path before 1.0. It is necessary to upgrade almost all PureScript code to compile with this release. 

The latest versions of the core libraries have all been updated to compile with this release. Older versions of the core libraries will not work with this release, and the latest versions of libraries will not build with older compiler releases.

Detailed instructions for those who need to migrate their code can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/wiki/0.7-Migration-Guide).

As usual, many thanks go to all of the contributors who helped with this release!

## Breaking changes
- The `psc` executable has been replaced with `psc-make`, which has been renamed to `psc` (in an effort to standardize on CommonJS module output). Features which were previously only available in old `psc` (dead code elimination, bundling code for the browser) are now handled by the new executable `psc-bundle`, which works with the output of the new `psc` (for faster, incremental builds).
- There are now `Int` and `Number` literals. To disambiguate the two, integer `Number` values must now be written with a decimal place (`3.0` rather than `3`).
- The `Prelude` module is no longer imported automatically, and must be imported the same way as any other module.
- No modules are included with the compiler now, they have been broken out into their own libraries:
  - [purescript-prelude](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-prelude)
  - [purescript-eff](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-eff)
  - [purescript-st](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-st)
  - [purescript-console](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-console)
  - [purescript-functions](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-functions)
- `Debug.Trace` has been renamed to `Control.Monad.Eff.Console`, and `trace` has been renamed to `log`.
- `[]` syntax for array types has been removed. It is still possible to use `[]` array literals however.
  - `[]` should now be written as `Array`, and `[a]` as `Array a`.
- Cons patterns for arrays have been removed.
- Declaring operators in classes will now produce a warning. Changes will be coming to operators in PureScript 0.8, and moving to named members in classes with operators as aliases (e.g. `(<$>) = map`) should make the transition easier in the future.
- JavaScript for the FFI can no longer be provided inline.
  - Values must instead be provided in a separate `.js` file, and passed to the compiler with the `-ffi` flag.
  - Values should be provided in the form `exports.foo = ...`, similar to a CommonJS module
  - The file should have a comment `// module X.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` is the name of the module the JS values are for.
  - [See here for an example](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-eff/blob/v0.1.0-rc.1/src/Control/Monad/Eff.js)

## Enhancements
- Module exports (@andyarvanitis). Currently, only full module exports are supported, but imported modules can be re-exported using the following syntax:
  `purescript
  module M1 (module M2) where
  import M2
  `
- Documentation improvements (@hdgarrood):
  - `psc-docs` can now generate multiple output files, allowing documentation to be collected into functional groups.
  - A new tool `psc-publish` has been added, which generates module documentation in a JSON format required by Pursuit 2 (coming soon)
- @hdgarrood has worked on improving the quality of code completion inside `psci`, and generally tidying up and refactoring that code.
- @puffnfresh has worked on dramatically increasing the performance of incremental builds, with improvements up to 10x compared to the previous release.
- The new `--require-path` option allows the syntax of module imports in generated CommonJS modules to be customized (@garyb).
- @etrepum has added support for building with Stack.
- PSCi now supports computations in the `Eff` monad. (@paf31)
- The compiler now emits warnings in the following cases:
  - Operator name used in type class definition (@garyb)
  - Type wildcard used (@nicodelpiano)
  - Shadowed variable name (@paf31)
- @balajirrao has improved the appearance of unknown and rigid types appearing in error messages.
- @puffnfresh has added position information to pattern match errors.
- @puffnfresh has added some new optimizations (inlining `<<<` and `$`)

## Bug Fixes
- `psc`, `psc-docs` and `psc-bundle` now support file globs as command-line arguments, fixing a bug related to the command length on Windows machines (@paf31)
- @wuzzeb has fixed some issues in the pretty printer.
- @mjgpy3 has improved error messages related to incorrect pattern matches on data constructors.

## Tools
- Pulp has been updated:
  - The new `psc` and `psc-bundle` binaries are supported
  - FFI modules are now identified and compiled based on a convention
  - `pulp docs` now generates individual Markdown files for each source module
- `gulp-purescript` has been updated:
  - The new `psc` and `psc-bundle` binaries are supported
  - FFI modules are now supported

## Libraries
- The following libraries have been moved into the core library set:
  - `purescript-lists` - Strict and lazy linked list data structures
  - `purescript-assert` - Low level assertion library for tests
  - `purescript-parallel` - An applicative functor for parallel composition of asynchronous computations.
  - `purescript-arrows` - Arrow type classes and standard instances.
  - `purescript-tailrec` - A type class for stack-safe monadic tail recursion.
- The requirements for libraries in the `purescript-contrib` organization [have been tightened](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/wiki/Contrib-Guidelines), to try to ensure that libraries stay maintained.

## Documentation
- The Prelude now has Markdown documentation (various contributors - thank you!)
- The [Pursuit](http://pursuit.purescript.org) website has been updated with new versions of libraries, including Markdown documentation (@hdgarrood)

## Libraries
- The following libraries are now core libraries:
  - `purescript-tailrec` - A type class for monadic tail recursion
  - `purescript-monad-eff` - A type class for monads supporting native effects
  - `purescript-integers` - Integer numeric type
  - `purescript-invariant` - Invariant functors
  - `purescript-parallel` - An applicative functor for parallel composition of asynchronous computations

## Other
- There is an experimental C++11 backend for PureScript called [pure11](https://github.com/andyarvanitis/pure11).

- The `Num` type class has been refined to allow more interesting instances. The `Semiring`, `ModuloSemiring`, `Ring` and `DivisionRing` classes have been introduced. Most code should continue to compile, since `Number` was one of only a handful of instances, but library developers will need to break up their `Num` instances.

## Enhancements
- @garyb has improved the readability of `psc-docs` output.

## Notes
- All uses of the deprecated `ErrorT` have been replaced with `ExceptT` and the `transformers` and `mtl` dependencies bumped accordingly.

### Scoped Type Variables

(#347, @paf31)

This feature allows type variables which are bound by a `forall` keyword to be used inside type annotations in the body of the function. For example, suppose we want to define a `map` function on a `List` type:

``` purescript
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)

map :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
map f = go
  where
  go Nil = Nil
  go (Cons x xs) = Cons (f x) (map f xs) 
```

To give a type to `go`, we could previously use type wildcards:

``` purescript
go :: List _ -> List _
```

Now, we can refer to the types `a` and `b` inside the type of `go`, giving a more precise type:

``` purescript
go :: List a -> List b
```

### Rows In Instance Contexts

(@paf31, @apsk)

This feature allows rows to appear on the left of a `=>` in a type signature. For example, given a `MonadEff` class:

``` purescript
class MonadEff eff m where
  liftEff :: forall a. Eff eff a -> m a
```

we can now write the following function which works in any `Monad` supporting `Trace` actions:

``` purescript
logging :: forall m a eff. (Monad m, MonadEff (trace :: Trace | eff) m) => String -> m a -> m a
logging s action = do
  liftEff $ trace $ ""Starting: "" <> s
  a <- action
  liftEff $ trace $ ""Done: "" <> s
  return a
```

### Improved `let` bindings in `psci`

(#782, @paf31)

Any declaration can now be used inside a `let` binding in `psci`. For example, we can define data types or foreign imports:

``` text
> let data Foo = Foo | Bar | Baz

> let foreign import foo :: Foo -> String
```

The general form of a `let` statement in `psci` now contains one or more declarations of any type, and these declarations simply get added to the current module.

As a bonus, polymorphic functions bound using `let` now work at multiple type instantiations in `psci`:

``` text
> let f x = x

> if f true then f ""true"" else f ""False""
""true""
```

### Markdown Support in `psc-docs`

(#802, @paf31)

Markdown can now be used for documentation purposes by using pipe characters to align content. For example:

``` purescript
-- | Create a copy of the array without its first element.
-- |
-- | Running time: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
-- |
-- | This function is partial. Specifically, `tail []` is undefined.
tail :: forall a. [a] -> [a]
```

`psc-docs` will insert this markdown content verbatim into your generated documentation.

## Bug Fixes

- `@` is a valid operator name again (#815, @paf31)

291232,2014-04-27T18:28:25Z,2014-04-27T19:16:48Z,"v0.5.0 - ""Polymorph""","### Breaking Changes
- Support for blocks has been removed. (paf31)
- Type class instances must now be named (paf31)
  
  ```
  instance showNumber :: Show Number where
    ...
  ```
- Prelude modules now follow a naming scheme similar to haskell (e.g. `Data.Maybe`, `Control.Monad`) (garyb)
- Many modules that were previously part of the Prelude have been split into individual libraries, [now distributed via Bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=purescript) (garyb)
- Multiple modules with the same name are now disallowed rather than merged (garyb)
- The `Prelude` module is now imported automatically. Conflicts can be avoided by using qualified imports or an explicit import list. (garyb, paf31)
- Overlapping instances are no longer allowed. The `Prelude` and core libraries have been updated accordingly. (paf31)
- `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad` are now part of a class heirarchy that include `Apply` and `Bind`. `return` is now an alias for `pure`. (joneshf, paf31, garyb)
- `Semigroupoid` is now a superclass of `Category` (garyb)
- `(:)` is now part of Prelude (garyb)
- `(!!)` has been renamed to `Prelude.Unsafe.unsafeIndex` and a safe version has been added to `Data.Array` (garyb)

### New Features
- Multi parameter typeclasses (paf31)
- Superclasses (puffnfresh, paf31)
- FlexibleInstances and FlexibleContexts (paf31)
- Let bindings are now supported. The `let` keyword can introduce several local (possibly mutually recursive) bindings, along with optional type signatures. (paf31)
- `where` clauses are now supported in value declarations, with the same rules as `let` bindings (garyb)
- Empty data declarations and empty type classes are now supported (paf31)
- A new command line option `--codegen` controls which modules will have Javascript and externs generated (paf31)
- `psc-make` now generates CommonJS-compatible modules, which can be used with `require()` in `node`. `psc` still generates modules for use in the browser. (paf31, garyb)

### Enhancements
- Pretty printing for row types was improved (garyb)
- Module names can now contain `.` (garyb)
- New optimizer rules have been added for code in the ST monad, to reproduce the functionality of the blocks feature, which has been removed (paf31)
- Pattern binders are now usable in lambda expression arguments (paf31)
- PSCI now has a `:t` command for checking the type of a value (paf31)
- Array pretty printing via `show` has been improved (joneshf)
- PSCI completions are sorted (joneshf)
- PSCI now has help commands (joneshf)
- PSCI history is in XDG config (joneshf)
- PSCI allows loading of modules from ~ paths (joneshf)
- PSCI can accept a list of modules to load on start from the command line (paf31)
- PSCI can now be configured using a `.psci` file in the current directory. If such a file exists, it should contain a list of commands to run on startup. (paf31)
- Type class instances are now named, to enable easier interop with Javascript (paf31)
- Class names no longer need to be qualified in instance declarations (garyb)
- Module exports can now be specified explicitly (garyb)
- Let bindings can now define functions with binders (paf31)
- Case statements and functions which do not pattern match on their arguments now generate smaller code (paf31)
- Imported type class instances are now exported (paf31)
- Some error messages were improved (paf31)
- Qualfied module imports are now supported as `import qualified M as X` (garyb)
- The escape check was removed, since it was too restrictive (paf31)
- The binary operator reordering step was greatly simplified (paf31)
- The Object type constructor can now be referenced explicitly as `Prim.Object` (with kind `# * -> *`) (paf31)
- Optimizations are now enabled by default and can be disabled with the `--no-tco` and `--no-magic-do` flags (garyb) 
- Unary minus and signed numeric literals are now supported again (paf31, garyb)
- Type errors have been simplified, the full trace can be enabled with `--verbose-errors` or `-v` (paf31)
- Error messages now display source positions (paf31, garyb)
- The type classes implementation and code generation was greatly simplified (paf31)
- Object properties and row labels can now be accessed with arbitrary string names by using string literals (paf31)
- `(++)` is now an alias for the Semigroup operator `(<>)` (paf31)
- Error messages for classes with undefined or missing members have been improved (garyb)
- The SYB dependency was removed, and traversals rewritten by hand, for a large performance increase (paf31)

### Bug Fixes
- The subsumes relation has been fixed for object types (paf31)
- `sort` no longer mutates arrays (joneshf)
- PSCI now evaluates expressions (joneshf)
- Overlapping variables in typeclass instances are rejected (paf31)
- A bug in the optimizer related to inlining was fixed (paf31)
- A type checker bug related to array literals was fixed (paf31)
- Externs files (`--externs`) are now working again (paf31)
- Precedence of backticked infix functions have been corrected (paf31)
- A bug which allowed some incorrect type class instances to pass the type checker was fixed (paf31)
- Type synonyms are no longer restricted to kind `*` (paf31)
- Negative number literals have been restored (garyb)
- If a type defined in a module appears in an exported declaration it must also be exported from the module (garyb)
- Error messages for unresolvable types or values include the declaration name again (garyb)
- Characters in string literals are now properly escaped (garyb)
- A module containing a single orphan type declaration and no other declarations now fails to compile (garyb)
- An error involving ordering of type class instances was fixed (garyb, paf31)
- Externs files no longer include fixity declarations for members that were removed as dead code (garyb)
- A bug which prevented `sequence $ [Just 1]` from typechecking was fixed (paf31)

### Libraries
- Purescript libraries are now [distributed via Bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=purescript). There are currently around 40 libraries available.

### Plugins
- The `grunt-purescript` plugin has been updated to provide support for new command line options.
- There is a new `gulp-purescript` plugin available for compiling with Gulp.

### Documentation
- There is a new `hierarchy` executable which will generate `.dot` diagrams based on the type class hierarchy of a module. The Prelude docs have been updated to include such a type class diagram. (joneshf)
