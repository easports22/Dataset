- TriggerBuilder implementations and JobBuilder should now be used to create different job and trigger definitions
- Introduced IJobDetail, IContrigger, ISimpleTrigger, ICalendarIntervalTrigger have far less members and especially mutators
- When C5 collections were introduced as set-based implementation provider, ISet and ISortedSet interfaces were narrowed (IList inheritance removed)

POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGES (since 2.0 beta 2)

Custom IJobFactory implementations now need to implement new method void ReturnJob(IJob job) for container managed cleanup.
NthIncludedDayTrigger was removed as it was accidentally left behind even though being legacy and replaced by DailyTimeIntervalTrigger.

NEW FEATURES
- TimeZone support for calendars / Andrew Smith
- Allow scheduling relative to replaced trigger with XML configuration
- Add method to IJobFactory to destroy a job instance created by the factory breaking / minor breaking, added new required method
- Internalize C5 dependency
- Support for Oracle ODP 11.2 Release 4
- Upgrade SQLite dependency to version 1.0.83
- Upgrade to Common.Logging 2.1.2

FIXES
- Scheduled Shutdown blocked even if waitForJobsToComplete is false
- DailyTimeIntervalTriggerImpl should be serializable
- InstanceID = ""AUTO"" may cause ""String or binary data would be truncated"" error on qrtz_fired_triggers.entry_id
- PlugInExample doesn't execute any jobs
- Recovering triggers have empty/incorrect JobDataMap
- Make Quartz.NET work under medium trust when running .NET 3.5
- tables_oracle.sql uses deprecated VARCHAR type
- Improve error reporting for database connection failure
- Scheduler Shutdown Freezes when There are Jobs Still Running
- Use System.Version instead of FileVersionInfo to retive current Quartz version
- DailyTimeIntervalTriggerImpl Validate broken

BREAKING CHANGES
- Remove NthIncludedDayTrigger that was supposed to be removed in 2.0 breaking
- Remove Visual Studio 2008 solutions and projects breaking
- Add support for DateTimeOffset and TimeSpan to JobDataMap / minor breaking - cleanup of API

UPGRADING 

Database schema upgrade is needed from 2.x series to 2.2: 
- SQL Server: alter table QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS add SCHED_TIME [BIGINT] NOT NULL; 
- MySQL: alter table QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS add SCHED_TIME BIGINT(19) NOT NULL 
- Oracle: alter table QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS add SCHED_TIME NUMBER(19) NOT NULL 
- this adds a new column SCHED_TIME to table QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS 

BREAKING CHANGES 
- database schema needs upgrade 
- add SchedulerStarting() method to ISchedulerListener interface 
- make the scheduler's TypeLoadHelper available to plugins when they are initialized 
- dbFailureRetryInterval parameter was removed from DirectSchedulerFactory APIs 

NEW FEATURES 
- ability to override worker thread names (when using SimpleThreadPool) 
- add new IScheduler method: ScheduleJob(IJobDetail job, ISet trigger) to schedule multiple triggers for a job all at once 
- allow 'triggerless' initial storing of non-durable jobs. 
- improvements for job recovery information 
- package job_scheduling_data_2_0.xsd to nuget package's content folder 
- allow scheduler exported with remoting to be used from local machine only 
- support for Oracle managed ODP driver 

FIXES 
- job ending with exception and trigger not going to fire again, trigger is incorrectly not removed from job store 
- XML schema supports multiple schedule elements but processor does not 
- DailyTimeIntervalTriggerPersistenceDelegate does not handle empty time interval properly 
- DailyTimeIntervalScheduleBuilder.EndingDailyAfterCount(...) doesn't pass validation 
- trace throwing exception 
- bug in QuartzSchedulerThread.GetRandomizedIdleWaitTime() 
- can't delete or replace job without the referenced class 

MISC 
- Performance improvements, including improvements to some select statements in AdoJobStore
