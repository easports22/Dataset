This release became our pain in some parts of the body and a huge win. Thanks to condret, alvaro and maskray the long term refactoring on top of the simple IO library (siol) is now merged, tested and everything is rewritten on top of this layer. This simplified internal representation of many operations, proving stacked, multi-layered IO for any part of radare2.

## New commands

- A lot of commands were merged together
- Some commands have been added to ease the manipulation of ascii-graphs
- Regularely used analysis macro have been moved into commands to make them easier to use
- Add new command `aesb`, to step back with ESIL (#8052)
- Enhance ax, axk lists and axq is the old ax
- Implement rafind2 -i to identify binaries


## New Fileformats/io plugins

* ar://
* lib://
* winedbg://

## New config options

- Add io.map and remove file and io.maps.range search.in options
- Add asm.asciidot and remove asm.strenc
- io.maps is now by default instead of search.in=file
- Add `asm.addrbytes` eval config var to make one vaddr unit use more than 1 bytes (#8121)
- Bring back `dbg.trace.inrange` in `dtc` command
- Remove `search.count` in favor of `search.maxhits` in `/A` , `/R` , and everywhere else


## Dependencies updates

- Update spp again for windows this time
- Use [libtool]( https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/ ) instead of [ranlib](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/ranlib.html) for iOS
- Update sdb
- Upgrade zlib from 1.2.8 to 1.2.11


## Improved interface

- Fix overlap in graphs
- Added curved corners in the ASCII graph (e scr.utf8.curvy=true)
- Add some options to the search command (`/`), and improve its speed drastically in certain cases
- `r2 -e cfg.newtab=1` to enable the experimental new command completion
- Show hidden metadata as ""hidden"" (#8525)


## Improved disassembly

- Pseudo-decompiler for AVR and SH4
- Add instruction descriptions from Intel Instruction Set Reference Volume 2 (#8209)

## Analysis

- Reduce the number of false positive strings
- Add more analisys heuristics
- Do not let pdf work on functions with > 4KB of unrelated code
- Enhance `aav` for MIPS, `af@@aav*` may be added at some point
- Initial ESIL support for V850
- Avoid dupes in `anal.jmptbl` for analysis, speedup
- `asm.strenc` guess whether string is `utf32le`, `utf16le`, `utf8`, etc

## Fileformat supports

- Add IA-64 binary detection (#8645)
- Add HP-UX binary detection (#8644)
- Detect kotlin in java classes
- Initial optimization for DEX
- Big improvements for MDMP plugin (`r2pm -i mdmp`)
- Added resources extraction to rabin2 (#7912)
- Honor bin.dbginfo for all file formats
- Add DEX38 support
- Add LC_CODE_SIGNATURE for `rabin2 -H` on mach0 bins
- Add canary detection on OpenBSD binaries

### ELF

- Handle .bss section in ELF
- Add V850 recognition

## Bindings
- Add more extern ""C"" to make C++ users happy
- Even more commands have a `json` output now (just append `j` to them.)
- Expose r2 environment variables to internal r2pipe calls
- Add `free` to RLibStruct & RLibPlugin. (#7991)
- Updated lang-python and it allows to create RCore, RAsm and RAnal plugins

## Misc cool stuff

- Add zsh completion for every r2 tool!
- Add support for architectures that are using 9bit bytes middle endian (like CLemenCy)
- Add support for [IDA FLIRT signatures v10](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/index.shtml) (IDA 6.8 and higher)
- Detect `main()` for D language
- Added autoload of zignatures from zigns folder
- Replace radiff2 -s with [Eugene W. Myers' O(ND) diff](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2017/02/12/the-myers-diff-algorithm-part-1/) algorithm
- Add `radiff2 -ss` for [Levenshtein edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
- More documentation
- Less crashes, less memory consumed
- Various fixes regarding projects (removing functions after loading a project is now working)
- As usual, new fortunes

## Debugger

- Add heap [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/) analysis
- Add timeless debugger (Record and Replay) for native debug, gdb:// and ESIL emulation !!!
- Add commands to manage recorded trace sessions
- Add initial support for **hw watchpoint** (#8132)
- Better LLDB support
- Windows: PDB Autoloading when debugging
- Support spawning processes with spaces in their path
- Add the `null` debugger plugin
- added `=!detach` to detatch de debuggee

### GDB
- Reading xml target description and parsing into r2 reg profile (#8124)
- Added reading of executed file name to gdbserver
- Add env var to control gdb packet size
- Added automatic loading of symbols from local file (#8006)
- Added debugging of protocol messages in gdbserver (#7931)

7003194,2017-07-11T15:54:22Z,2017-07-11T18:17:29Z,radare2-1.6 aka Digital Lettuce,"This release comes with major improvements in GDB Client/Server, Windows support, timeless debugger and many stability bugfixes. Also adds support for PPC VLE, Ethereum Virtual Machine, workaround to properly configure the disassembler on PlayStation2 ELFs and added support for the Hexagon CPU.

Strings displayed in the disassembly are now more readable and support multiple encodings, utf32 has been added, as well as latin1, utf8 and asciidot. So rabin2 -z will catch wide32 strings too!

Thanks to the GSoC guys we get:

* Windows: many stability fixes, msvc builds automated on each commit, installed done, a new command allows to grab all PDB from all linked libraries at runtime of any process and load the symbols into the disassembly.
* GDBserver support works, you can use r2 as a gdbserver, but also, many bugs has been fixed to support remote gdb-avr, arm and arm64, so you can now debug the Riscure crackmes without depending on GDB, and also natively debug Android apps thru the gdbserver protocol.
* New mechanisms for storing the debugger backstep snapshots is making it backstep much faster by using checksumming and storing diffing changesets instead of full dumps for each step. Better integration with the tracing commands of r2.

## New commands

* Replaced `aea` with `aea*` 
* Replaced `dh` for `dL` (#7682)

* Implemented `axq` to list refs in quiet/human-readable format
* Implemented `/ra` and fixed `/re` without arguments to find ALL references
* Implemented `|T` to pipe to the `scr.tts` engine
* Implemented `s==` to show flag names, not just offsets
* Implemented `ecH` for instruction highlighting support (#7741)
* Implemented `!-` and `!-*` commands to clear command history
* Implemented `sj` to retrive seek history in json format (#7663)

This release characterised with a big amount of various bug fixes, analysis
improvements and ESIL improvements. You can use meson build system to build
radare2 much faster than using old makefiles buildsystem.
Moreover the first batch of GSoC
patches landed in it - basic timeless debugging support, msvc build
(using both cccl and meson) and improvements of GDB client.
Good news - radare2 now has support for compile-time localization.
Embedded languages are: English, Catalan

WASM
-------

WebAssembly or wasm is a safe, efficient and portable low-level bytecode format for in-browser client-side scripting (though can be also used in non-web environments). WASM is an open standard currently under development by the W3C. Its initial aim is to support compilation from C and C++, though other source languages such as Rust are also supported.

Current version is 0x1 (https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/d9bff35e1389ba11c98ccee8cde72bb2f30e922c/BinaryEncoding.md). Bin support aims to be more flexible than the spec and current implementations, for example, it allows disordered and repeated sections, and tries to keep parsing after an invalid section is fou",https://api.github.com/users/radare,917142,radare,https://api.github.com/repos/radare/radare2/releases/6111396/assets,https://api.github.com/repos/radare/radare2/releases/6111396,master,https://api.github.com/repos/radare/radare2/tarball/1.4.0,https://github.com/radare/radare2/releases/tag/1.4.0,https://api.github.com/repos/radare/radare2/zipball/1.4.0,1.4.0,False,False

radare2 1.1.0 comes with moret han 300 commits which are about 8583 new lines of features, bug fixes and enhancements. Most of this work has focused on bugfixing, the most commited modules are Core, Anal and Bin, but there have been lot of commits in other parts in Asm, Hash, Debug, .. Several bugs has been fixed fixed, so it is heavily recomended to update to the last release or use r2 from git directly.

One of the biggest addition for this release is a preprocessor for `ragg2` and `rasm2` (its replacement, `spp`, is slowly moving forward), and some cleanup of radare2 sources. A long requested feature, recursive help, has been implemented: you can now get help for every single command with the `?*` command.

Nodes in the graphs can be individually folded in the graphs, and asm.cmtright=0 disasm has been greatly improved to make graphs more readable.

There are also news in other repositores. r2k-linux has finally been merged in radare2-extras and it's available via r2pm. Remember that this kernel interface is working on Linux, Android and Windows (32, 64), support for XNU (OSX/iOS) is welcome.

radare2 1.0 comes with `20122` new lines of new features, bug fixes and enhancements. Here some of the most important highlights:

The project have finally reached 1.0. What does it mean?

It means that 10 years have passed and the ecosystem changed enough since its inception that it requires a new rethink of the versioning numbers.

Pushing a new release every 6 weeks, increasing 0.1. And adding +1.0 after every r2con. The 3rd version number will be used in case of emergency because of a buggy release or a backported security fix. In this case a +0.0.1 will be released.

The community evolves in a pretty healthy way, and contributors come and leave over time. This release conforms the base for the future of radare, providing a more structured and predictible evolution of features and apis.

In addition. The r2pipe bindings proved to be more than enough for most needs of our users, more stable, available on more languages and faster than the native bindings. So this is the recommended way to script r2 or write tools that interact with it.

Language bindings will be still maintained, but it requires some focus, which is actually low, in the sense that I'm just fixing when the build breaks.

**--pancake**

## Major contributors
- **pancake** keeps owning > 50% of the commits
- **alvarofe** major contributor, bugfixer
- **mrmacete** implemented the long-standing need of recursive emulation support
- **killabytenow** kept pushing nice AVR ESIL updates
- **Unlogic** focused in RAsm
- **maijin** for remembering all the issues and mangling the testsuite
- **h4ng3r** worked on fixing bugs in the bin+anal of android apps
- **sre** for coming back from debian land

## Known Bugs
- **Slow on big files** - after analyzing a big file (>1MB) the visual mode can become pretty slow, this can be ""optimized"" by disabling asm.slow, but it must be approached in a proper way to avoid O(n) requests to Flags, Functions, Basic blocks and other information that is requested many times.
- **Project structure has changed**, they are upgraded when saved, but there must happen some data loss. Next releases should improve on that.
- **Collisions** in hashtable - some very rare situtations may lead to a hash collision, this is fixed in another branch that updates Sdb, but it's not stable enough to be merged.
- **Debugger** is working but could be much better, the main issue is actually the regression test. You may want to use [r2frida](https://github.com/nowsecure/r2frida) or [r2lldb](https://github.com/nowsecure/r2lldb) from [NowSecure](https://www.nowsecure.com/) to debug with r2 when r2 is not enough.
- **Binary headers** are not easy to visualize or patch, there are tools for doing that, but next releases will make this situation better.
- **Signature matching** is not working as good as it shuold, new signature definitions will appear in the next release, as well as some enhancements and speedups.

## Changes:

This release focused on improving the speed and memory footprint of radare2, 
along with code cleanup. Also, this release comes with a completely reworked
[r2pm](https://github.com/radare/radare2-pm) package manager. A lot of changes have happened in the debugger implementation, and in ESIL emission.

# New commands
- `fi[jn*]` to list _flags_ in a given range
- `pdaj` and `pda=` to disassemble all possible opcodes, byte per byte.
- `drp.` to show the register profile size
- `ecoj`  to list themes in JSON format
- [`pf [size]D`](https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues/5063)
- `aoe` and `aor` to show _ESIL_ and _REIL_ forms of the current opcode
- `ah.` to show _hints_ of the current offset
- `afv[bsr]` to manipulate args, registers and variables in function
- `wxs` to write hexpairs, and seek to the end
- `dpc` to select the most recently forked child process
- `dpc*` to show the recently forked process pid.
- `ecc [arg]` shows color palete with a css syntax
- `pch` for a 2 byte C dump mode
- `@o` is a new modifier to temporary switch to another _fd_
- Adds `core.iorw` in `i` 
- Renaming `afa`, `afv` and `afe` to `afvb`, `afvr`, and `afvs` respectively
- Refactor `pia`/`pda`
- Adds `anal.vars` variable to toggle variables analysis
- `r2 -I` for pre-scripting
- `aa` is now equivalent `af@@ sym.*;af@entry0;afCa` (can you guess what it does?)
- Added cursor to undo seek history
- Implement `afbr` and `*` sub-variants to list return addresses of current function

# Analysis

Now r2 is able to load PE files that has been tampered somehow to thwart the analysis. If radare2 struggles with some samples, feel free to share them with us ;): 
    \* Add name to section when is empty
    \* comment out hackaround for huge number of sections
- Update syscall table for iOS
- Adds output ports for [AVR Atmel8A](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-8159-8-bit-AVR-microcontroller-ATmega8A_summary.pdf). Thanks @radare and @oddcoder
- Implement RSyscall.IO in disasm loop for X86 and AVR
- [Improving](https://gitlab.com/radare/radare2/issues/5146) variables on ARM (16, 32, 64)
- Adds `asm.hints` and handle `CDOV` deoptimization
- Possibility to add comment for var/args
- Add `anal.vinfun` and `anal.anal.vinfunrange` for `aav` (only grab values outside function boundaries)
- Improving the json format for args/vars
- Initial import of the `bin.avr` plugin for atmega8 chips
- Fix analysis and add ESIL for avr's `rjmp`
- Support `op->family` and some `op->cycle` for `anal.arm64`
- Add `MJMP` optype, `pxt` command and enhance `anal.jmptbl` for x86-64 (wip)
- Fixed order of arguments in ESIL representation of `MUL`.
- `afbr`'s description wasn't worded properly: It doesn't actually print addresses of `ret` instructions, but of instructions which cause the flow of the program to leave the function body, like `call`, `jmp`, `hlt`, ...
- `CDIV` deoptimization is now showed as hint

# Debugger
- Improved support of Linux, Android and *BSD systems
- Major rework to the native debugger (especially on Linux) 
- Generate coredump - added support for threads and x86
- Make `dbt` output aligned to columns based on `dbg->bits`
- Breakpoints should now work regardless of the `swtep` setting
- Fix build for Linux <= 2.6.32 (coredump not supported)
- Make [`dm` work](https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues/5267) on OpenBSD by adding a native `_debug_native_map_alloc()`
- Add support for `dp` and `dp*` on OpenBSD.
- Don't print SIGTRAP signals or stops
- Adds breakpoints into project file
- Add ""clone"" to the ""dcf"" command (#5161)
- Track how the caller wishes to continue
- Handle EXIT_PID events differently than DEAD process events
- Move breakpoint/recoil handling to wait/cont/step
- Change many wait functions to return RDebugReasonType
- Better return checking (from `r_debug_reg_sync`, `r_bp_restore`)
- Optimized register synchronization
- Improved inferior death detection

# Assembler/Disassembler
- Add basic support for N64 RSP processor.
- Lot of updates in x86.nz:
  - The `sil`, `dil`, `spl`, and `bpl` registers are now supported
  - `lfence`, `mfence`, `sfence` , `bt`, `fsincos` instructions
  - support syntax for `add eax, [ecx]` and `add ecx, [eba +/- 3]`
  - Add support for immediate word for `sub` 
  - `nz` now generates the correct opcode when using a word as an immediate in the `sub` instruction with a `register + offset` as the target
  - Adds support for word register offsets and refactors that portion of the code a little
  - Add offset support to `add` instruction
- Initial implementation of `asm.assembler` to select different assembler plugin than the disasmembly one

# DEX

[DEX](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/dex-format.html) stands for _Dalvik Executable format_, it's the format used by Android binaires.
- Show _classname_ for static methods in DEX
- Fix imports and enhance parsing virtual methods in DEX
- Better names for virtual Dalvik methods

2714246,2016-02-29T21:59:35Z,2016-02-29T22:34:45Z,solid chair society,"# radare2 0.10.1 - Release Notes

Six weeks ago, when our great leader pancake announced ""a release every 6 weeks"", everyone was a bit, well, [surprised](https://twitter.com/r2gif/status/693462019610132480), but it seems that we did it.

But first, some numbers:
- Codename: `solid chair society`
- Weeks: 6
- Commits: ~280
- Issues Fixed: 50
- Contributors: 38
- New contributors: 10
- New easter-eggs: 1

This 0.10.1 release pushes other updates for:
- [sdb](http://radare.org/get/sdb-0.10.1.tar.gz)
- [acr](http://radare.org/get/acr-0.10.1.tar.gz)
- [radare2](http://radare.org/get/radare2-0.10.1.tar.xz)
- [radare2-bindings](http://radare.org/get/radare2-bindings-0.10.1.tar.xz)
- [radare2-extras](http://radare.org/get/radare2-extras-0.10.1.tar.xz)

Also binary builds for [Windows](http://radare.org/get/pkg/radare2-w32-0.10.1.zip) and [OSX](http://radare.org/get/pkg/radare2-0.10.1.pkg) are also available.

This is great, since it means that our downstream people who puts radare2 into package manager will be able to push updates quicker (yes, I'm looking at you, [debian](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/radare2)).

This also means more release party, which is a good thing. There wasn't an special focus on anything during that last 6 weeks, but if I had to comment on this release, I would say that its theme would be ""compiling on windows"", and ""usability"". Or something like that.

Anyway, here is the human-readable changelog:
- Variables and flags can now be renamed in cursor mode [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/dp49kdvy1y1lykbb4n6fsxurb)
- Optimized GDB connectivity, now its 10x faster!
- print signed base 10 hexdumps with pxd[1,2,4]
- radiff2 -C to compare checksums
- Lot of work towards the mach-ification of the OSX/iOS debugger by alvarofe
- more polished cursor movements in Visual mode
- Better ARM and Thumb code analysis and emulation
- Added disassembler support for Microblaze architecture
- Updated unicorn plugin to be in sync with git
- Various enhancements in the Visual mode 
- backward disassembly uses RAnal info for better offset computations
- `asm.bbline` uses RAnal info to have precise results
- fix bug in `env.sh` when using more than 9 arguments
- Mingw compilation improvements
- preliminary support of [XNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU) debugging
- ESIL support for [v810](http://www.archaicpixels.com/images/4/40/U10082EJ1V0UM00.pdf)
- radare2 does now compile in [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/radare/radare2-shvdd): no more excuses for broken commits on windows!
- [Lanai](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095118.html) (the secret CPU used by Google) support
- a new shiny [xtensa](http://ip.cadence.com/ipportfolio/tensilica-ip/xtensa-customizable) CPU analysis backend
- change local variables/arguments format names (`ebp-0x10`, `ebp+0x13` becomes, respectively, `local_10h` and `arg_13h`) and now it works too when asm.ucase is set.
- add `Vdn` option to rename a flag/function/local variable/local argument used in the current instruction
- refactoring of `RFlag` + better names for functions when there are symbols
- `ahi` now supports IPv4 and syscall
- various optimizations and bugfixes
- opcodes descriptions for v810, propeller, riscv, tms320, lm32, i4004, i8080, java, Malbolge, SH-4, M68K, ARC and LH5801 (that you can access with `?d` or e `asm.describe=true`)
- `axg` to get a graph of the function xrefs to reach a specific point.

## Known regressions and future work

The webui graph stopped working on Google Chrome because they have deprecated a js function to manipulate SVG which was used by the joint.js library, the webuis will be distributed in a [separate repository](https://github.com/radare/radare2-webui) and dependencies will be maintained using bower/grunt/npm. This way we will solve the license problems some distros (Debian) complained for not packaging the webuis because of non-free and confusing uglified js blobs. This will hopefully attract more web developers.

Debian, Docker, Void, FreeBSD, Sabotage and other distros raised the interest in our project, so, the 6week release cicle will hopefully fix the problem of having very old packaged versions of r2.

Windows binaries from appveyor still need to be fixed thus the windows installer.

There are some interesting wip patches to be included in the next [release 0.10.2](https://github.com/radare/radare2/milestones) scheduled for April 11th.

Also, it is important to note, that some people started to work on the GSoC microtasks even before knowing if we are accepted this year. This is a good sign which clearly shows the growing, healthy and brave community we have.

## Special thanks to:
- alvaro felipe: for fixing some bugs and enhancing the XNU debugger
- xvilka: finally getting the windows builds happy again
- maijin: for reviewing issues and adding more opcode descriptions
- deffi420: to find and fix some tiny, but important bugs in SDB
- condret: for working on the SIOL branch that will hopefully be merged soon.
- crowell: enhacing the local variables experience
- ret2libc: fixes a bug in dietline, rewrote flags, metadata, better midflags and cursor movement.
- mballano: for commiting for the first time, making RAP:// more consistent.

Have fun with this new release and keep up hacking!

## Greetings

I would like to thank the help from Debian and VoidLinux packagers who pointed
me some issues in the build system and tested against their build machines.
Probably 0.9.7 would never have been released without them (because I was not planning
to make a bugfix release :P)

200953,2012-10-02T02:15:00Z,2014-02-26T11:32:45Z,radare2 0.9.2,"After about 10  months of development I'm proud  to announce a new release of radare2.  It has been delayed  many times and I'm not  happy about that, but stability  requires some time.  I'm happy to see new  contributors and users interested on the project.

This document describes  a compacted list of all the changes done from the previous release (0.9) and this one (0.9.2).

As always, if you want to use the r2 api from python, nodejs or others you need to install the r2-bindings package which depends on valabind and swig.

Big news for  this release  are an official Android  package maintained by Pau Oliva (pof) and an embedded http-1.0 webserver which provides a simple way to implement an user interface.

Lot of bugs has been fixed  and new CPUs are supported while code analysis gets better and is focused on x86-16,32,64, arm and mips.

Enjoy!

## In numbers!
- 1 man
- 8 months
- 18 contributors
- 215 tests
- 603 commits
- 33272 more lines of code

## Looks better!
- r2 now supports UTF-8, RGB and TrueColor ansi codes
- Color palettes and themes
- Use `^x^e` to edit the current prompt line using $EDITOR
- Configuration files follow XDG Freedesktop paths
- Tweaked disasm to make it more readable

See `e??scr.` for more information about the screen options.

## More platforms!
- ARM aarch64
- TI c55x+
- 8051
- Javascript (emscripten)
- ARCcompact

Several enhacements to ARM, ARC, X86, Dalvik, Java (including v7) and Brainfuck assembler/disassemblers. Also, the embedded udis86/GNU based disassemblers have been updated from git.

You can now compile r2 for Haiku and Emscripten!

## Binaries

ASLR is now supported by using the -B flag which specifies the hardcoded base address when loading a PIE binary.
- MACH0 XNU kernels are now properly loaded
- Added support for TE binaries
- Identify some PC BIOS and UEFI ROMs
- Java Class file parser has been rewritten to support Java7
- Reloc information is now fully parsed and import addresses are stored in symbol listing to keep coherence.

Import PLT addresses are no longer listed with rabin2 -i. For consistence: imports are ordinals and PLT entries are listed as symbols.

## Define structs and enums using plain C

A reduced fork of libtcc is now included to parse C include files. At the moment only structs and enums are handled, but it is planned to support function signatures and conditional struct definitions in the future. Nested structures are supported.

``` sh
[0x8048000]> ""td struct Foo { int a; int b; }""
```

See 't?' for more help. But in short, you will be able to load .h files into sdb databases to define metadata for the disassembler.

## Bindings

Following the release of Valabind 0.7.4, we are now able to provide the following changelog:
- Python ctypes support
- Test and install Java JNI bindings
- Untested D language bindings

I have added more scripting examples like a simple debugger.

## UNIX shell right there

Commands like 'clear', 'ls', 'cat', cd', 'pwd' are now supported. No need to escape to the shell with '!' for them. Bear in mind that `cfg.sandbox` can be enabled to restrict access to filesystem, execution or sockets.

Those commands can be piped to system programs using the '|' like in a posix shell. The command line prompt is now better by supporting utf8 and handled new keybindings.

If in visual mode you place the cursor on top of a 'call' instruction that refers to an import and press '?' key you will read the associated manpage. Like 'K' key in vim.

## Debugger

You don't need to specify the path to the debugged program any more. It walks the $PATH or takes ./ if found. This is a way to make windows and unix process launching consistent.

You can run the visual debugger by using the following flags:

``` sh
$ r2 -cVpp -d ls
```

Signals can now be captured, and passed to the target process.

Now you can properly debug 32bit binaries on Linux x86-64.

## SDB Everywhere

SDB is a simple key-value database that supports on-disk hashtable, arrays, json, CAS and easy string serialization for data structures.

From now on we are going to use SDB more and more inside r2 in order to speed up queries, simplify code maintainance and unify data as text with easy serialization methods.

This is the first release that comes with sdb.

## Web UI

An embedded webserver have been included, and you can invoke it using the `=h' or '=H' commands. To make it public just`-e http.public=true`.

``` sh
$ r2 -c=H /bin/ls
```

Improved JSON output for many commands. Just append 'j' to the command and it will use that format. From bindings you can call r_core_cmd_str() to retrieve the resulting string and parse it.

``` js
AJAX.get (""/cmd/isj"", function (data) {
   var symbols = JSON.parse (data);
   ...
}
```

The `r2agent` is a new program that acts as a remote web interface for launching r2 sessions and interact with them using the webui.

## Test everything!

This is the first release of r2 that makes an extensive use of the test suite in order to ensure no regressions appear while developing new features or fixing bugs. This is an important point from now on, so we will be able to cover r2 features, supported instruction set, etc. as much as possible.

We encourage all users to write test cases for every bug they report. Type 'make tests' to retrieve the testsuite from git, but this is only suposed to be used when developing. Stable versions are only for packagers. If you want to report a bug, first test it against the code in git.

The build farm runs the whole testsuite after every commit on the r2 or r2-regressions repos, this allows us to identify when and how every check was broken.

Thanks to a0rtega for his fuzzed binaries.

## Annotated hexdumps

A new command 'pxa' have been added in order to provide support for annotated hexdumps.

Those hexdumps allows visual interaction and permits you to select range of bytes using the cursor mode, colorizing zones, adding comments, defining structs, etc.

This is still under development and we are open to new ideas and proposals to enhace this new interactive print mode.

## More stable

Lot of bugs has been fixed, overflows, memory leaks, and many handcrafted binaries can now be loaded without the butthurt of segfaults, crashes or lack of info.

The farm allows us to get automatic builds for several platforms on every commit. And identify development issues earlier.

## New contributors

I'm pretty impressed by the raise of interest on contributing to radare2 lately, This release would not be possible without the help of the following people:
- a0rtega
- capi_x
- chous
- cosarara
- dx
- earada
- eddyb
- jvoisin
- jjdredd
- Sirmy
- xtraeme
- xvilka
