Many thanks to all the testers of the two beta releases, and I will certainly be continuing to look into the outstanding issues that a couple users have reported. Also, _very many thanks_ to everybody who was patiently waiting for this release ever since the Google Play Music redesign! I would have liked a much shorter release window, but hopefully this version is satisfactory enough to forgive that! Enjoy.

### Added
- Support Google Play Music's latest redesign
- Add support for `⌘[` and `⌘]` keyboard shortcuts to go forward and backward (fixes [#296](https://github.com/radiant-player/radiant-player-mac/issues/296), thanks [@gholts](https://github.com/gholts))
- Implement `⌘A` (select all) shortcut (fixes [#317](https://github.com/radiant-player/radiant-player-mac/issues/317))

### Changes
- Mac OS X 10.8 is no longer supported (see [#291](https://github.com/radiant-player/radiant-player-mac/issues/291) for progress, if any, on the possibility of re-instating support)
- Removed all styles except for Google and Black (formerly Spotify Black) due to incompatibility with the new redesign; I will be looking into porting one or two of the original styles to the new design
- Allow mini player to be used in other full screen applications (fixes [#79](https://github.com/radiant-player/radiant-player-mac/issues/79))
- Open release page instead of home page when a new version is available

### Fixed
- Prevent brief 'ghost' mini player while switching spaces (fixes [#309](https://github.com/radiant-player/radiant-player-mac/issues/309))
- Allow reload button to be clicked when internet connectivity is lost while first loading Google Play Music (fixes [#313](https://github.com/radiant-player/radiant-player-mac/issues/313))

- Minor polish of the dark style
- Tweak stylesheet to support when songs are selected
- Re-enable ⌘A functionality to select all
- Allow reload button to be clicked when internet connectivity is lost

There was also a change that will prevent the startup crashes on Mac OS X 10.8, which have been present since v1.3.3. However, for my machine, Google Play Music does not load in Radiant Player, while it does work properly in Safari. It appears that, at least for me, the version of WebKit used by applications and the version used by Safari differ on the same machine. In order to allow the majority of users to appreciate the working version of Radiant Player, **I will be releasing the next `stable` version while dropping official support for Mac OS X 10.8**. If you are on Mountain Lion and this beta does work properly, please do contact me! I will also try to investigate in the future whether it will be possible to re-extend support to include Mac OS X 10.8.

My apologies everyone for getting this out so late! Between a family emergency and a new internship, it's been difficult to find the time to work on Radiant Player recently but I am still fully intending to support the application!

Google's trademark team contacted me recently and politely asked that I change the name of the application and use a different logo. This is what I came up with (picking a name is surprisingly difficult, as is icon design). This release is a little light on new features as I had to implement this name change as soon as possible.

Update checking should work correctly for now as the repository name is still correct, though given enough time (maybe a week) I will rename the repository to something like `radiant-player-mac`.
