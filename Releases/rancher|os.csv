- Simplify apply network #1796 

## Logging and debugging changes

- Linux 4.4.43 hypriot-v7+ (rancheros-raspberry-pi)

> _Note:_ due to the change from Ubuntu kernels to mainline stable Linux kernels, the `xfce` console is currently not supported, and upgrading systems that use that console will probably break. 

## New Features
- RancherOS now uses an unmodified current mainline Linux kernel - 4.9
- Cloud-init now runs before most system services, allowing it to be used to customize / replace services (#1175)
- Cloud-config file validation `ros config validate` (#1433)
- Image name validation for service, console and engine commands (#1433)
- Completely new installation code - replaces GRUB with Syslinux (including upgrade). (#1456)
- You can now boot from the ISO without a net connection, and the install will run using the installer image on the ISO (#1456)
- The ZFS service uses the source from OpenZFS, and builds it for your kernel. The service now also autostarts. (#1507)
- RancherOS boot and error logging to dmesg to help with debugging (#1415)
- Simplify the way the kernel headers and extras are installed (#1400)
- Rewrite most of the boot scripts in Go and build into `ros` (#1275)
- System console image and service definitions move some RancherOS customizations out of the Dockerfile, and into the service.yml and into the `ros` entrypoint itself. (this will continue in v0.9.0)

## Bug Fixes
- Fix `/etc/os-release` file to be `RancherOS` specific
- A number of robustness fixes to cloud-config and boot params
- Improve Docker Machine compatibility - Virtualbox and VMware

## Important
- Runtime of this release is 180 MB, but to install, you will need 1.5 GB of RAM to install. We are looking into minimizing the amount needed to install.  
- Upgrades using a persistent console are not supported in this version. Please use `--upgrade-console` when upgrading to also upgrade the console.
- The ISO no longer requires a password and SSH will not work with the ISO unless a password is set using `sudo passwd rancher`. 

## New Features
- Added the ability to easily [switch between versions of Docker](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/switching-docker-versions/) and added Docker 1.12 support [#1129]
- Added the ability to [write files to any system service](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/write-files/), e.g. being able to set NTP time servers [#1118]
- Implemented `runcmd` [cloud-config key](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/running-commands/) [#1102]
- Changed the ISO to be stateless by default [#662, #670]
- Removed the default password from the ISO and switched to logging in automatically [#787]

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where boot would occasionally stop due to improperly closed streams [#1090]
- Fixed an issue where automatic resizing wasn't working for non-default consoles [#1099]
- Fixed an issue where array kernel parameters were being parsed incorrectly [#1088]
- Fixed an issue where open-vm-tools was crashing on ESXi [#1096]
- Fixed an issue where an ECS agent would fail due to the Docker socket not being ready [#671]

## Important

There are a couple of known issues regarding upgrading/rolling back:
- Upgrading from v0.4.x will destroy your existing console.
- You will not be able to roll back from v0.5.0 to v0.4.x.

## New Features
- Docker 1.11 Support [#886]
- Ability to [switch between consoles without a reboot](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/custom-console/) [#75]
- [Raspberry Pi 2/3 Support](http://docs.rancher.com/os/running-rancheros/server/raspberry-pi/) [#417]
- open-vm-tools support as a service [#219]
- Ability to [mount additional devices](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/additional-mounts/) [#741]
- [Share mount propogation](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/additional-mounts/#shared-mounts) [#905]
- [Private registry authentication support in cloud config](http://docs.rancher.com/) [#775]
- [Added resize as a cloud config option](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/resizing-device-partition/)
- Ability to [specify version for Amazon ECS Agent service](http://docs.rancher.com/os/amazon-ecs/#version) [#777]
- Updated [documentation](http://docs.rancher.com/os/) for v0.5.0 [#381, #511, #525, #620, #732,#879]

## Major Known Issues
- In Rancher, on hosts added with the custom command, when upgrading from v0.4.5 to v0.5.0, the rancher/agent container may not restart automatically and the host will be displayed as `Reconnecting` in Rancher. To get around this issue, after the host is running v0.5.0, re-launch the rancher/agent command. 

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where switching consoles required networking [#929]
- Fixed an issue where resizefs wouldn't work behind a proxy with the resize option in cloud config [#946]
- Fixed an issue with TLS using Amazon's hostname [#933]
- Fixed an issue so that if an invalid cloud-config was given, no kernel panic would occur [#717]
- Fixed an issue where script execution using GCE's user-data was not working [#507]
- Fixed an issue where default values were not showing up in `ros config export` [#616]

As part of the major refactoring of v0.4.0, **upgrades** from previous versions will not be supported, but we will support upgrades from v0.4.0+. 

## New Features
- Broke apart the build to make it more modular to allow user to customize RancherOS [#258]
  - Added ability to [swap out the kernel for your own kernel](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/custom-kernels/) [#414]
  - Added ability to [customize the user docker version](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/custom-docker/) [#420, #415 ]
  - Ability to [use kernel headers](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/kernel-modules-kernel-headers/) [#579]
  - Ability to [customize storage](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/storage/) [#416, #390, #356]
  - Ability to [create custom RancherOS ISO](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/custom-rancheros-iso/) [#380]
- Made ubuntu and debian into [persistent consoles](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/custom-console/#console-persistence) [#419]
- Removed the `machine-rancheros.iso` from the releases as `rancheros.iso` can be used for `docker-machine. [#513] 
- [Amazon ECS Support](http://docs.rancher.com/os/amazon-ecs/) [#603] - Added ability to have RancherOS AMIs join ECS clusters
- Fixed an issue so that rkt can now be used 
- Added support for glibc, which allows support for rancher-compose and other go based programs [#572]
- Bumped default kernel to v4.2 [#574]
- Removed `rancher.yml` and support `cloud-config.yml` using `ros config` [#454, #573] **Note**: This means that previously `ros config set/get` requires a prefix of `rancher` for all configuration changes.
- Swtiched from `rancheros-install` to `ros install`.
- Raised the limit of open files [#359]
- The required amount of memory has been reduced to **512 MB** [#345] Note: If you want to run `ros install` (formerly `rancheros-install`), you'll still need 1 GB, but this constraint will be removed in v0.4.1.
- [Support for DKMS](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/dkms/) [#264]
- [Support for ZFS](http://docs.rancher.com/os/configuration/storage/#using-zfs) [#599]
