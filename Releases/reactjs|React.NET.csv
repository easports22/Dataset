If you want to use the middleware to transpile JavaScript without pulling in the full ASP.NET MVC Core framework, you can just use the `React.AspNet.Middleware` NuGet package.
 - [#421](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/421) - Upgraded to JSPool 3.0. This has a few small API changes, but should not affect most sites unless you're messing with the internals of ReactJS.NET.
 - [#421](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/421) - The MSBuild task now has an assembly binding for `JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Core`, which should prevent strange errors when the version of `JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8` does not match the version of `JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Core`.
 - [#413](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/413) - The `DefaultEngineName` setting in JavaScriptEngineSwitcher is now respected, and can be used to force a particular engine to be used.

- Support for ASP.NET MVC 3 was removed. MVC 4 was released in 2012, so I hope everyone has upgraded by now :)
- [#294](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/294) - Added support for .NET Core
- [#306](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/306) - Upgraded to JavaScriptEngineSwitcher 2.0
- [#330](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/330) - Use camelcase for JSON by default. This corresponds with a [breaking change made in the final release of ASP.NET Core 1.0](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/194). If you were relying on the legacy behaviour, you can use `SetJsonSerializerSettings` in your ReactJS.NET config to revert back to the old behaviour.

Other tweaks:
- [#323](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/323) - Upgraded to React 15.3.2
- [#331](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/331) - Added option to totally disable server-side rendering. This is useful when debugging your React components, as it's easier to debug client-side
- [#316](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/316) - Added option to use production version of React, and enabled it by default. You can call `SetUseDebugReact(true)` in your ReactJS.NET config to use the debug version. The production version of React is much faster than the debug build, but it has less useful error messages if something does go wrong.

Additionally, syntax error messages are now more detailed and display the correct file name and line number.

JSON.NET does not escape HTML characters in its JSON output by default. As ReactJS.NET uses JSON.NET to output the props of server-side rendered components, a prop that accepts arbitrary user input could potentially contain script tags, allowing for XSS.

Escaping of HTML is now enabled by default. If you are using custom JSON serializer settings, you can enable HTML escaping by setting `StringEscapeHandling` to `StringEscapeHandling.EscapeHtml`:

``` csharp
ReactSiteConfiguration.Configuration.SetJsonSerializerSettings(
  new JsonSerializerSettings
  {
    StringEscapeHandling = StringEscapeHandling.EscapeHtml
  }
);

- [#97](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/97) — Upgrade to JSPool 0.2. This improves the handling of JavaScript engines by recycling them after a number of uses, which ensures memory usage doesn't keep growing over time.
- [#89](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/89) — Fixed ""Object doesn't support property or method 'defineProperty'"" with MSIE engine when [using Flow types](/guides/flow.html).

- [Partial Linux (Mono) support](/guides/mono.html).
  Server-side component rendering is supported, but JSX compilation is not yet
  supported. To use JSX on Mono, you will need to precompile your JSX files
  via MSBuild.
- Cassette MSBuild support - Bundle and minify your JavaScript before
  deployment to improve performance

Internal technical changes:
- React core no longer depends on System.Web, for easier use outside of an
  ASP.NET context (eg. in a command-line or OWIN application)
- JSX transformation split from `IReactEnvironment` into new `IJsxTransformer`
  interface. The previous `IReactEnvironment.LoadJsxFile` and
  `IReactEnvironment.TransformJsx` methods have been marked as obsolete, please
  use `IReactEnvironment.JsxTransformer.TransformJsxFile` instead.

A few other API methods have changed as well. [See the official announcement](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/10/28/react-v0.12.html) for more information on all the changes in this version of React.

ReactJS.NET 1.1.3 also adds preliminary support for using Google's V8 JavaScript engine on Windows, via Microsoft's [ClearScript](https://clearscript.codeplex.com/) project. Previously ReactJS.NET only supported V8 on Mac OS X and Linux. This should be considered beta quality, in that it works but has not been stress tested in a production environment yet (whereas the Linux implementation has been). Future releases will make the handling of JavaScript engines more efficient.

It's not supported for combined/minified files at the moment since none of the common .NET minifiers support source maps. ([#8](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/8))
- React version upgraded from 0.12.0 to 0.12.1.

Server-side rendering:
- The HTML tag used as the component's container can now be changed. Previously it was hardcoded to be a `div`. ([#45](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/45))
- The ID of the container element can now be changed. Previously it was always an auto-generated ID in the format ""react1"", ""react2"", etc. ([#50](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/50))
- New `Html.ReactWithInit` helper method to render both the HTML component and its client-side JavaScript initialisation script. This is useful when rendering self-contained partial views containing React components. _Thanks to BartAdv_. ([#42](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/42))

Under the hood:
- Allow custom `JsonSerializerSettings` to be provided. *Thanks to BartAdv. ([#43](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/43))

Pooling of JavaScript engines is turned on by default but it can be disabled in your site's configuration (usually `ReactConfig.cs`) to revert back to the classic behaviour. This is still experimental, so please let me know if it works well for you!

This release also adds support for stripping out [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) type annotations from your code. Flow is a new open-source static type checker for JavaScript, recently released by Facebook. It adds static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and code quality. You can learn more about Flow in [its release announcement](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1505962329687926/flow-a-new-static-type-checker-for-javascript/).

Other changes:
- [Harmony (ES6)](/guides/es6.html) transformations are enabled by default. They can be disabled in your site's configuration.
- The Cassette integration now transforms all files in the bundle, not just `*.jsx` files. ([#52](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/52))
