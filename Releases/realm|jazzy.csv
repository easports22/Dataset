2959957,2016-04-06T00:46:55Z,2016-04-06T00:56:13Z,0.6.0: Grand Unified Theory,"This release helps bring the behavior of Objective-C category documentation in line with its Swift extension counterpart, merging the category interface into the parent type. Thanks @esad!

Along those same lines, @pcantrell aligned the config file keys to match their command line names. Finally, no more confusion!

So the theme for this release is [unifying previously divergent behaviors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory) so to speak.

Also Jazzy, though formerly a documentation generator, now has the newfound ability to not generate documentation... :trollface:. But seriously, this is useful to validate your documentation by just running jazzy as a dry run, or to check the documentation coverage of your library! Thanks @jverkoey!

There are a number of other changes in this release which you'll find in its entirety below:

##### Breaking
- Config files now use the same option names as the command line. If you are
  using one of the keys that has changed in your `.jazzy.yaml`, you will receive
  a warning. See the [pull request](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/pull/456) for
  a complete list of changed options. As always, you can get a list of all
  options with `jazzy --help config`.  
  [Paul Cantrell](https://github.com/pcantrell)
- Jazzy's undocumented.txt has been replaced with undocumented.json. This new
  format includes contextual information that one might use to lint
  documentation in an automated fashion.  
  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)
- `--swift-version` now defaults to 2.2 instead of 2.1.1.  
  [Tamar Nachmany](https://github.com/tamarnachmany)

##### Enhancements
- Add `--skip-documentation` flag. Skips site generation phase. `undocumented.json`
  is still generated.  
  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)
- Merge Objective-C categories into their parent type documentation to match
  Swift behavior.  
  [Esad Hajdarevic](https://github.com/esad)
  [#457](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/457)
- Add support for documenting Swift 2.2 `associatedtype`s and infix, postfix &
  prefix operators.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

##### Bug Fixes
- Add support for Objective-C module imports.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#452](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/452)
- Workaround for an apparent SourceKit bug which sometimes caused extensions
  to be merged into the wrong type.

  - Autolinks only match ``ThingsInBackticks``, and must match the entire

  - Autolinks supports siblings, ancestors, top-level elements, and
    dot-separated chains starting with any of the above: `someProperty`,
    `SomeType.NestedType.someMethod(_:)`.
  - New `...` wildcard prevents you from having to list all method parameters:
