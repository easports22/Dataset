Important Changes in 0.7.3
==========================

 * For large backups stored in Google Cloud Storage, the `prune` command fails because listing only returns the first 1000 files. This has been corrected, no data is lost in the process. In addition, a plausibility check was added to `prune`.

Important Changes in 0.7.2
==========================

 * We've added an official docker image and a Dockerfile to build this image in
   `docker/`.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1061

 * The git repository layout was changed to resemble the layout typically used
   in Go projects, we're not using `gb` for building restic any more and
   vendoring the dependencies is now taken care of by `dep`.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1126

 * We now support saving backups on Google Cloud Storage.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1134
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1052
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/211

 * We've added support for Microsoft Azure Blob Storage as a restic backend.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1149
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1059
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/609

 * In the course of supporting Microsoft Azure Blobe Storage Go 1.8 is now a
   requirement to build restic.

 * The `restore` command has been improved: When dirs are excluded (or not
   included) in a restore, they are not loaded from the repo any more.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1044

 * Name collisions are now resolved by appending a counter.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1179
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1209


Small changes
-------------

 * The `key` command now prompts for a password even if the original password
   to access a repo has been specified via the `RESTIC_PASSWORD` environment
   variable or a password file.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1132
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1133

 * Properly report errors when reading files with exclude patterns.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1144

 * We now automatically generate man pages for all restic commands, see the
   subdir `doc/man`.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/697
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1147

 * The `key remove` command was corrected and now works as documented.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1164

 * When a restic command other than `init` is used with a local repository and
   the repository directory does not exist, restic creates the directory
   structure. That's an error, only the `init` command should create the dir.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1167
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1182

 * Restic now prints stats on all BSD systems (not only on darwin) when SIGINFO
   is received (usually when ctrl+t is pressed).
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1203
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1082#issuecomment-326279920

 * Since a few releases restic had the ability to write profiling files for
   memory and CPU usage when `debug` is enabled. It was discovered that when
   restic is interrupted (ctrl+c is pressed), the proper shutdown hook is not
   run. This is now corrected.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1191

 * A new option `--exclude-caches` was added that allows excluding cache
   directories (that are tagged as such). This is a special case of a more
   generic option `--exclude-if-present` which excludes a directory if a file
   with a specific name (and contents) is present.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1170
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1224

 * The `forget` command now has an option `--group-by` that allows flexible
   grouping policies.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1196

 * The date and time restic records for a new backup can now be specified
   externally by passing `--time` to the `backup` command.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1205

 * The option `--compact` was added to the `snapshots` command to get a better
   overview of the snapshots in a repo. It limits each snapshot to a single
   line.

======

After releasing restic 0.7.1, we've discovered a serious bug that was more or less accidentally corrected in 0.7.1, the background story is described [in our blog](https://restic.github.io/blog/2017-07-25/please-upgrade-to-0.7.1). **Do not use restic 0.7.0, upgrade to at least 0.7.1**

And now the original release notes text:


----------


We're proud to present restic 0.7.1. The binaries released with each restic version starting are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the [builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).

Important Changes in 0.7.1
==========================

 * The `migrate` command for chaning the `s3legacy` layout to the `default` layout for s3 backends has been improved: It can now be restarted with `restic migrate --force s3_layout` and automatically retries operations on error. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1073 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1075

Small changes
-------------

 * The local and sftp backends now create the subdirs below `data/` on open/init. This way, restic makes sure that they always exist. This is connected to an issue for the sftp server: https://github.com/restic/rest-server/pull/11#issuecomment-309879710 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1055 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1077 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1105

 * When no S3 credentials are specified in the environment variables, restic now tries to load credentials from an IAM instance profile when the s3 backend is used. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1067 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1086

 * On Darwin and FreeBSD, restic now prints stats when SIGINFO is received (usually when ctrl+t is pressed). https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1082

 * The dependencies have been updated. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1108 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1124

 * A bug was found (and corrected) in the index rebuilding after prune, which led to indexes which include blobs that were not present in the repo any more. There were already checks in place which detected this situation and aborted with an error message. A new run of either `prune` or `rebuild-index` corrected the index files. This is now fixed and a test has been added to detect this. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1115

 * Errors for chmod() on Unix for filesystems which do not support it (e.g. smb mounted via gvfs) are now ignored. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1080 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1112

 * The semantic for the `--tags` option to `forget` and `snapshots` was clarified: https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1081 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1090

Important Changes in 0.7.0
==========================

 * New ""swift"" backend: A new backend for the OpenStack Swift cloud storage protocol has been added, https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/975 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/648

 * New ""b2"" backend: A new backend for Backblaze B2 cloud storage service has been added, https://www.backblaze.com https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/512 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/978

 * Improved performance for the `find` command: Restic recognizes paths it has already checked for the files in question, so the number of backend requests is reduced a lot. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/989 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/993

 * Improved performance for the fuse mount: Listing directories which contain large files now is significantly faster. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/998

 * The default layout for the s3 backend is now `default` (instead of `s3legacy`). Also, there's a new `migrate` command to convert an existing repo, it can be run like this: `restic migrate s3_layout` https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/965 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1004

 * The fuse mount now has two more directories: `tags` contains a subdir for each tag, which in turn contains only the snapshots that have this tag. The subdir `hosts` contains a subdir for each host that has a snapshot, and the subdir contains the snapshots for that host. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/636 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1050

Small changes
-------------

 * For the s3 backend we're back to using the high-level API the s3 client library for uploading data, a few users reported dropped connections (which the library will automatically retry now). https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1013 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1023 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1025

 * The `prune` command has been improved and will now remove invalid pack files, for example files that have not been uploaded completely because a backup was interrupted. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1029 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1036

 * The release binaries are now built in a reproducible way, see https://github.com/restic/builder

 * We've fixed a bug where `rebuild-index` would corrupt the index when used with the s3 backend together with the `default` layout. This is not the default setting.

 * Backends based on HTTP now allow several idle connections in parallel. This is especially important for the REST backend, which (when used with a local server) may create a lot connections and exhaust available ports quickly. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/985 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/986

 * Regular status report: We've removed the status report that was printed every 10 seconds when restic is run non-interactively. You can still force reporting the current status by sending a `USR1` signal to the process. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/974

 * The `build.go` now strips the temporary directory used for compilation from the binary. This is the first step in enabling reproducible builds. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/981

This release contains many bug fixes and several improvements for the user interface, the most important changes are listed below (and also contained in the `CHANGELOG.md`.

Important Changes in 0.6.0
==========================

Consistent forget policy
------------------------

The `forget` command was corrected to be more consistent in which snapshots are to be forgotten. It is possible that the new code removes more snapshots than before, so please review what would be deleted by using the `--dry-run` option. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/957 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/953

Unified repository layout
-------------------------

Up to now the s3 backend used a special repository layout. We've decided to unify the repository layout and implemented the default layout also for the s3 backend. For creating a new repository on s3 with the default layout, use `restic -o s3.layout=default init`. For further commands the option is not necessary any more, restic will automatically detect the correct layout to use. A future version will switch to the default layout for new repositories. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/966 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/965

Memory and time improvements for the s3 backend
-----------------------------------------------

We've updated the library used for accessing s3, switched to using a lower level API and added caching for some requests. This lead to a decrease in memory usage and a great speedup. In addition, we added benchmark functions for all backends, so we can track improvements over time. The Continuous Integration test service we're using (Travis) now runs the s3 backend tests not only against a Minio server, but also against the Amazon s3 live service, so we should be notified of any regressions much sooner. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/962 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/960 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/946 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/938 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/883

If no grave bugs occur, it will be released as the final version in a few days. This release contains many bug fixes and several improvements for the user interface, the most important changes are listed below (and also contained in the `CHANGELOG.md`.

Important Changes in 0.6.0
==========================

Consistent forget policy
------------------------

The `forget` command was corrected to be more consistent in which snapshots are to be forgotten. It is possible that the new code removes more snapshots than before, so please review what would be deleted by using the `--dry-run` option. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/957 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/953

Unified repository layout
-------------------------

Up to now the s3 backend used a special repository layout. We've decided to unify the repository layout and implemented the default layout also for the s3 backend. For creating a new repository on s3 with the default layout, use `restic -o s3.layout=default init`. For further commands the option is not necessary any more, restic will automatically detect the correct layout to use. A future version will switch to the default layout for new repositories. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/966 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/965

Memory and time improvements for the s3 backend
-----------------------------------------------

We've updated the library used for accessing s3, switched to using a lower level API and added caching for some requests. This lead to a decrease in memory usage and a great speedup. In addition, we added benchmark functions for all backends, so we can track improvements over time. The Continuous Integration test service we're using (Travis) now runs the s3 backend tests not only against a Minio server, but also against the Amazon s3 live service, so we should be notified of any regressions much sooner. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/962 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/960 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/946 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/938 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/883
