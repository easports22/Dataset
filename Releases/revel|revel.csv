## Breaking Changes
1. Add import path to new `testing` sub-package for all Revel tests. For example:

``` go
package tests

import ""github.com/revel/revel/testing""

type AppTest struct {
    testing.TestSuite
}
```
1. We've relocated modules to a dedicated repo. Make sure you update your `conf/app.conf`. For example, change:

``` ini
module.static=github.com/revel/revel/modules/static
module.testrunner = github.com/revel/revel/modules/testrunner
```

to the new paths:

``` ini
module.static=github.com/revel/modules/static
module.testrunner = github.com/revel/modules/testrunner
```

200619,2014-02-26T04:00:20Z,2014-02-26T04:01:06Z,v0.9.0,"## Revel GitHub Organization

We've moved development of the framework to the @revel GitHub organization, to help manage the project as Revel grows. The old import path is still valid, but will not be updated in the future.

You'll need to manually update your apps to work with the new import path. This can be done by replacing all instances of `github.com/robfig/revel` with `github.com/revel/revel` in your app, and running:

```
$ cd your_app_folder
$ go get -u github.com/howeyc/fsnotify  # needs updating
$ go get github.com/revel/revel
$ go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel     # command line tools have moved
```

**Note:** if you have references to `github.com/robfig/revel/revel` in any files, you need to replace them with `github.com/revel/cmd/revel` _before_ replacing `github.com/robfig/revel`! (note the prefix collision) 

If you have any trouble upgrading or notice something we missed, feel free to hop in the IRC channel (#revel on Freenode) or send the mailing list a message.

Also note, the documentation is now at [revel.github.io](http://revel.github.io)!
