4594722,2016-11-04T22:20:33Z,2016-11-07T21:27:20Z,Ricochet 1.1.4,"Ricochet 1.1.4 fixes some common bugs and usability issues, updates Tor and other important dependencies, contains new and updated translations, and has other minor fixes. All users should update.

You didn't miss 1.1.3 -- it was used to solve a packaging problem, but wasn't ready for a full release. The changelog below includes all changes since version 1.1.2.

I apologize that this isn't the exciting-new-features release we've all been waiting for. Ricochet's development is volunteer-based, and in particular I haven't been able to dedicate as much energy to it as I've wanted to. There's a lot of interest and activity happening right now, and I think there will be some more interesting progress soon.

### Security fixes

By sending a nickname with some HTML tags in a contact request, an attacker could cause Ricochet to make network requests without Tor after the request is accepted, which would reveal the user's IP address. The malicious nickname is clearly displayed, and no network activity takes place unless the request is accepted. We've addressed this vulnerability by sanitizing nicknames in all cases before display, rejecting contact requests with suspicious nicknames, and blocking any network requests at that layer.

Thanks to the incredible Sarah Jamie Lewis (@s-rah) for originally discovering this issue.

### Changes
- Block all network requests to guard against potential deanonymization issues (#303)
- Reject contact requests with nicknames containing suspicious characters
- Sanitize nicknames before use in UI labels
- Fix a common crash when restarting an outbound connection attempt
- Fix a bug which caused connection attempts to contacts to stall until restarted (#295)
- Added translations for Hebrew, Slovenian, and Chinese
- Updated translations
- Updated to Qt 5.5.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1r, and Tor 0.2.7.6
- OS X builds now use AddressSanitizer for hardening

### Important note about old versions

This version is not ""backwards compatible"" with contacts that run Ricochet 1.0.4 or older. **Your contacts must also update** in order to chat again. You will keep your existing address and contacts.

To get everyone updated quickly, people running an older version will see an [automatic message](https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/pull/140) one time from their updated contacts. We intend to keep compatibility in the future, and to not need to resort to this method again.

### Security fixes

This release fixes two issues in Tor, which allow an attacker to crash the tor client and force Ricochet offline. There is no possibility of exploitation or code execution through these bugs.
