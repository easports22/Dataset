We did some touching-up on the new features introduced with the 1.3.0 release. For example it brings back the double-click behavior to open messages which was reduced to the list-only view. Because the switch to change the mail view layout was a bit hidden, we also added it to the preferences section.

The update also includes fixes to reported bugs and one potential XSS vulnerability as well as optimizations to smoothly run on the latest version of PHP. A detailed list of changes is shown below.

With this milestone we introduce new features like:

* Widescreen layout aka Three Column View
* Possibility to display QR code for contacts data
* New [identicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) plugin
* Attach contact vCards to composed message
* Support WEBP images and MathML preview
* Preview, download and rename attachments when composing a message
* Message/rfc822 attachment preview
* Various Enigma (PGP) and Managesieve plugin improvements
* ""Flattened"" the Larry theme giving it a fresher look

Plus security and deployment improvements:

* Improve randomness of password salts and random hashes
* Fixed redundancy in sql caching system and compatibility with Galera Cluster

And finally some code-cleanup:

* Dropped support for legacy browsers (IE < 10; removed `legacy_browser` plugin)
* Require PHP >= 5.4
* Removed PHP `mail()` support
* Removed 3rd party javascript libraries from repo
* Require jQuery 3.x which has breaking changes to older versions

**IMPORTANT**: The code-cleanup part brings major changes and possibly incompatibilities to your existing Roundcube installations. So please read the [Changelog](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Changelog) carefully and thoroughly test your upgrade scenario.

Please note that Roundcube 1.3

1. no longer runs on PHP 5.3
2. no longer supports IE < 10 and old versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari
3. requires an SMTP server connection to send mails
4. uses jQuery 3.2 and will not work with current jQuery mobile plugin

With the release of Roundcube 1.3.0, the previous stable release branches 1.2.x and 1.1.x will switch in to LTS low maintenance mode which means they will only receive important security updates but no longer any regular improvement updates.

- New identicon plugin
- Attach contact vCards to composed message
- Support WEBP images and MathML preview

And finally some code-cleanup:
- Dropped support for legacy browsers (IE < 10; removed `legacy_browser` plugin)
- Require PHP >= 5.4
- Removed PHP `mail()` support
- Removed 3rd party javascript libraries from repo

**IMPORTANT**: The code-cleanup part brings major changes and possibly incompatibilities to your existing Roundcube installations. So please read the [Changelog](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Changelog) carefully and thoroughly test your upgrade scenario.

Please note that Roundcube 1.3
1. no longer runs on PHP 5.3
2. no longer supports IE < 10 and old versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari
3. requires an SMTP server connection to send mails

In case you're running Roundcube directly from source, you now need to install the removed 3rd party javascript modules by executing the following install script:

```
$ bin/install-jsdeps.sh

It introduces new features since version 1.1 primarily focusing on security and PGP encryption:
- PHP7 compatibility
- PGP encryption via Mailvelope (browser) or the Enigma plugin (server-side)
- Drag-n-drop attachments from mail preview to compose window
- Mail messages searching with predefined date interval
- Improved security measures to protect from brute-force attacks

And of course plenty of small improvements and bug fixes.

As already announced with the 1.2-beta release, PGP encryption comes in two flavours: client-side using the Mailvelope browser extension and server-side with the Enigma plugin using GnuPG on the server.

Support with the Mailvelope browser plugin comes out of the box and is enabled if the Mailvelope API is detected in a user's browser. The [Mailvelope documentation](https://www.mailvelope.com/en/help#watchlist) explains how to enable it for your site.

The features of the Enigma plugin, which comes with the release package and simply needs to be activated for your Roundcube installation are explained in [this blog post](https://kolabian.wordpress.com/2015/10/13/enigma-plugin-pgp-encryption/).

**IMPORTANT**: with this version, we finally deprecate some old Roundcube library functions. Please test your plugins thoroughly and look for deprecation warnings in the logs.

With the release of Roundcube 1.2.0, the previous stable release branches 1.0.x and 1.1.x will switch in to LTS low maintenance mode which means they will only receive important security updates but no longer any regular improvement updates.

- PHP7 compatibility
- PGP encryption via Mailvelope (browser) or the Enigma plugin (server-side)
- Drag-n-drop attachments from mail preview to compose window
- Mail messages searching with predefined date interval
- Improved security measures to protect from brute-force attacks

And of course plenty of small improvements and bug fixes.

The PGP encryption support with the Mailvelope browser plugin comes out of the box and is enabled if the Mailvelope API is detected in a user's browser. See the [Mailvelope documentation](https://www.mailvelope.com/en/help#watchlist) how to enable it for your site.

In order to activate server-side PGP encryption for all your users, the `enigma` plugin, which is shipped with this package, has to be enabled in the Roundcube config. See the plugin's README for details.

**IMPORTANT**: with this version, we finally deprecate some [old Roundcube library functions](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/blob/master/program/include/bc.php). Please test your plugins thoroughly and look for deprecation warnings in the logs.

See the complete Changelog on [trac.roundcube.net](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog) and download the new packages from  [roundcube.net](http://roundcube.net/download).

Please note that this is a beta release and we recommend to test it on a separate environment. And don't forget to backup your data before installing it.
