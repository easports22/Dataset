#### Infrastructure:
- support for **watchOS** and **OS X** platforms #1595
- the `SDWebImage xcodeproj` contains the following targets:
  - `SDWebImage iOS static` (iOS static lib)
  - `SDWebImage watchOS static` (watchOS static lib)
  - `SDWebImage OSX` (OSX dynamic framework)
  - `SDWebImage iOS` (iOS dynamic framework)
  - `SDWebImage tvOS` (tvOS dynamic framework)
  - `SDWebImage watchOS` (watchOS dynamic framework)
  - the `SDWebImage Demo xcodeproj` contains the following targets:
    - `SDWebImage OSX Demo`
    - `SDWebImage iOS Demo`
    - `SDWebImage TV Demo`
    - `SDWebImage Watch Demo`
- bumped `libwep` version to `0.5.1`
- improved unit testing code coverage (_35%_ -> **77%**) and integrated [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/gh/rs/SDWebImage)

#### Backwards incompatible changes
- removed all deprecated methods (that we carried around for backwards compatibility in previous versions) #774
- Renamed `SDWebImageManager` `downloadImageWithURL:options:progress:completed:` to `loadImageWithURL:options:progress:completed:` as it makes more sense, since we check the cache first and download only if needed a32a177
- Deleted targets: `SDWebImage+MKAnnotation`, `SDWebImage+WebP`, `SDWebImageFramework`:  
  - `SDWebImage`target that build as a static library (all subspecs included) -> `libSDWebImage.a`
  - `SDWebImageiOS` and `SDWebImagetvOS` targets that build as dynamic frameworks
- Renamed the dynamic frameworks targets from `WebImage` to `SDWebImage`. Renamed the `WebImage.h` to `SDWebImage.h` to match the framework naming
- Renamed the schemes for consistency. Updated the Tests Podfile + project.
- For #883 Fix multiple requests for same image and then canceling one, several breaking changes were needed:
  - `SDWebImageDownloader` method `- downloadImageWithURL:options:progress:completed:` now returns a `SDWebImageDownloadToken *` instead of `id <SDWebImageOperation>` (give the ability to cancel downloads using the returned token)
  - `SDWebImageDownloaderOperation` initializer `- initWithRequest:options:progress:completed:cancelled` split into `- initWithRequest:options` and `addHandlersForProgress:completed:`. Note: there is no more cancel block
- Modern Objective-C syntax done in 64382b9 includes:
  - initializers now return `instancetype` instead of `id`
  - explicit designated initializers (i.e. for `SDImageCache`)
- For #1575 GIF support using FLAnimatedImage, several changes were needed:
  - replaced type `SDWebImageQueryCompletedBlock` with `SDCacheQueryCompletedBlock` and added an `NSData *` param
  - because of the change above, the `done` param of `SDImageCache` `queryDiskCacheForKey:done:` is now a `SDCacheQueryCompletedBlock` and those blocks must now include an `NSData *` param
  - replaced type `SDWebImageCompletionWithFinishedBlock` with `SDInternalCompletionBlock` and added an `NSData *` param
  - because of the change above, the `completed` param of `SDWebImageManager` `loadImageWithURL:options:progress:completed:` is now `SDInternalCompletionBlock` and those blocks must now include an `NSData *` param
  - for consistency with the previous change, also renamed `SDWebImageCompletionBlock` to `SDExternalCompletionBlock`
  - `UIImage` will no longer respond to `sd_animatedGIFNamed:` or `sd_animatedImageByScalingAndCroppingToSize:`
- Xcode 7 Objective-C updates (Lightweight Generics and Nullability) #1581
  - breaks compatibility at least for Swift users of the framework
- **watchOS** and **OS X** support #1595 required
  - renamed `SDWebImage` iOS static lib target to `SDWebImage iOS static` for clarity
- improving the unit tests code coverage #1681 required
  - Refactored `NSData` `ImageContentType` category, instead of returning the contentType as a string, the new added method `sd_imageFormatForImageData` will return a `SDImageFormat` enum value
  - `SDImageCache` configuration properties moved into `SDImageCacheConfiguration` (which is now available via `config` property):
    - `shouldDecompressImages`
    - `shouldDisableiCloud`
    - `shouldCacheImagesInMemory`
    - `maxCacheAge`
    - `maxCacheSize`
  - The `storeImage:` methods from `SDImageCache` were async already, but declared as sync. Properly marked them as async + added completion. Got rid of the recalculate param. If the `NSData` is provided, use it. Otherwise, recalculate from the `UIImage`
  - Removed the synchronous methods `diskImageExistsForURL:` and `cachedImageExistsForURL:` from `SDWebImageManager`
  - Removed the synchronous method `diskImageExistsWithKey:` from `SDImageCache`
  - Get rid of the confusion caused by `cleanDisk` and `clearDisk` on `SDImageCache`. Renamed `cleanDisk` to `deleteOldFiles`. No longer expose the sync `clearDisk` and `deleteOldFiles`, just the async ones.
  - Renamed `SDImageCache` `queryDiskCacheForKey:done:` to `queryCacheOperationForKey:done:`
  - Another `SDImageCache` clarification: `imageFromDiskCacheForKey:` used to also check the memory cache which I think is misleading. Now `imageFromDiskCacheForKey` only checks the disk cache and the new method `imageFromCacheForKey` checks both caches
  - Got rid of `removeImageForKey:` and `removeImageForKey:fromDisk:` from `SDImageCache` that looked sync but were async. Left only the 2 async ones
  - Removed `UIImageView` `sd_cancelCurrentHighlightedImageLoad`
- Added `sd_` prefix to the activity indicator related methods (`setShowActivityIndicatorView:`, `setIndicatorStyle:`, `showActivityIndicatorView`, `addActivityIndicator`, `removeActivityIndicator`) #1640
- Use `dispatch_main_async_safe` for all the completion blocks on the main queue (used to be `dispatch_sync`) - avoiding locks.
- Removed `dispatch_main_sync_safe` as it can be mistakenly used
- Add `url` as param to progress block `SDWebImageDownloaderProgressBlock` - #984

#### Features:
- Switched our GIF support to a better implementation: [FLAnimatedImage by Flipboard](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage) #1575
  - requires iOS 8+ (it's the only way due to FLAnimatedImage requirements)
  - the implementation relies on a `WebCache` category on top of `FLAnimatedImageView`
  - details in the [README](README.md#animated-images-gif-support)
- Converted any remaining code to Modern Objective-C syntax - 64382b9
- Xcode 7 Objective-C updates (Lightweight Generics and Nullability) #1581
- via #1595 Clarified and simplified the usage of `TARGET_OS_*` macros. Added `SD_MAC`, `SD_UIKIT`, `SD_IOS`, `SD_TV`, `SD_WATCH`. The biggest issue here was `TARGET_OS_MAC` was 1 for all platforms and we couldn't rely on it.
- Replaces #1398 Allow to customise cache and image downloader instances used with `SDWebImageManager` - added a new initializer (`initWithCache:downloader:`) 9112170
- `UIImage` responds to `sd_imageData` and `sd_imageDataAsFormat:` via the `MultiFormat` category. Those methods transform a `UIImage` to the `NSData` representation 82d1f2e
- Created `SDWebImageDownloaderOperationInterface` to describe the behavior of a downloader operation. Any custom operation must conform to this protocol df3b6a5
- Refactored all the duplicate code from our `WebCache` categories into a `UIView` `WebCache` category. All the other categories will make calls to this one. Customization of setting the image is done via the `setImageBlock` and the `operationKey` e1840c3
- Due to the change above, the activity indicator can now be added to `UIButton`, `MKAnnotationView`, `UIImageView`
- Animated WebP support #1438
- The shared objects (not really singletons) should allow subclassing, therefore the return type of the shared resource method should be `instancetype` and not a fixed type - c57cf7e
- Allow to specify `NSURLSessionConfiguration` for `SDWebImageDownloader` #1654
- Add `url` as param to progress block `SDWebImageDownloaderProgressBlock` - #984

#### Fixes:
- Fix multiple requests for same image and then canceling one #883 + 8a78586
- Fixed #1444 and the master build thanks to [@kenmaz](https://github.com/kenmaz/SDWebImage/commit/5034c334be50765dfe4e97c48bcb74ef64175188)
- Fixed an issue with the `SDWebImageDownloaderOperation` : `cancelInternal` was not called because of the old mechanism rellying on the `thread` property - probably because that thread did not have a runloop. Removed that and now cancelInternal is called as expected f4bdae6
- Replaced #781 on replacing dispatch_sync with dispatch_async for the main queue 062e50a f7e8246 c77adf4 fdb8b2c 265ace4 0c47bc3. Check for main queue instead of main thread.
- Fixed #1619 iOS 10 crash (`setObjectForKey: object cannot be nil`) - #1676 7940577
- Fixed #1326 #1424 (`Carthage bitcode issue`) - #1593
- Fixed #1639 via #1657 (`Add support for downloading images behind redirect`)
- Replaced #1537 via 9cd6779 - fixed a potential retain cycle
- Updated `dispatch_main_async_safe` macro in order to avoid redefinition when included as Pod
- Fixed #1089 by updating the docs on the calling queue for the `progressBlock` (background queue)
- Fixed a compilation issue on `FLAnimatedImageView+WebCache` - #1687

## Bugfixes
- Fixed Xcode 6 builds - #741 0b47342

  For consistency, added async methods in `SDWebImageManager` `cachedImageExistsForURL:completion:` and `diskImageExistsForURL:completion:`
