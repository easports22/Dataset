We recently discovered that Rubinius installs the gem version with pre-compiled extensions. The internal guard logic assumed that the C-native build would only be installed under MRI. As a result we were experiencing unintended behavior on Rubinius. This PR addresses this issue by adding more robust guard clauses, attempting to ensure that C extensions are only loaded on MRI, regardless of what platform a particular interpreter reports.

Because the release of 0.7.0 was put on hold, the guard clauses are very brute-force. They can probably be cleaned up in a later release.

NOTE: It has been suggested that we consider using a gem called Redcarpet for the guard functionality. This gem was unknown to us until yesterday. At this time we have explicitly decided to not include an external gem dependencies. We will consider using Redcarpet in a future release.

- The old thread pools have been completely rewritten, based heavily on Java's executors. Several new executors have been added, and many executors include JRuby optimizations.

The most important changes are to thread pools. Thread pools have been completely rewritten. The behavior of `FixedThreadPool` and `CachedThreadPool` have not changed, but they now both extend a common base class called `ThreadPoolExecutor`. On JRuby this base class is a thin wrapper around `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor`. Subsequently the global thread pool has been updated from an instance of `PerThreadExecutor` (formerly `NullThreadPool`) to an instance of `CachedThreadPool`. This should increase the performance of all tasks using the global thread pool (such as `Future`, `Agent`, `Promise`, and others), especially on JRuby.
