3937057,2016-08-22T03:00:59Z,2016-08-22T03:01:36Z,v2.0.0,"This version contains several potential **_breaking changes**_:
- `setup()` has been reverted to pre v1.8.0 behaviour; meaning it will return the _instance_ rather than the _element_. This is because the reference to the instance is no longer added to the original element (see below).
- The reference to the `plyr` instance is now added to the media element rather than original container. This is because if a container with multiple children was passed to `setup()` the references to all instances would have been added to the container, creating issues. I would recommend using the return value from `setup()` or the new `get()` method to access the instance.
- Players will always be wrapped in their own div now - this makes `setup()` and `destroy()` cleaner. This _may_ break any custom styling based on DOM position. 
- Players no longer seek to 0 on 'ended' - this is to fix a bug with Microsoft Edge as it triggers 'ended' on media change for whatever reason. They'll never change ;-) 

And some other changes and bug fixes:
- New `get()` method on the global plyr object to get all instances inside a container
- New API methods:
  - `getOriginal()` to get the original, _unmodified_ element plyr was setup on (`<video>`, `<audio>` or empty `<div>` for YouTube and Vimeo)
  - `getContainer()` to get the players outer wrapper element
  - `getMedia()` to get the players media element (`<video>`, `<audio>` or empty `<div>` for YouTube and Vimeo)
  - `getEmbed()` to access the YouTube or Vimeo API directly
  - `getType()` to get the type of the player
  - `isReady()` to determine if an instance has completed setup and necessary APIs are loaded (for YouTube / Vimeo)
  - `on()` to provide an easy way to listen to events
  - `stop()` to, you guessed it, stop the player
- `destroy()` now works correctly for YouTube and Vimeo (fixes #272)
- New `destroyed` event when `destroy()` has completed (original element is passed as event.target)
- Default volume is now 10 (max) rather than 5
- Sprite is only loaded once (fixes #259)
- Fixes for Vimeo post message bugs on source change or destroy (fixes #318)
- Save caption state in storage (fixes #311)
- Added keyboard shortcuts to the current focused player (with `keyboardShortcuts` boolean option to disable) (fixes #309)

- Toggle mute bug fix; if a player was muted previously and the user refreshed, unmuting would have meant volume was still zero (effectively muted), now the config default value is used. Not ideal but good for now
- New `iconUrl` option allowing specifying a same origin SVG sprite location. Loading this way means you don't need the AJAX sprite loading JavaScript
- `click` option renamed to `clickToPlay` to make it a bit more self explanatory. Unfortunately cross origin SVG sprites is not supported in any browser yet :-(
- `hideControls` is now a global option, rather than being exclusive to fullscreen. Controls are now hidden after 2 seconds of no mouse movement. Controls are always shown when media is paused or stopped. This is defaulted to true.
- `sass` folder in `src` renamed from to `scss`
