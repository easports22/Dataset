The Linux binaries we supply are not compatible with the way Node is compiled on Alpine Linux. This means that although the installation will succeed, it takes much longer because the native code needs to be compiled locally.

Thanks to the hard work of @lox and @S-YOU we're now able to supply Alpine Linux compatible binaries.

In v3.9.0 started publishing our test suite to npm. This caused issues for users on systems with poor unicode support or file path length limits. This changed was reverted until we could engineer a better solution.

In this release we've migrated our test suite to a separate npm module which is now a devDependency. With change users will only download the test suite on an opt-in basis by explicitly install devDependencies.

In v3.9.0 we began publishing our test suite to npm as part of our release. We did this be compliant with the node-citgm project. Being the citgm would give us early warning of changes in Node that would break Node Sass for users. We'd hoped this would allows to address these issue early and avoid the dozens of bug reports we receive.

However some users have experience issues with some test filenames include unicode characters. Some npm@2 users have also experienced issues with our path names being too long.

As a result we're temporarily reverting the addition of our test suite until we have a solution for these issues.

## We're sorry 💖

Noone ever wants to break someone's build. We had expected this minor change to be innocuous. 

Unfortunately we had not accounted for the variety of operating environments our +2M monthly downloads would be running on.  Although the number of affected users was small, the failure was at times catastrophic.

Having this feature is important to us, but not breaking your builds, and workflows is critical.

Installation issues are a steady background noise of Node Sass. These issues are mostly to local environment issues that are simply out of control. These issue take up a lot of time so we've been trying to provide more useful output when an installation fails.

This release we focused on adding more visibility to the binary download process. NPM will now output when it begins to download the binary, where it's downloading the binary from, as well as progress bar. It's how hope that this additional transparency will allow users to self-diagnose local problems before opening an issue. 

The download progress bar respects npm's `progress` config flag.

We've also added a generous download timeout to prevent rare instances of installs hanging infinitely.

@andyxxsd @xzyfer, #1695 #1694 #1691 

## CI stability

Our CI has been growing increasingly flakey. After a lot of investigation the main culprit appears to `child_process.spawnSync` on Node 0.10.x. We've put some work arounds in place to increase the stability of our CI whilst maintaining test coverage.

@nschonni @xzyfer, #1692 #1697 

## SASS_PATH support

You can now set the `SASS_PATH` environment variable to a colon delimited list of directories and Sass will automatically look in each of them when finding a file for `@import`. This is a little known feature of Ruby Sass which has been added to aid compatibility.

You've asked, and asked, and asked... and here it is. It took a little longer than we'd hoped due a [bug we discovered](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/6500) in Node.js 6 which broken our Windows builds.

Previous versions of Node Sass worked fine with Node.js 6 but produced scary looking warnings the console.

Currently to detect user local settings, when downloading the precompiled binaries, we use a deprecated package. We've replaced this packaged with the offical npm environment variables. This drastically simplifies our install script.

A previously undocumented `process.sass` has been deprecated (#1427). It will be removed in a future release. Access this API will produce a deprecation warning in the console.

### LibSass 3.3.5

This release includes the recent massive Delorean release as well as couple follow up bug fix release. We delayed this release until LibSass had fixed some issue that cropped in Delorean.

Check the changelogs for more information
- [3.3.3: Delorean](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.3.3)
- [3.3.4: Christine](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.3.4)
- [3.3.5: General Lee](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.3.5)

### Improved installation errors

> ""The `libsass` binding was not found.”

Say goodbye to this infamous error. The root cause is unavoidable but we can do a better job and helping you fix it without filing an issue. Thanks to @xzyfer you'll now encounter something a bit more friendly!

### Custom functions

Thanks to @eoneill custom functions now have access to current render context via `this`.

The benefit of this is that custom functions can persist data (be stateful), for the lifespan of the `render`. For example this is now possible:

``` js
{
  ...,
  functions: {
    ""register-foo($foo)"": function($foo) {
      this.myNamespace.$foo = $foo;
      ...
    },
    ""get-foo()"": function() {
      return this.myNamespace.$foo;
    }
  }
}
```

### Features
- CLI example added to README (@incompl, #1368)
- CLI documentation updated (@qm3ster, #1363)
- CLI `--help` text has updated and improved (@glassdimly, #1177)
- Improved support for `npm pack` (@gkatsev, #1183)
- Custom importer documentation updated (@xzyfer, #1424)

### Fixes
- Custom importers weren't always being fired (@xzyfer, #1416)
  - Thanks to @nowells and @beatak for writing tests (#1381, #1420)
- NetBSD failing due to node-gyp (@xzyfer, #1386)
  - Thanks to @saper for tracking down the root cause

### Misc
- Updated some dependencies (@delitescere, #1413)
- Replaced deprecated `npmconf` dependency (@delitescere, #1413)
- Added `bugs` url to package.json (@keithamus, #1367)

### Thanks!

As always the Node Sass would love to give a huge ""thank you!"" to all the contributors that made this release possible! We couldn't do it without you. ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

npm install node-sass@3.0.0-alpha.0     # (updated)

### Breaking Changes:
- Dropped method-style callback in favour of node-style option: (suggested by @sindresorhus; #676)
  Implemented by: @Jakobo
  
  ##### Old:
  
  ``` javascript
    require('node-sass').render({
      /* options */,
     success: function (result) { },
     error: function (err) { }
    });
  ```
  
  ##### New:
  
  ``` javascript
    require('node-sass').render({
      /* options */
    }, function (err, result) { });
  ```
- API returns `Buffer` output as opposed to `String`. (suggested by @joliss #711)
  
  ##### Old:
  
  ``` javascript
    require('node-sass').render({
      /* options */,
      success: function(result) {
        assert(typeof result.css === 'string');
        assert(typeof result.map === 'string');
      }
    });
  ```
  
  ##### New:
  
  ``` javascript
    require('node-sass').render({
      /* options */
    }, function (err, result) {
      if (err) {
        return myErrorHandler(err);
      }
  
      assert(result.css instanceof Buffer);
      assert(result.map instanceof Buffer);
    });
  ```
- Retired image path options. (driven by the change in libsass #702)
- CLI now throws output to `stdout`, when no output file/directory is specified. (suggested by @xzyfer #669)
- The input, output and map paths are resolved against current-working-directory before passing to libsass. This fixes the issues with invalid paths in source-maps. (issue reported by @itsnydell: #731)

### Enhancements
- Now `this.options` is available in `importer` and `render` callbacks. Implemented by @Jakobo via #686 . Also, see the related issue: #674.
- Made API throw Error object instead of Strings: (suggested by @sindresorhus; #675)
  
  ##### Old:
  
  ``` javascript
    require('node-sass').render({
      /* options */,
      error: function(err) {
        assert(typeof err === 'string');
    });

- Ignore test directory from package. (suggested by @dcbarans: #683)

### Infrastructure:
- Better support for io.js rapid release cycle. (suggested by @xzyfer #694).
- Binaries downloadable from custom URL.(suggested by @johnrc #720).
- Binaries are now uploaded as release assets, which used to be hosted via `node-sass-binaries` repo release.(suggested by @nschonni  #712).

> npm install node-sass@2.0.0-beta

# New Features:
- **Custom Importer:** is a user-defined function, which libsass calls whenever SASS `@import` directive (as opposed to CSS3 one) is encountered. It can return result synchronously or asynchronously. Details are present in README. Also, see #44.
- **Custom Importer:** available via CLI usage as well. See README under [CLI Usage](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#usage-1) section.
- **sourceMapEmbed** option when set to true, it embeds source-maps in CSS `sourceMappingURL` comment.
- **sourceMapContents** option when set to true, it the actual SCSS content in source-map `contents[]` array.
- Both node-sass and libsass version info is now displayed via code usage: `require('node-sass').info()` and also displayed via CLI usage with `--help` option.
- In `render`, `error` callback now emits object with `column` info. 

# Breaking Changes:

The node-sass API is overhauled, which presents some breaking changes:
- `renderFileSync` is removed. Use `renderSync` which accept `file`, `data` or both. See [examples](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#examples) in README for details.
- `success` and `error` callbacks now return object. Again it is exampled in README.
- `renderSync` also returns an object (or in case of error, a JS object literal is printed on standout).
- `stats` option is retired. `stats` object will always be returned as part of result.
- `stats` in result does not emit source-map, since we are emitting `map` as part of result anyway..
- node-sass does not write output to disk from code usage. It will deliver the output which user can store in file/data-base or generate in-memory HTTP responses.

# Known issues:
- You may find some abnormal behavior, when throttling simultaneous requests when using importers. In which case, please open an issue with detailed, tangible reproduction steps (as I could not isolate the code from our bug suite which is the source of this misbehaviour).
- In case of incompatible binary (issue #517, //cc @nsams, @laurelnaiad et al.), the installation step would not indicate the problem, but the usage will throw. We revoke this condition, as tests are not passing on Linux. On Windows they pass intermittently due to the aforementioned (throttling) issue. _Note that issue #517 is still unresolved._

# Gratitude:

Thanks for everyone who provided valuable feedback and contributed in development. Special thanks to:

@mgreter, @xzyfer, @andrew for handful of suggestions and feedback.
