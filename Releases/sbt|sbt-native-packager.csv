8226216,2017-10-23T17:26:50Z,2017-10-23T19:03:44Z,1.3.0 Release,"This is an outstanding release by the community and contains a lot of
great improvements. Thanks a lot to all the big and small contributions
for this release.

## Docker

This release contains various changes to the docker support.

### Upgrades and maintenance

@NeQuissimus updated all docker dependencies in #1034
and replaced the deprecated `MAINTAINER` with `LABEL`.

### dockerVersion setting

@mrfyda added a new setting `dockerVersion`, which contains the detected
docker version if possible. This allows adopting newer docker features,
while keeping backwards compatibility.

### chown flag support

@mrfyda added in #1044 the newly introduced `chown` flag for the docker `ADD` command.
This should remove the duplicated layer, which simply `chown`s all files in the image.

## Windows

@dwickern improved the windows bat scripts in #1040 and #1042.
They now support the `application.ini` as the bash scripts and adding
additional java commands via `batScriptExtraDefines`.

## RPM

@erickpintor picked up and finished the work from @dpennell and
simplified symlinks in RPM packages in #1039.

## Umask

@keirlawson added a useful recipe for setting the `umask` for packages
that are build with the `JavaServerAppPackaging` in #1038.

3832262,2016-08-07T21:16:37Z,2016-08-07T21:24:47Z,RPM fixes and Docker enhancements,"## Breaking Changes

This release includes two changes, which will break current behavior.

### dockerTarget renamed

In previous version of native-packager an undocumented setting `dockerTarget` was exposed.
This was renamed `dockerAlias` and the typed changed from `String` to `DockerAlias`. The
default value is

``` scala
dockerAlias := DockerAlias(
  registryHost = dockerRepository.value,
  username = None,
  name = packageName.value,
  tag = Some(version.value)
)
```

See #854 for all details

### Rescope rpm settings

All settings prefixed with `rpm` were moved out of the `Rpm` scope. This means that you should
remove the `in Rpm` configuration scope for settings and tasks prefixed with `rpm`. For example:

``` scala
// before
rpmBrpJavaRepackJars in Rpm := false

// after
rpmBrpJavaRepackJars := false
```

See #826

3279315,2016-05-22T17:43:22Z,2016-05-22T17:47:29Z,Systemloader AutoPlugins,"## Breaking Changes

This release transfer the `systemloader` feature from the `JavaAppServerPackaging` archetype to a new set of archetype plugins called _systemloader plugins_.

### Migration

Assuming you have build like this

``` scala
enablePlugins(JavaServerAppPackaging)
```

you must now add a systemloader explicitly via an AutoPlugin.

``` scala
enablePlugins(JavaServerAppPackaging, SystemdPlugin)
```

You also need to remove code like this as it will not work anymore

``` scala
// import is wrong
import com.typesafe.sbt.packager.archetypes.ServerLoader
// will have strange effects
serverLoading in Rpm := ServerLoader.Upstart
serverLoading in Debian := ServerLoader.SystemV
```

### Motivation

Why did we change this behaviour?
1. Default choices for systemloaders are to fragile as these vary from distribution and version
2. Customization was not really possible. Now we can provide systemloader specific task/settings to customize the systemloader configurations
3. Reusability. You are now free to use systemloaders with everyother archetype without the setup the `JavaServerAppPackaging` adds. For example `enablePlugins(JavaAppPackaging, SystemdPlugin)` is enough if you don't need log and pid folders or the _etc-default_ support.
4. Cleaner code. This is affects you directly as we can change systemloader behaviour faster and fix bugs in the plugin responsible for the specific systemloader. Next steps will be to add customization for `systemd` ( see #785 for a list of related issues ).

This changes however come at a price. You now only can use _one_ systemloader per sbt-module. If you need different systemloaders for rpm/debian, you will have to create two submodules with different configurations.

See #785 for the initial discussion.

## Maintainer Scripts

The `rpm` and `debian` maintainer scripts have grown over the past years in sbt-native-packager. There settings for rpm scriplets (e.g. `rpmPre`) with hard to use types (`Option[String]`) or no helper methods for the `debianMaintainerScripts`.

With this milestone we introduce a [new task-setting](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/latest/api/#com.typesafe.sbt.packager.NativePackagerKeys):

``` scala
maintainerScripts: Map[String, Seq[String]]
```

This will serve as the low level data-structure for all package formats that use maintainer scripts. We have plenty of docs to support you:
- [RPM migration](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/rpm.html#scriptlet-migration-from-1-0-x)
- [Debian docs](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/debian.html#customize)
- [Scaladoc for helper methods](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/latest/api/#com.typesafe.sbt.packager.archetypes.MaintainerScriptHelper)

To give you a peak what it looked before and after

**Before**

``` scala
rpmPostun := rpmPost.value.map { content =>
  s""""""|$content
     |echo 'hello, world
     |"""""".stripMargin
  }.orElse {
   Option(""""""echo 'hello, world""
   """""".stripMargin)
  }
```

**After**

``` scala
import RpmConstants._
maintainerScripts in Rpm := maintainerScriptsAppend((maintainerScripts in Rpm).value)(
   Postun -> ""echo 'hello, world'""
)
```

## JDeb & Spotify-Docker marked as ""provided""

We marked both dependencies as `provided` to avoid unnecessary dependencies you either need nor want.
Both introduced issues with logging on the sbt-level as well. 

### Migration

If you used either the `JDebPackaging` or `DockerSpotifyClientPlugin` autoplugins you need to add the dependencies your self. In your `plugins.sbt` add the following

``` scala
// if you use JDeb
libraryDependencies += ""org.vafer"" % ""jdeb"" % ""1.3"" artifacts (Artifact(""jdeb"", ""jar"", ""jar""))

// if you use Spotify Docker
libraryDependencies += ""com.spotify"" % ""docker-client"" % ""3.2.1""
```

## Proguard documentation

@mikebridge added documentation on how to use `sbt-proguard` along with `sbt-assembly`
and `sbt-native-packager`

http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/topics/custom.html#proguard

We marked both dependencies as `provided` to avoid unnecessary dependencies you either need nor want.
Both introduced issues with logging on the sbt-level as well. 

### Migration

If you used either the `JDebPackaging` or `DockerSpotifyClientPlugin` autoplugins you need to add the dependencies your self. In your `plugins.sbt` add the following

``` scala
// if you use JDeb
libraryDependencies += ""org.vafer"" % ""jdeb"" % ""1.3"" artifacts (Artifact(""jdeb"", ""jar"", ""jar""))

// if you use Spotify Docker
libraryDependencies += ""com.spotify"" % ""docker-client"" % ""3.2.1""
```

## Proguard documentation

@mikebridge added documentation on how to use `sbt-proguard` along with `sbt-assembly`
and `sbt-native-packager`

The `rpm` and `debian` maintainer scripts have grown over the past years in sbt-native-packager. There settings for rpm scriplets (e.g. `rpmPre`) with hard to use types (`Option[String]`) or no helper methods for the `debianMaintainerScripts`.

With this milestone we introduce a [new task-setting](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/latest/api/#com.typesafe.sbt.packager.NativePackagerKeys):

``` scala
maintainerScripts: Map[String, Seq[String]]
```

This will serve as the low level data-structure for all package formats that use maintainer scripts. We have plenty of docs to support you:
- [RPM migration](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/rpm.html#scriptlet-migration-from-1-0-x)
- [Debian docs](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/debian.html#customize)
- [Scaladoc for helper methods](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/latest/api/#com.typesafe.sbt.packager.archetypes.MaintainerScriptHelper)

To give you a peak what it looked before and after

**Before**

``` scala
rpmPostun := rpmPost.value.map { content =>
  s""""""|$content
     |echo 'hello, world
     |"""""".stripMargin
  }.orElse {
   Option(""""""echo 'hello, world""
   """""".stripMargin)
  }
```

**After**

``` scala
import RpmConstants._
maintainerScripts in Rpm := maintainerScriptsAppend((maintainerScripts in Rpm).value)(
   Postun -> ""echo 'hello, world'""
)
```

1153598,2015-04-11T12:28:09Z,2015-04-11T15:44:01Z,AutoPlugins,"## Features

This release comes with a bunch of new features.
- configuration with sbt `AutoPlugins`
- improved docker API
- `javapackager` integration
- more robust and stable bat scripts
- more predefined configuration plugins, e.g. `ClasspathJarPlugin` and `LauncherJarPlugin`
- improved docs

## Breaking changes
- Java 7 or higher required
- `JavaAppPackaging` configuration works with `application.ini`
- `JavaServerAppPackaging` configuration via `etc-default` works the way it should: by sourcing the `etc-default`. See [1.0.0-RC1 Release Notes](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager/releases/tag/v1.0.0-RC2)

## Special thanks

This release wouldn't have been possible without the astonishing help of all our contributors.
We would especially like to thank
- @nazoking / @bjuric / @tartakynov  for all the windows support
- @dwhjames for all the last-minute rpm fixes
- @metasim for his `javapackager` integration
- and everybody else for fixing the small things in order to provide a better UX

you are amazing!

We changed the shape of `etc-default` as it is meant to be. 
There are two different configuration files now.

| setting | location | description |
| --- | --- | --- |

Noteable changes are
- Refactoring of the docker API. You can now access the raw docker commands via the `dockerCommands` task
- Adding experimental support for the JDK8 `javapackager` tool.
- Upgrading to Java 7, which allows us to remove system calls like `chmod` and replace it with a platform independent java solution

This release is a first preview on how sbt-native-packager will handle your build
configuration in the future. The main point is

> Everything is an autoplugin

Enabling java packaging looks like this

``` scala
enablePlugins(JavaAppPackaging)
```

sbt will enable all required plugins to make the app packaging work.
You can also enable only a specific packaging plugin like

``` scala
enablePlugins(DockerPlugin)
```

or disable an unwanted plugin

``` scala
disablePlugins(WindowsPlugin)
```

Available Plugins are
- `JavaAppPackaginPlugin`
- `AkkaAppPackaginPlugin`
- `JavaServerAppPackaging`
- `UniversalPlugin`
- `DockerPlugin`
- `DebianPlugin`
  -- `JDebPackaging`
- `RpmPlugin`
- `WindowsPlugin`
- `SbtNativePackager` (this one defines only generic settings used by all packaging plugins)

526260,2014-08-31T09:40:06Z,2014-08-31T10:34:38Z,SBT and Scala Upgrade,"This release is binary incompatible with the `0.7.x` stream. You will have
to use sbt `0.13.x` and scala `2.10.x` at least.

This release also changes the naming behavior of packages. The
`normalizedName` setting is replaced by a custom `packageName`
setting. See #250 for more details.
