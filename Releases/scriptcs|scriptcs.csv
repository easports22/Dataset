Special thanks to: @BlackFrog1, @gregoryyoung, @aarondandy, and @rickardp for their contributions to this release.

### This Release

This is the first release in a while for scriptcs. It includes some great new features such as Pretty Printing, Support for NuGet credentials, enrichment to the execution environment and more!

For API users (hosting or other programmatic usage), there is one major change, the removal of members exposing Common.Logging types (#1189) from the public API. These were deprecated in version 0.15.0. As a result, the ScriptCs.Core NuGet package no longer takes a dependency on the Common.Logging package.

### Breaking API Changes

**High impact**: Common.Logging types have been removed from the scriptcs public API.

**Medium impact**: The ScriptCs.Core NuGet package no longer takes a dependency on the Common.Logging package. If you are using Common.Logging for other purposes, after upgrading your project to ScriptCs.Core 0.17.0 you should check to see if NuGet has removed Common.Logging. If so, you will have to reinstall it yourself.

**Low impact**: 

*Affects hosters / module authors only*
* The `IConsole` interface has a new `Width` parameter. 
* The  `IScriptEnvironment` interface has new members `AddCustomPrinter<T>)`, `Print<T>()`, `ScriptPath`, `LoadedScripts`, `ScriptAssembly`, and `Initialize()`. 
* The `FileParserContext` and `FilePreProcessResult` classes have a new member: `ScriptPath`

### Issue Details

#### New Features

* Common Logging is gone! (#1190) - by @glennblock. Kudos to @adamralph for getting everything in place to allow the surgical removal.
* Pretty printing support has now been added to the REPL (#1156) - by @gregoryyoung

* You can now access the main script and any loaded script paths using the new `Env.ScriptPath` and `Env.LoadedScripts` properties (#225) - by @glennblock
* You can access the compiled script assembly from within a script using the new `Env.ScriptAssembly` property. This alleviates having to use reflection or jump through hoops to get the script assembly (#244) - by @glennblock

This release brings a _MAJOR_ upgrade to scriptcs.

## New Roslyn!

The most prominent feature is we've upgraded to newer Roslyn `1.0.0-rc2` bits!  This is a big deal as we've been on the same bits for 3+ years and this brings some major enhancements. The new Roslyn _finally_ brings async/await and dynamic to scripts running on .NET. Not only that, it includes awesome new language enhancements of [C# 6.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn802602.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396), like Auto-Property initializers!

**Note** - We are updating to Roslyn `1.0.0-rc2` and not the latest Roslyn `1.2.1` as the newer bits require .NET 4.6+ and this allows us to keep .NET 4.5 compat.

Look below and see dynamic and Auto-Property initializers in action (On Windows)!

And here is an example using async/await!

## REPL enhancements from Mono

This release includes enhancements in our REPL to make it behave similar to the Bash shell. This includes Emacs  keybindings, history, searching, etc. Special thanks to @migueldeicaza for this contribution.

Below you can see I have pressed `ctrl+R` to use reverse-search to find the code that I had entered with `a`. As it is reverse it found the last line that I had entered.

## Debugging in Visual Studio

A long sought after feature for scriptcs has been to enable debugging in Visual Studio. In this release we introduce the `:openvs` command. From the repl, you can type `:openvs ""[filename]""` and it will create a solution for you including all the files and subdirectories in the same folder. It will then launch Visual Studio where you can execute the script and debug! You can add breakpoints, watches, etc. 

Below you can see a screenshot:

## Breaking API Changes

**Low Impact** - The `IConsole.ReadLine` method signature has changed to `string ReadLine(string prompt)`. This was necessary to properly support the latest REPL enhancements. This change will impact custom hosters who have provided their own `IConsole` implementation and it will need to get updated to support the new signature.

## Issue Details

This release, our first for a while, introduces a new `:scriptpacks` REPL command, fixes a bug which prevented `else` from being used in Mono and many other small enhancements, bug fixes and performance improvements as well as a significant API change. See 'Issue Details' below for more details.

For API users (hosting or other programmatic usage), there is one major change, the deprecation of Common.Logging (#847). This has been replaced by [LibLog](https://github.com/damianh/LibLog), but this is an internal implementation detail, since LibLog is a source code package. The end effect for scriptcs API users is that the members which use Common.Logging types have been obsoleted in the public API and replaced with new members which use types under the `ScriptCs.Contracts` namespace. Support for the Common.Logging types will be removed completely in a later release and the dependency on Common.Logging will be removed entirely, so you are encouraged to switch to the new API as soon as possible.

**All script packs, script libraries, modules, hosts and other code which uses the scriptcs NuGet packages should be changed to switch from using the Common.Logging members to the new API members as soon as possible to prevent breakage when Common.Logging is removed.** For more details, see the [related blog post](http://blog.scriptcs.net/2015/08/03/deprecating-common-logging/).

For users of ScriptCs.Hosting there is also a further minor change to make the API a little more friendly (#998).

### Breaking API Changes

**Low impact**: The `ScriptCs.Hosting.IScriptServicesBuilder` interface has a new method, `LoadScriptPacks(bool load = true)`. Given there is little utility for API users in implementing this interface, it is _extremely_ unlikely that this will cause any breakages. Indeed, this interface may even be removed in future.

This release is **JAM PACKED** with new features which are listed below:

### Mono Support!!!!

Since we first started this project, we had a dream of one day working on [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page). Today that dream has come true! We've just shipped initial support for Mono. Resting on the Mono CSharp compiler, you can now run your scripts on [Mac and Linux](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Installing-on-Mac-and-Linux) with Mono. 

You can run scriptcs, use script packs / nuget and work with the REPL. We don't have full parity yet syntax wise, but this is something we will be continuing to flesh out. Module support has not yet been verified, but we believe it works :-) 

_Special thanks to [Stone Gíslason](https://github.com/ztone) for his significant efforts on the Mono feature._

### Async/await and dynamic

The Roslyn CTP currently does not support `async/await` or the `dynamic` keyword. With the mono engine support, we are now enabling you to use async/await AND dynamic via Mono's compiler, even in Windows on the .NET runtime. 
- If you run on Mac or Linux, it will just work.
- On Windows, force the Mono engine by passing `-modules mono` when you run scriptcs i.e. `scriptcs.exe dynamic.csx -modules mono`

#### Examples

**async/await**

``` csharp
#r System.Net.Http
using System.Net.Http;

public async Task DumpRequestAsync() {
    var client = new HttpClient();
    var response = await client.GetAsync(""http://www.yahoo.com"");
    Console.WriteLine(response);
}

DumpRequestAsync().Wait();
```

**dynamic**

``` csharp
using System.Dynamic;

dynamic foo = new ExpandoObject();
foo.bar = ""bar"";
Console.WriteLine(foo.bar);
```

### Custom REPL commands

One of the popular requests we've received is to be able to introduce custom commands in the REPL. We've now introduced [commands](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/tree/dev/src/ScriptCs.Core/ReplCommands) like `:clear`, `:cwd` and `:install` which you can use right from within the REPL! For example `:install` will let you install packages directly. 

The best part is you can now author your own commands which can be installed as part of a [Module](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Modules)! You just need to implement [`IReplCommand`](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/blob/dev/src/ScriptCs.Contracts/IReplCommand.cs). scriptcs will find it! See our in the box commands to get a sense of how to implement your own.

_Special thanks to [Kyle Roatch](https://github.com/kroatch) for his spiking which laid the ground work for this feature._

### Runtime binding redirects

A major pain we've had in previous releases related to versioning conflicts. This was usually due to one of the following reasons:
- A script relies on nuget packages which scriptcs itself also uses. The packages may be binary compatible, but as the versions differ, you get a type mismatch.
- scriptcs is hosted in an app that has conflicting dependencies with scriptcs's dependencies.
- A script pack is compiled against a different version of a package then what scriptcs itself uses.

In the standard .NET world, this is generally handled by binding redirects in app.config. In the scriptcs world however we've had no solution as the only app.config is for scriptcs itself. In this release w're introducing dynamic runtime binding redirects. This will automatically redirect any references to an earlier version of a dependency to the latest version. This will solve a bunch of problems and generally cause less failures due to conflicts, something that was particularly common with older script packs. The one caveat is if there are true binary conflicts i.e the signatures of methods have changed, or been removed. In these cases this is not related strictly to the version number, so the redirect functionality won't help.

### File watching

In previous releases, if you are editing a script and want it to reload, you need to kill scriptcs and re-run. Taking a hint from tools like mocha in the node world, scriptcs now supports file watching. Using the `-watch` parameter, scriptcs will execute your script in a separate `AppDomain`. It will then monitor any changes to the entry point script, and if there is a change it will tear down the AppDomain and re-execute the script. If you want to work with dependent scripts, you can use tools like `touch` to modify the main script after you make edits to the other scripts.

_Special thanks to [Lucian Bargaoanu](https://github.com/lbargaoanu) for implementing this feature_

#### Example

``` text
C:\src\test> scriptcs watched.csx -watch
scriptcs (ctrl-c to exit)
Running script 'watched.csx' and watching for changes...
I am watched
Script changed. Reloading...
I am watched again
```

### Console Mirroring

Using the new `-Output` switch you can now mirror input and output in from a script OR in the REPL to a file.  This is very useful for debugging or for automation scripts.

## Known issues
- Modules are no longer being loaded from the bin folder even if you specify `-debug`. This is a bug and should be fixed in the next release.
- Runnng the REPL in the scriptcs source folder will throw an exception when you try to run some code. This only happens as far as we can tell in that folder.
