- Released on NPM as [**selectize**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selectize) (#60, #604)
- Added support for using `dataAttr`to hydrate a text input element: `<input type=""text"" data-data=""[{...},{...}]"">` (#155, #231, #522)
- Added `splitOn` setting that allows pasted text to be broken up into items (#425, @jhash)
- Added `removeOptionGroup`, `clearOptionGroups` methods (#669)
- Added `closeAfterSelect` setting (#344)
- Added `$item` argument to `item_remove` event (#585)
- Added `focus`, `blur` events (plus `onFocus`, `onBlur`callbacks)
- Added ability to pass callback to `createItem` (for use with async option creation)
- Updated [sifter.js](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js) to [0.4.0](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
  - Text sorting is now locale-aware.
  - Added Polish diacritics: łŁ

**Bugfixes**
- Don't allow tabbing/focus to selectize control that is disabled (#583, #307)
- Don't propagate ESC keypress when closing menu – for when selectize is used in modals (#672)
- Set option labels on original, hidden `<select>` element (#512)
- Improved focus, blur handling (particularly IE)
- Disabled validity API (""required"" prop) on Android. Support for it is too erratic currently.
- Allow tabbing to next control when control is full (#629)
- Render functions can now return strings that start w/newline characters (#645)
- Fixed grunt module building on Windows (#453)

**Breaking Changes**
- Made `addOption`, `addOptionGroup` add implicit `$order` property (if not already set). The property used to only be added to options populated from the DOM (#640, #381, #499, #198)
- Removed `optgroupOrder` setting. Constraining the option group render order is now achieved by setting `lockOptgroupOrder: true`. To customize the order, set the `$order` property on each item in your `optgroups` array

#### Multi-Property Sorting

With the new [sifter](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js) v0.3 integration, you can now sort results by multiple fields. The `""sortDirection""` setting has been removed.

``` js
sortField: [
    {field: 'first_name', direction: 'asc'},
    {field: 'last_name', direction: 'asc'}
]
```

##### Special Fields

<table width=""100%"">
    <tr>
        <td valign=""top""><code>""$score""</code></td>
        <td width=""100%"">A number representing how good of a match an item is for the current search.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign=""top""><code>""$order""</code></td>
        <td>The original index of an option in a &lt;select&gt; before selectize was initialized.</td>
    </tr>

- [**Modularized components.**](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/bower.json#L32) Separates concerns, improves testability, allows development to diverge, and allows code to be shared with other libraries.
  - [sifter](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js) — Filtering and sorting.
  - [microplugin](https://github.com/brianreavis/microplugin.js) — Plugin system.
- [**LESS Stylesheets.**](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/tree/master/dist/less) With a comprehensive set of variables, skinning is orders of magnitude easier. Furthermore, plugins can take advantage of theme-specific settings.
  - Added shims for [Bootstrap 2](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/tree/master/dist/less/selectize.bootstrap2.less) and [Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/tree/master/dist/less/selectize.bootstrap3.less).
- All build files now live in the [""dist""](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/tree/master/dist) folder.
- New [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)-based build system.

#### API
- Added `destroy()` method (#35).
- Removed the `""theme""` setting. All it did was add an extra class to the control. If you want the same functionality, just add a class to the `<select>` you're selectizing.
- Removed the need to pass the value when adding options via `addOption(value, data)`. Now it's simple: `addOption(data)`. The value is extracted from the data automatically, according to the `""valueField""` setting.
