## Breaking Changes

#### Removed IamPolicyLambdaExecution Resource

We've removed the `IamPolicyLambdaExecution` resource template and replaced it with inline policy within the role as it's been causing issues with VPC and bloating the CF template. This is a breaking change only for users who are depending on that resource with `Ref` or similar CF intrinsic functions.

#### Changed displayed function name for `sls info`

The function name displayed when you run `sls info` is now the short function name as found in `serverless.yml` rather than the actual lambda name to keep it more provider agnostic. This could be breaking for any user who is depending or parsing the CLI output.

## Breaking Changes

### CloudWatch logs are created explicitly

Up until this release, CloudWatch log groups were created implicitly by AWS/Lambda by default and were not included in your service stack. However, some users were able to easily reach the CloudWatch log group limits (currently at 500 log groups), and it wasn't an easy task to clear them all. Because of that we decided to explicitly create the log groups using CloudFormation so that you can easily remove them with `sls remove`. This was also optionally possible with the `cfLogs: true` config option.

If your service doesn't have the `cfLogs: true` set, and one of the function has been invoked at least once (hence the log groups were created implicitly by AWS), then it's very likely that you'll receive a ""log group already exists"" error after upgrading to v1.6.0. That's because CF is now trying to create the already created log groups from scratch to include it in the stack resources. **To fix this breaking change,** simply delete the old log group, or rename your service if you **must** keep the old logs.

### Removed function Arns from CloudFormation outputs

Up until this release, the output section of the generated CloudFormation template included an output resource for each function Arn. This caused deploying big services to fail because users were hitting the 60 outputs per stack limit. This effectively means that you can't have a service that has more than 60 functions. To avoid this AWS limit, we decided to remove those function output resources completely, to keep the stack clean. This also means removing the function Arns from the `sls info` command, and at the end of the deployment command.

This is a breaking change for your project if you're depending on those function output resources in anyway, or if you're depending on function arn outputs from the deploy or info commands. Otherwise, your project shouldn't be affected by this change. Fixing this issue depends on your needs, but just remember that you can always create your own CF outputs in `serverless.yml`.

### Moved `getStackName()` method

This is a breaking change for plugin authors only. If your plugin used the `provider.getStackName()` method, it has been moved to `naming.js`, and should be referenced with `provider.naming.getStackName()` instead.

### Removed the `defaults` property from `serverless.yml`

We've finally dropped support for the `defaults` property which we introduced in v1. All child properties should now be moved to the `provider` object instead.

## Future breaking changes

We will include the LogGroup for your Lambda function in the CloudFormation template in the future. This will break deployments to existing applications because the log group was already created. You will get a warning about this if you deploy currently. We will force this behaviour in a future release, for now you can set it through the `cfLogs: true` parameter in your provider config. This change will also limit the logging rights to only this LogGroup, which should have no impact on your environment. You can read more in [our docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/functions#log-group-resources).

- The HTTP Event now uses the [recently released Lambda Proxy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-set-up-simple-proxy.html#api-gateway-proxy-integration-types) by default. This requires you to change your handler result to fit the new proxy integration. You can also switch back to the old integration type.
- The Cloudformation Name of APIG paths that have a variable have changed, so if you have a variable in a path and redeploy CF will throw an error. To fix this remove the path and readd it a second deployment.

We are trying our best to keep up and offer a better user experience on top of everything without introducing breaking changes.  But this release contains a few.

#### Breaking - Unique Function Names Required

All of your functions must have unique names project-wide.  For example, `users/show` should become `users/usersShow`.  Serverless will throw an error on initialization if your function names are not unique.

**How to upgrade:** Change your function names to be unique.

#### Breaking - Removed Components While Keeping and Improving Its Functionality

We've removed the concept of Components and instead improved our nested folders functionality to give you complete control over how you want to structure your project. As a result there's no `s-component.json` anymore, and the runtime is managed at the function level. So your `s-function.json` should now have a runtime property with the value `nodejs` or `python2.7`. That also means that you can create a function in the root of your project directly with `sls function create myFunc` or you can nested as much as you want with `sls function create functions/subfolder/myFunc`.  If you have settings on `s-component.json` they will no longer be applicable.  We recommend using Project Templates to store any `s-component.json` settings instead.

This change affects the default function name we give to your functions when they are deployed.  This will cause issues when you upgrade from `V0.4` to `V0.5` as your functions will be renamed when deployed on AWS.

**How to upgrade:** Redeploy your functions.  We also recommend taking advantage of the `customName` property in `s-function.json` if you aren't already.  The new default function name when deployed is simply `project-function`.

#### Flexible Dependency Management via Magic Handlers

Now that you have complete control over how you organize your functions, we've come up with the concept of ""magic handlers"" to give you more control on what you want to be deployed along with your function and how you want to handle function dependencies. We're referring to the handler property of the `s-function.json` file. Depending on which parent folder this handler path is relative to, your lambda function will be zipped up from that parent folder and deployed to AWS.

By default the handler is set to `handler.handler`. That means it's only relative to the function folder, so only the function folder will be deployed to Lambda. If however you want to include the parent subfolder of a function, you should change the handler to be like this: `myFunc/handler.handler`. As you can see, the path to the handler now includes the function folder, which means that the path is now relative to the parent subfolder, so in that case the parent subfolder will be deployed along with your function. So if you have a `lib` folder in that parent subfolder that is required by your function, it'll be deployed with your function. This also gives you the ability to handle npm dependencies however you like. If you have a `package.json` and `node_modules` in that parent subfolder, it'll be included in the deployed lambda. So the more parent folders you include in the handler path, the upper you go in the file tree.

#### Breaking - Multiple s-resources-cf.json files

We are removing the ability to have resources nested in your function subfolders.  The reason for this is we have received a lot of feedback that resources should be broken up into separate, smaller resource stacks, instead of one resource stack defined by separate resource files.  This follows microservice patterns more closely, with resource separation per microservice.  We are considering implementing this in the near future.

**How to upgrade:** Merge your s-resources-cf.json files into a single file that is kept at the root of your project.

#### Breaking - Removal Of Project Buckets, Changing Environment Variable Handling

Project buckets were more useful when we started Serverless/JAWS several months ago.  However, AWS continues to improve Lambda, making Project Buckets less relevant.  As a result, we've decided to remove them, to reduce complexity.  This will break how your project handles Environment Variables, since they used to be stored in Project Buckets. 

**How to upgrade:** You will need to transfer your environment variables from S3 to your `s-function.json` files.  Environment variables are now stored in an `environment` object, in your `s-function.json` file, like this:

```
""environment"": {
    ""MY_ENV_VAR"": ""VALUE""
}
```

However, we recommend not putting Environment Variable values in the `environment` object, and only putting in Serverless Project Variables as values instead.  This allows your Env Variables to be different per stage and stage+region within your project.  It also isolates all sensitive data to your `_meta` folder, which you should now always `.gitignore`.

```
""environment"": {
    ""MY_ENV_VAR"": ""${env_myenvvar}"" // Kept in _meta/variables and changes depending on stage/region
}
```

Over the next few days, we will introduce a plugin that will help developers working on the same project sync their _meta folder across teams, securely via S3.  Until then, make sure you `.gitignore` your `_meta` folder in your existing project.

#### Serverless-Helpers-JS No Longer Needed

The [serverless-helpers-js module](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-helpers-js) is no longer needed.  Environment variables are automatically inlined into your function when they are run locally AND deployed.  This is done by switching your handler with another one on FunctionRun and FunctionDeploy.  The handler is titled `_serverless_handler` and it contains your Environment Variables.

#### Added Support for Multiple AWS Accounts for Your Stages

You can now have a new aws account/profile for each of your stages, making it more efficient to work with big teams. When you create a new stage, you will be prompted for which profile to use with that stage.  You can create a new profile at this time as well.

#### Added API Gateway Custom Authorizers Support

API Gateway custom authorizers now allow you to call a Lambda function containing authorization logic, before calling the lambda function containing your application logic.  This is called a custom authorizer.  

We've added support for this new API Gateway feature into the Framework and improved the user experience.  Here is how it works:

The Function that you want to be an authorizer (runs the authorization logic) must have a `authorizer` property in its `s-function.json` wth these properties:

```
""name"": ""auth"",
""authorizer"": {
    ""type"": ""TOKEN"",
    ""identitySource"": ""method.request.header.Authorization""
},
```

Endpoints that require that custom authorizer must contain these properties:

```
""authorizationType"": ""CUSTOM"",
""authorizerFunction"": ""auth"", // Name of the function in your project that does authorization 
```

#### Function Deploy Is Now 2x Faster

Previously, we used to backup your lambda functions on the project S3 bucket whenever you deploy a function, which slowed down the deployment. We did this to get extra space in case you reached the 1.5GB lambda limit, which is easily reachable with versioning. But since AWS announced it's increasing the quote to be 75GB instead of 1.5GB, we decided it's time to ditch this functionality and keep FunctionDeploy fast.

#### Added 5 New Actions

**Function Remove** `sls function remove`: This action removes a function from your AWS account along with any Endpoints and Events tied to your function. For more info about this new action [checkout the v0.5 docs](http://docs.serverless.com/v0.5.0/docs/function-remove).

**Endpoint Remove** `sls endpoint remove`: This action removes an endpoint from your AWS account. For more info about this new action [checkout the v0.5 docs](http://docs.serverless.com/v0.5.0/docs/endpoint-remove).

**Event Remove** `sls event remove`: This action removes an event from your AWS account. For more info about this new action [checkout the v0.5 docs](http://docs.serverless.com/v0.5.0/docs/event-remove).

**Function Rollback** `sls function rollback`: This action rolls your function back to a previously deployed version. For more info about this new action [checkout the v0.5 docs](http://docs.serverless.com/v0.5.0/docs/function-rollback).

**Resources Diff** `sls resources diff`: This action outputs the differences between your deployed resources and the resources currently defined in your project locally. For more info about this new action [checkout the v0.5 docs](http://docs.serverless.com/v0.5.0/docs/resources-diff).

#### Introducing Runtimes.  Plus, You Can Add your Own Runtimes

All Runtime logic is now isolated to Runtime-specific classes.  They are available on the serverless instance in the classes property.  You can add your own Runtime through a plugin by simply adding a new Runtime class to the main Serverless instance.  We've already created a custom babe runtime, which you can reference here:  https://github.com/serverless/serverless-runtime-babel  When you install this plugin, you will have a `babel` runtime option.  It supports scaffolding babel functions, running them locally, and deploying them with optional optimizations.

#### Removed Function/Endpoint/Event Paths Concept

To make our CLI easier to use, we've removed the concept of Function/Endpoint/Event paths. Instead, the names of these assets should be unique project wide. This way, you can simply run `sls function deploy myFunc` instead of `sls function deploy path/to/myFunc`. Names are what we use to identify Functions/Endpoints/Events. 

Although Endpoints don't have a name property, the endpoint name is simply the combination of the endpoint path with the endpoint method separated by `~` symbol, which is always unique project wide. (ie. `user/create~GET`). This combination is always unique project wide, and we call it the Endpoint Name. It's also worth noting that the only time you'll be required to enter a function path is with `sls function create`, because in this particular case you're not just specifying the function name, but also the location of the function you want to create inside your project.

#### Added VPC Support

We've added support for VPC immediately after AWS announced VPC support for lambda. There's a new property in the `s-function.json` file called `vpc` that looks like this:

```
""vpc"": {
    ""securityGroupIds"": [],
    ""subnetIds"": []
  }
```

This is where you can configure your VPC configurations for this lambda. For more info, [checkout this issue](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/629)

#### Improved Event Sources Configuration

We've improved event sources support for Scheduled and S3 events. You can now specify input parameters for scheduled lambdas by adding a new property in the `config` object called `input`, which is just a JSON object to be passed to your lambda. For S3 events, you can now specify `filterRules` in the `config` object to filter the events that trigger your lambda. It should look like this:

```
""name"" : ""myS3Event"",
""type"": ""s3"",
""config"": {
  ""bucket"": ""${testEventBucket}"",
  ""bucketEvents"": [""s3:ObjectCreated:*""],
  ""filterRules"" : [
      {
          ""name"" : ""prefix | suffix"",
          ""value"" : ""STRING_VALUE""
      }
   ]
}
```

#### Breaking - Changed Plugin Loading

The way plugins load has been changed slightly.  Instead of passing in a `ServerlessClass` to the plugin, we pass in the entire `Serverless` instance.  This allows plugin authors to manipulate the classes Serverless offers, for complete extensibility.

**How to upgrade:** Some plugins will not work until they are updated.  The Optimizer plugin, the S3-Client plugin have already been upgraded.  Please review this improved section on Plugin Creation within our documentation to quickly update your plugin http://docs.serverless.com/v0.5.0/docs/plugins

#### Breaking - Powerful New Classes and Methods for Plugin Authors

We've completely rewritten our codebase and made it more object oriented by creating powerful classes for each of our assets. So now there's a Serverless, Project, Function, Endpoint, Event, Stage, Region, Resources, Variables, Templates and ProviderAws classes. Each of which contain some powerful methods that make it really easy to add custom functionality to the framework. Notice that we removed the State class and we're instead accessing the project using the Project class.  For help on this, please check out the improved section on Plugin Creation within our documentation:  http://docs.serverless.com/v0.5.0/docs/plugins

## Updates

### Event Support

We're now supporting 4 types of event sources:
- **Streams (DynamoDB & Kinesis)**
- **S3**
- **SNS** 
- **Schedule**

You can configure your event sources in the `events` property of your `s-function.json`. The events property is an array of event objects (each function can have multiple events, just like endpoints), and each event object has a `name`, `type` and `config` properties. [You can see an example of each supported event source in this test function](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/tests/test-prj/nodejscomponent/group1/function1/s-function.json#L10-L40). You can deploy your configured events in the `s-function.json` with the new `sls event deploy` action just like deploying Endpoints.  

A likely pattern will be to have one Component for your REST API and another Component for your Events:

```
project
   api
   events
```

More information on event support is in the [Documentation](http://docs.serverless.com/v0.4.0/docs/event-deploy).

### Removal Of Modules Concept

There is no longer any concept of Modules within the Framework.  `s-modules.json` is something we will no longer use.  This is for the sake of simplicity.

Instead, you can put functions in the root of your Component, or 1-2 subfolders within a Component.  For example:

```
project/component/function
project/component/subfolder/function
project/component/subfolder/subfolder2/function
```

You are able to have duplicate function names, however we believe it is a best practice to ensure you have unique names across all of your functions.

If you have `s-modules.json` in your project, we will continue to support those, but we advise you to change them into `s-resources-cf.json` files.  An explanation on how to do that is in the next note.

### Changing Handling Of Resources

Inserting CloudFormation syntax into `s-project.json` was getting too crowded.  We will still support this, but we encourage you to create a `s-resources-cf.json` file in the root of your project instead, and copy everything into that.  Project Templates and Variables can still be used in this file and it is NOT meant to upload directly to AWS CloudFormation.

Since we got rid of `s-modules.json` and those also used to contain CloudFormation syntax, we now allow you to put more `s-resources-cf.json` files in the root of your Components and the root of your Component subfolders (1 level deep).  This allows you to keep your resources near the application logic that uses it.  Please note the `s-resources-cf.json` that is nested in your Project assets must use different root propeties.  (Full details on that are available here)[http://docs.serverless.com/v0.4.0/docs/resources]

### Custom Function Names

Every `s-function.json` file can now have a `customName` property.  This will be the name of your deployed Lambda function on AWS.  In this property, you can use Project Variables:

```
“customName”: “${project}-${stage}-${name}”
```

You can even use Project Templates AND Variables to specify a function name template, like this:

Put a `""functionName"": ""${project}-${stage}-${name}""` key in `s-templates.json` in the root of your project. `${name}` is a reserved Project Variable and is always populated with the name property in the current configuration file. Then in `s-function.json`, put this: `""customName"": ""$${functionName}""`.

### Custom Lambda Roles

You can now add custom IAM Roles to your Lambda functions via the `customRole` property in `s-function.json`.  Make sure you put the ARN for the Role in here.

### Function Run Local & Deployed Functions

If you provide a stage and region options to `sls function run`, the command will **invoke** your deployed function rather than running it locally.

### Function Logs w/ Optional Tailing

`sls function logs` fetches lambda function logs from CloudWatch.  You can also use the tailling option to continuously stream logs in the CLI.  (Full details are available here)[http://docs.serverless.com/v0.4.0/docs/function-logs]

### DashDeploy Improvements

Dash Deploy has lots of new hotkeys thatnks to @jordanmack

### Update Dependencies

Our dependencies have been updated to address security concerns

**Note To Plugin Developers:**
- If you are using the ServerlessModule class in your plugin, you will need to remove that code.
- ServerlessComponent, ServerlessFunction, ServerlessEndpoint and ServerlessEvent class constructor now rely completely on the provided `sPath` option rather than the `component`, `function`, `endpoint` config options combined. We believe this is much simpler, and we're trying to make the `sPath` the standard convention for referencing assets in the Serverless Framework.

**Note To Plugin Developers:**  This version changes the names of two Actions:
-  `CodePackageLambdaNodeJs -> CodePackageLambda`
- `CodeDeployLambdaNodeJs -> CodeDeployLambda`.  
  Those operations will handle ALL Lambda runtimes.  This change may affect some plugins, but will not affect any Serverless Projects.  The [Serverless Optimizer Plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-optimizer-plugin) is affected by this change, but has already been updated to support Serverless Framework `v0.2.0`.  If your project uses the Optimizer plugin, please update it to work with this release of Serverless.

### Python Support

Long-awaited Python support is here, thanks to the uber-talented @ryansb of [Serverless Code](https://serverlesscode.com/).  We are updating our documentation with Python usage information.  Please test it out and let us know what you think.  @ryansb is an authority on Serverless Architectures.  Check out [Serverless Code](https://serverlesscode.com/) if you haven't already. 

### Dash Summary

A new command `serverless dash summary` shows a summary of your project (e.g., stages, regions, components and more!).  

### Function Run Improvements

You can now specify a Stage and Region in `serverless function run` and Serverless will fetch your ENV vars from your Project Bucket and use those in your local function.

## Updates

### Templates

You can now add `s-templates.json` files to the root of your Project, Components, Modules and Functions.  Even better, you can inherit templates from parent level template files and extend them in sub-template files.  For example:

```
// project/s-templates.json
{
  ""apiRequestTemplate"": {
    ""application/json"": {
      ""httpMethod"": ""$context.httpMethod""
    }
  }
}

// project/component/module/functions-template.json
{
  ""apiRequestTemplate"": {
    ""application/json"": {
      ""pathId"": ""$input.params('id')""
    }
  }
}

// This will populate the function endpoint's request template with the merged template:
{
  ""apiRequestTemplate"": {
    ""application/json"": {
      ""httpMethod"": ""$context.httpMethod"",
      ""pathId"": ""$input.params('id')""
    }
  }
}
```

You can use templates in an `s-.json` files and they will inherit/extend themselves intelligently.  The [Serverless-Starter](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless-starter) project has been updated to show examples of useful template inheritance.

### More Class Methods

Many classes now have additional methods which you can call to get their parent assets.  For example, ServerlessFunction has:

```
.getModule()
.getComponent()
.getProject()
```

## Bug Fixes

### Template Inheritance Bug

In `v0.1.3` templates do not inherit subjectively by the assets that were calling them.

## Updates

### Templates

You can now specify templates in your project root folder by creating files that start with `s-template...`.  For example, you can have `project/s-templates-cloudFormation.json` or `project/s-templates-apiGateway.json`.  You can still have templates in the root of your module folders.  However, this syntax is no longer supported for module-level templates `$${moduleName.template}`.  Instead, you specify both Project and Module templates like this: `$${template}`.  If a template key is duplicated in a Project template and a Module template, the module template will not replace, but extend the project level template, increasing reusability and customization.  The [documentation](http://docs.serverless.com) on this has been updated on our website.

### ServerlessState

Added a `setAsset()` method which allows you to automagically pass in an instance of a Project, Component, Module, Function or Endpoint and it will set it in the right location of the project instance that is within the state instance.  /cc @ryansb @joostFarla

### DashDeploy

You can now use this in your project's root folder.  It shows different content depending on which folder you are in.

### StageCreate, RegionCreate

Automatically deploy resources on creation (like we used to).

### Region ENV Variable

A `SERVERLESS_REGION` variable is now auto-created whenever you create a new Stage/Region

### Bug Fixes
- Improved readability for people using terminals with white backgrounds
- Runtime properties have been removed from `s-function.json` and `s-module.json`

## Other Notes

### [Serverless-Starter](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless-starter)

Serverless Projects are now shareable and this is the first.  Serverless-Starter is a simple boilerplate project that showcase a couple different ways you can organize your REST API.  It's also preloaded with the Optimizer plugin and other useful things like templates.

### [Serverless-Optimizer-Plugin](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless-optimizer-plugin)

The babel support has been finished.  You can now use the serverless-optimizer-plugin to bring ES6 to your Lambda functions via Babel!

- **IMPORTANT: Lambda Logging Bug Fix:**  If you created a project with V0.1.0 or V0.1.1, a typo prevents your Lambda function from having permission to write to CloudWatch logs.  This can be fixed by following the instructions by @lorenzos in #495.  Make sure you delete your project's CloudFormation stack, then run `serverless resources deploy` to recreate it with the new IAM Policy. Thanks @lorenzos!
- **New Project Install Command:**  In `v0.1` Serverless Projects are now shareable.  The only thing that was missing was a command to install them.  This is the first pass at this command and it's still in testing.

The architecture in `v0.1.` represents the best possible approach for building AWS Lambda powered applications.

In this release there are several breaking changes.  We apologize for this and we sincerely believe these are the last breaking changes.  Fortunately, we make these changes to offer you a substantially better workflow, and the improvements in `v0.1` will save you a lot of time in the long run.

To transition, we recommend creating a new project with Serverless `v0.1.0` and moving your project assets to the new project.  Any breaking changes listed below include notes on how to move your assets over to the new project:
-  **Breaking Change - Single Project Bucket:**   The framework now creates a single bucket on `sls project create` to hold all project data for all regions and stages, instead of creating a multiple buckets for each region your project uses.  This has been a request for a long time and we've finally made it happen.  The downside is existing projects will have to aggregate their regional buckets to the new single Project Bucket.  By creating a new Serverless project, you will have the correct bucket naming convention -- `serverless.<region>.<domain>` -- but make sure you copy assets over to the new Bucket Key Structure, which is:

```
serverless/<projectName>/<stage>/lambdas // lambda back-ups
serverless/<projectName>/<stage>/<region>/<envVars> // ENV vars
serverless/<projectName>/<stage>/<region>/<resources> // CF Resources
```
- **Project Variables:**  To reduce configuration settings across your project we now have Project Variables.  You can use a Project Variable in any `s-project.json, s-component.json, s-module.json and s-function.json` file via this syntax: `${variable}`  Project Variables can be different for stages and their regions, which make them exceptionally powerful.  In general, we recommend keeping all of your AWS account specific data in Project Variables. 
- **Breaking Change - _meta folder:**   This is a new folder in the root of your project which holds your Project Variables as well as copies of entire CloudFormation Templates that are produced as a result of aggregating all of the CloudFormation properties across your `s-project.json` and `s-modules.json`.  The Serverless Framework keeps your project stages and regions data in here as well, in the form of folders.  In each folder are `s-variable.json` files for storing stage and region specific Project Variables.  By `.gitignoring` your `_meta` folder, you can share your project publicly! 
- **Breaking Change - Components:**   There is a new tier of organization in Serverless projects to help dependency management and allow for multiple runtimes within a single project, these are called _Components_.  Components designate a runtime (e.g., node.js) and contain a single list of dependencies that is shared across multiple modules and functions (e.g., a single `package.json`).  This allows your modules and functions to all use one set of dependencies, which greatly reduces dependency management and maintenance.  Components sit between your project and groups of modules.  You can think of Components as microservices.  A common pattern is to have 1 component containing modules and functions for a REST API, and another component for modules and functions that respond to events on your AWS account.  This could look like this:

```
project/restAPI-component-nodejs/modules/functions
project/eventHandlers-component-python/modules/functions // Python support is almost finished!
```
- **Breaking Change - Plugin Package.json in Project root:**  Every Serverless project now expects a `package.json` in the root of your project, which contains plugin dependencies.  This was previously located in `project/plugins/package.json`, but now is at `project/package.json`.  This was a heavily demanded feature and we hope it makes everyone's workflows much better.
- **Breaking Change - Resource Management:**  There is no longer a `resources-cf.json` file containing your Serverless Project's resources.  Instead, you modify resources in the `cloudformation` properties of `s-project.json` and `s-modules.json`.  When you run `serverless resources deploy`, Serverless aggregates CF resources from your modules and project, then prints a `s-resources.json` file in your `_meta/resources` and updates CloudFormation based on that file.  You can use `serverless resources deploy -c` to not trigger the  CloudFormation update and only print the `s-resources.json` file.
- **Templates:** To further reduce configuration settings in `s-module.json` and `s-function.json` we now offer reusable templates.  Templates can be any data type (e.g., objects).  They are defined in `s-templates.json` located at the root of your modules: `project/component1/module1/s-templates.json`.  To use a template that is located within a module, use similar syntax to our new Project Variables: `$${moduleName.template}`.  By including the _moduleName_ you can use templates located in other modules.  We've almost completed templates at the project level `project/s-templates.json` which you will specify without the module name, like `$${templateName}`, but we didn't quite finish it before releasing.  If anyone wants to help finish this feature, that would be greatly appreciated :)
- **Stage Create & Region Create:**  When these are created, your CloudFormation resources are no longer deployed by default.  You must run `serverless resources deploy` for those new stages/regions.
- **Dash Deploy Must Be Used Within Modules**:  The Serverless CLI Deployment Dashboard does not work well with long lists of Lambda functions, so you currently can only run it from within a module folder.
- **Temporary Removal Of Module Install:**  We've temporarily removed the module install command so that it will work with our new shareable module design.  This will be back shortly.
- **Breaking Change - Deployed Function Names Now Include Component Name:** To avoid conflicts across deployed lambda functions in multiple project components, deployed lambda names now include the component which they reside within, in your project.
- **Breaking Change For Plugins - Introducing Serverless Classes:**  To provide a better experience for plugin developers, we have stopped attaching large objects to the `evt` objects that are passed to every Action and Hook.  Instead, we now pass only Serverless Paths to identify modules/functions/endpoints the Action should work with.  Most importantly, we now have great new classes for Plugin Developers to use when making plugins.  We have classes for Serverless Project, Component, Module, Function, Endpoint and more!  Each class is full of useful methods which Plugin Developers can use to build faster.  Even better, there is a new Serverless State class.  This is instantiated each time an Action is run via the CLI or when calling `serverless.init()` programatically.  This State class contains the most methods for Plugin development.  These new Classes and their methods represent a stabler API for Plugin developers to rely on, and they are super powerful.  Please read more about them in our [documentation](http://docs.serverless.com).

We are stabilizing quickly and we're sorry for these.  We believe these will be some of the last.  Here is what you must change:

# Breaking Changes & How To Fix Them
- **s-function.json:** The `s-function.json` format had to be amended slightly to improve handling multiple endpoints per function.  The `endpoints` property used to be an object with the endpoint's path as the key.  Now, the `endpoints` property is an array of endpoint objects, and a `path` property has been added to each object.  Please make this change to all of your `s-function.json` files.
- **resources-cf.json:** Since AWS CloudFormation recently added support for grouping and customizing parameter ordering and labeling, we decided to strip the `aa` prefix on the Parameters in the `resources-cf.json`.  We recommend changing the Parameters in your `resources-cf.json` and deployed Serverless Project Resources to remove the `aa` prefixes.  From this point on, use the grouping, customizing parameter ordering and labeling to stay organized.  See #369 for more information.
- **Serverless Plugins:**  We believe the Plugin system is now very stable after this last minor change.  The first parameter to pass into your Plugin is not a path, but the ServerlessPlugin class.  Now, you don't have to load it yourself.  The second parameter is the path.  See #368 for more information.  The [Serverless Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-plugin-boilerplate) has also been updated to work with this change.

# New Features
- **Dash is back!** The deploy dashboard is back.  Run `serverless dash deploy` to deploy both functions and endpoints in one screen.  Since command line interfaces are buggy, make sure your terminal window is as tall as possible if you have a lot of functions and endpoints.
- **Many fixes:** Multiple endpoints work better, thanks to the breaking change above.  We've also fixed the `requestParameters` issue reported in #366 : We've started making lots of changes to help with Windows use, but we still have some more to make.  However, we did fix #365.  Please let us know of other compatibility issues :)

- FunctionRun, FunctionDeploy, EndpointDeploy all have new select menus when running their commands in the CLI.  You can run the bare commands and select which functions/endpoints you would like to use for that operation.  Overall, lots of better UX in the CLI for these Actions.
- When creating a new function, the function name is persisted as a property in the event.json
- FunctionRun you can now specify a single function by its path or name when running this command.  This will save you from going through the select menu each time.
- The `s-project.json`, `s-module.json` and `s-function.json` files now have a `custom` property where plugins can store and check custom data.  The `package` property in `s-function.json` was changed to `custom`.  This will result in backward compatibility issues if your Project's `s-function.json` files still feature the `package` property.
- The `ServerlessPlugin.js` class has more convenience methods for Plugins to use.  We've added 2 convenience methods.  One prompts the user to select functions found in the current working directory, the other does the same but for endpoints.  Also, the convenience method names have been changed, which would normally result in breaking plugins, but we don't have any plugins yet so we can get away with it :)
