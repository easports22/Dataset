- Migrated the library to be using NSAttributedString underneath. The `text` property on `SLKTextView` uses a NSAttributedString representation based on its font and text color, and doesn't forward to super. By @jacywu07 (https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController/pull/501)
- As part of the migration to NSAttributedString, new helpers for attributed strings have been added to `SLKTextView+SLKAdditions`.
- Introduced a new API to end users to open the auto-completion mode with a given prefix. By @jacywu07 (https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController/pull/506)
- Exposed the private `cacheTextView` method. By @acandelaria1 (https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController/pull/513)

- Updated the sample project to Swift 3! By @cyhsutw (https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController/pull/522) 
- Added a property to allow the user to set how many lines of text SLKTextView's placeholder should have. By @jedmund (https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController/pull/505)

##### Features & Enhancements:
- Better Swift 2.2 support with nullability annotations and shiny new Swift sample code. You rock @weijentu 🙇 
- Introduced `SLKTextInput` protocol: A `UITextInput` extension to decouple all the text processing features related to auto-completion, to reuse in any text component such as UISearchBar, UITextField, UITextView, etc.
- Added a new API `-shouldProcessTextForAutoCompletion` to be able to opt-out from text processing for auto-completion.
- The `registeredPrefixes` property are now of type NSSet (instead of NSArray).
- Added animation to views when switching from a keyboard to a custom input view. Thanks @cyhsutw!
- Made `keyboardStatus` public, making it easier to check for the current keyboard state.

##### Hot Fixes:
- Fixed a use case where the textInput would not follow the keyboard when dismissing.
- Improved text caching from the textInput, specially when moving the app to the background (in case the app crashes while being on the background).
- Fixed misaligned placeholder labels in the textView and out of bounds.

- The auto-completion view is now presented above of the table/collection view avoiding to push it up/down every time. Much better UX!
- Stored all key commands in a instance variable, to avoid recreating the array at every character update.

##### Hot Fixes:

- Fixed the right button from stretching when animating the constrains. This was broken since iOS 9.
- Improved `UITabBar` support by considering `hidesBottomBarWhenPushed` too.
- Fixed crash when double tapping the space bar while the textView was empty.

- Gonna get a nice warning to remind you to `super` in `viewDidLoad` now. Fancy! 
- Slowed down bouncy animation by 0.15 seconds
- Disabled `cellLayoutMarginsFollowReadableWidth` on iOS 9 for the auto-completion view. No need for large margins, come on!

- Added customization hooks to override the char counter colors and layout.
- Added a new char counter countdown style. Thanks @johannth! 
- Added basic unit tests with Travis CI and Coveralls support.
- Deprecated the `shouldForceTextInputbarAdjustment` property. It has now be replaced by the `-forceTextInputbarAdjustmentForResponder:` overridable method to allow a more selective verification of when the text input bar should adjust even when it is not the first responder.

- Fixed an issue with third-party (Swiftkey) keyboards not forwarding events properly sometimes.
- Improved how text caret selection/movement is really detected, not using UITextViewDelegate anymore (not reliable enough).

- Disabled animation in the textview placeholder's layout cycle.
- Fixed the send button not being disabled/hidden after sending a message.
- Fixed several issues regarding auto-completion vs auto-correction on iOS 8.3
- Fixed autocomplete on Japanese keyboards.
- Fixed crash on iOS7 caused by a misused auto-layout API.
- Hot fixes for iOS7 base SDK. Thanks @poolqf!

##### New examples:
- Push example for UITabBarController.
- **Carthage** requieres to have an XCode project capable of building a framework: that's what the **Builder** sample project is for. The project also contains basic tests using `XCTest` to be sure it builds and imports the framework properly and delivers basic initializers from `SLKTextViewController` (more test should be added in the future).
- A new Tests project, decoupled from other sample projects to allow dedicated and automated tests. Uses [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta), [FBSnapshotTestCase](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case) and [Expecta+Snapshots](https://github.com/dblock/ios-snapshot-test-case-expecta) amazing OSS frameworks.

- Fixed: By ignoring the status bar height we've fixed the issue of problematic popover presentation.
- Fixed: A bunch of minor quibbles with auto-completion. That docket has been cleared.
- Fixed: Several knotty substring and string appending crashes are now much nicer.
- Fixed: Layout issue when embedding SLKTextViewController inside of a UITabBarController not showing the text input.
- Fixed: Inaccuracy in character counter issues by considering white spaces and dramatic pauses. Or spaces, anyway.
- Fixed: Left/Right cursor change with external keyboard, overriding native cursor shift. Upsi!
- Added: A slk prefix to all private APIs, to avoid unwanted overrides.
- Removed: deprecated APIs.
