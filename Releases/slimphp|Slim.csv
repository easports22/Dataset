2202478,2015-11-29T14:52:43Z,2015-11-29T15:07:40Z,3.0.0 RC 3,"This release fixes a security issue, clears up some inconsistencies and fixes a number of bugs.

## Security fix in 3.0.0-RC3:
- [#1624](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1624) - XXE attacks are now prevented when parsing XML input.

## BC breaks in 3.0.0-RC3:

These are the BC breaks since RC2:
- [#1631](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1631) - The route callable is now bound to the Container rather than to the App to be consistent with middleware binding. This means that if you are using `$this->subRequest` then you now need to `use ($app)` and then `$app->subRequest(…)`. Also if you were using `$this->getContainer()->get(…)`, you need to change this to `$this->get(…)`. Note that using `$this->foo` to retrieve a service from the container continues to work.
- [#1626](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1626) - Route paths are now simply concatentated with no magic. This may affect the way route groups were previously set up, but from now on, it's very predictable.
- [#1625](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1625) - Group middleware is now executed before the route's middleware as you would expect. See issue [#1622](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/1622) for details.

- [#1550](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1550) - The `MiddlewareTrait`'s `addMiddleware()` method is now protected. Please use the `add()` method.
- [#1559](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1559) - `Request::getIp()` has been removed. Please use middleware such as [rka-ip-address-middleware](https://github.com/akrabat/rka-ip-address-middleware) instead.

New features in 3.0.0-RC2:
- [#1509](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1509) - Slim 3's error handlers now only show exception information if you enable the `displayErrorDetails` setting.
- [#1552](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1552) - The router now has a new method called `internalPathFor()` for use with `subRequest()`.
- We have adopted [Glenn Eggleton](https://twitter.com/geggleto)'s' [PHP-View](https://github.com/slimphp/PHP-View) component for rendering using PHP view scripts.

- [#1457](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1457) - The Container can now be configured via an array passed into the `App`'s constructor. Note that this means that your settings must now live in a sub-array called '`settings`'.
- [#1443](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1443) - `pathFor` now prepends the base path, making URLs easier to generate when you are running Slim within a subdirectory and removes the need to prepend with `getBaseUrl()`.

New features in 3.0.0-RC1:
- [#1490](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1490) - Slim 3's error handlers now return JSON, XML or HTML as determined by the request's Accept header.

- #1425 - Slim 3 now requires PHP 5.5 or higher
- #1393, #1369 & #1354 - Various updates to our PSR-7 implementation, including a fix to allow the request body to be read more than once.
- #1345 - New `foundHandler` to change the signature of the route callable. By default the handler is `RequestResponse` which creates callables with a signature of `function($request, $response, $args)`, but we also supply a `RequestResponseArgs` handler with a callable signature of `function($request, $response, $routeParam1, $routeParam2)`.
- #1343 - Ability to set default attributes on a route which can then be accessed within the route callable.
- #1362 - None of the factories in the container need to return a new instance to make it compatible with container-interop.

107807,2013-11-29T20:33:51Z,2013-11-29T20:36:06Z,Version 2.4.0,"## Class controllers

You may now use a controller class instance as a callback for your Slim app routes.

```
$app->get('/hello/:name', '\Greeting:sayHello');
```

In this example, when the app receives a request for ""/hello/Josh"", it will _instantiate_ class `\Greeting` and pass the value ""Josh"" into its `sayHello` method.

Note that we separate the class name and the class method with a single "":"" colon. This is a unique syntax used by Slim to implement this functionality. Do not confuse this with the ""::"" syntax used for static method calls.

## Request parameter defaults

When fetching request data with the `\Slim\Http\Request` object's `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()`, or `delete()` methods, you can define the default value you want if the requested data is not available. For example:

```
$app->get('/books', function () use ($app) {
    $value = $app->request->get('genre', 'fiction');
});
```

In this example, we expect the HTTP request to have a URL query parameter `genre`. If this query parameter does not exist, we will use ""fiction"" as the default value.

## View Template Data

You may now pass data into a view template with `\Slim\View::display()` and `\Slim\View::fetch()`.

```
// Fetch a rendered template into a variable
$renderedTemplate = $app->view->fetch('my-template.php', ['foo' => 'bar']);

// Echo a rendered template to the output buffer
$app->view->display('my-template.php', ['foo' => 'bar']);
```

## Other Changes
- Remove mcrypt dependency
- Add PHP 5.5 to Travis CI tests
- Improve typehinting with popular PHP IDEs
- Ensure application view template directory is defined on view construction
- Add HTTP 418 status code to `\Slim\Http\Response`
