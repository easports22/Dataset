The new `generate_appcast` tool automatically creates and updates appcast.xml files with DSA signatures and binary delta updates from a directory of archives.

```
./bin/generate_appcast path/to/your/private/dsa_key.pem update_downloads_folder/
```

The first argument for the tool is a [DSA private key](https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/publishing/) that must be corresponding to a DSA public key embedded in your app.

The second argument is a folder that should contain archived versions of your app bundle, e.g. `example-app-1.2.zip`, `example-app-1.3.zip`, etc.

The tool will read all information from the archives, e.g. read app versions and appcast URL from `Info.plist` of the archived apps. 

It will generate (or update existing) appcast and create delta update files in the same directory. You can upload/rsync the entire directory to your server.

Note that the tool currently works only with regular `.app` bundles (i.e. not `.pkg` updates) and requires apps to use DSA signatures and have `SUFeedURL` in the Info.plist.

Applications using Sparkle with **HTTPS appcast feed URLs and HTTPS release notes links (if any) are safe**. We strongly recommend everyone to switch to HTTPS ([it's fast](https://istlsfastyet.com/) and [certificates are free](https://letsencrypt.org/)).

Big improvements to code signing and DSA verification:  Sparkle now checks not only whether an update is correctly signed, but also whether the updated version will be able to verify future updates. Updates now must either use DSA keys correctly, or not try to use them at all. Same goes for Apple Code Signing.
- Rely on code signing and the DSA key in the new app instead of appcast. If the new app has a public DSA key, then the appcast item must have a DSA signature for the app, even if the app is code signed. (Zorg)
- More verbose error message when DSA keys don't match (Kornel Lesiński)
- Added delegate methods for pre-download and immediately post-failed-download (Isaac Greenspan)
- Fixed Lucida Grande is always used for release notes (LIU Dongyuan / 柳东原)
- Only remove quarantine with setResourceValue: when it's present. Fixes ""Unable to quarantine: 93"" messages from showing up in the console. (Zorg)
- Fixed const and nullability warnings (Jake Petroules, Kornel Lesiński)
- Replaced deprecated NSRunAlertPanel/alertWithMessageText (Kevin Wojniak)

400724,2008-06-01T05:53:56Z,2014-06-29T04:47:08Z,1.5-beta1,"- The most important things to know:
  - The 10.3 support is untested at best; sketchy at worst. Test with it thoroughly before you use it.
  - Sparkle now asks for permission to update on second launch; don't be surprised at that. You can change that behavior with a delegate method; read SUUpdater.h for more info.
  - We no longer distinguish between ""check on startup"" and ""scheduled updates""; everything is scheduled, with the default being every day.
  - The test application is using the new profiling features, but that's only for demonstration: these are off by default. More on this later.
  - There are no localizations yet.
- New features:
  - Sparkle now supports .pkgs. Just name the .pkg the name of the app and put in the update archive.
  - Sparkle now sends optional demographic profiling information; set SUEnableSystemProfiling to YES in your Info.plist and check out the GET data sent to your webserver when fetching the appcast. More on this in the documentation. The test application has this on so you can see the behavior.
  - Sparkle now supports updating non-.apps. Just call -setHostBundle: on the global SUUpdater to let it know what you're trying to update.
  - Sparkle now supports garbage collection in the host app. Use ""Sparkle-with-GC.framework"" for that, but be aware it's 10.5-only.
  - Sparkle is now 64-bit compatible, compiling both ppc64 and x86_64.
  - Sparkle now supports a sparkle:minimumSystemVersion key you can set on appcast items. It does what you think it does.
  - Sparkle now checks to see if the host app is running from a disk image and refuses to update if it is. (10.4+ only)
  - Added support for entities in enclosure paths.
  - The file size output is now formatted prettily.
  - Sparkle now gives visual indication that it's checking for updates when the update's user initiated. ie: it pops up a status controller saying ""checking for updates...""
  - Added support for an SUPublicDSAKeyFile, so people don't have to copy/paste their entire key into their Info.plist. Set this key in your Info.plist to the filename of the key in your Resources directory.
  - Added an actually maintainable codebase.
- Changes:
  - Sparkle version comparison is now dramatically less stupid and verified by a bunch of unit tests. If something doesn't work the way you think it should, add a test to SUVersionComparisonTest.m
  - Added a minimum to the check interval so that developers don't accidentally release their apps into the wild with 60-second test check intervals and have DOS-attack-like results. It's an hour now for release mode; feel free to change it.
  - The relaunching process now uses a separate helper app, which is a much more robust method.
  - Changed CFBundleShortVersionString behavior: Sparkle no longer uses Apple's about box style of displaying ShortVersionString (CFBundleVersion) when the latter is available.
  - No more MD5 checking. Use DSA: it's actually secure.
  - The abomination that was SUStatusChecker is dead. Use SUProbingUpdateDriver instead.
- Bugfixes:
  - Fixed a huge bug with fully-automatic updating: before, if the user chose to relaunch later, the app would be running from the trash for a while. Now the buttons are ""install and relaunch"" or ""install later.""
  - Sparkle forces Spotlight to reindex the updated app so that it won't keep pointing to the one in the trash.
  - Sparkle trims whitespace from around DSA signatures; this could cause crashes before.
  - Fixed a bug where the user choosing to skip a version would inhibit future automatic updates until the next launch.
  - Fixed a bug that could occur when the app has a localized CFBundleName.
  - .dmgs now work on Leopard.
  - The status controller's button now sizes appropriately to the localization.
  - Sparkle now works correctly with LSUIElement apps: it focuses them before displaying the update alert.
  - Sparkle now deletes failed partial downloads.
  - The update alert no longer floats above everything in the app.
  - Fixed varied and sundry memory leaks.
- A ton of other things that I've forgotten or were too small to mention!

  - Most of the delegate method selectors have changed to scale better. See SUUpdater.h for changes; you'll likely have to make changes if you implement any delegate methods.
  - If you're using .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 archives, name them "".tbz"" or "".tgz"" instead; Sparkle now uses UTIs for archive detection, and it's not  smart about double extensions.
  - I'm no longer supporting 10.3. This may or may not work on Panther—probably not.
  - Sparkle's no longer built for ppc64 by default. If you want to ship that, feel free to build your own, but this saves a few hundred k.
- Enhancements:
  - Sparkle now detects if the preferences for automatic update checks or the time interval change mid-cycle.  
  - If your product is a non-.app, you need to clue Sparkle in on the change by calling [[SUUpdater sharedUpdater] updatePreferencesChanged].
  - Added a cancel to the ""checking for updates..."" dialog.
  - Sparkle now cleans up all its litter in /tmp.
  - Made SUUpdater's delegate an IBOutlet so you can hook it up in IB.
- Bug fixes:
  - Sparkle no longer crashes on non-GC hosts when the user cancels an update's downloads.
  - Sparkle no longer gets stuck in an inconsistent state or crashes when it can't parse the appcast on scheduled updates.
  - Added the sharedUpdater method to SUUpdater, as it should have been.
  - Fixed a bug where the ""checking for updates..."" window wouldn't go away if an error occurs while checking for updates.
  - Made the dual-mode build configuration actually use the .xcconfig which builds it with GC support. (oops!)
  - Fixed relaunching for prefpanes.
  - Sparkle no longer fails to install updates on Snow Leopard (though there's still an issue with trashing the old version of the app, but it seems to be a 10.6 bug)
  - Sparkle now handles redirects correctly under Tiger.
  - Fixed the installation path for non-.app bundles.
  - Fixed a bug which could crash Sparkle under non-English locales.
  - Fixed a weird race condition which could cause the relaunch tool to never notice that its target relaunched.
  - Fixed a bug where if the host app is inactive when an update occurs, the update alert sometimes doesn't become key.
  - Minor textual fixes.

  - French: Yann Ricquebourg
  - Spanish: Ernesto Gomez Cereijo

- Important Changes!
  - Made every Sparkle class private except for SUUpdater, SUAppcast, SUAppcastItem, and the SUVersionComparisonProtocol.
  - There is now a single SUUpdater singleton for every host bundle; instead of -[SUUpdater setHostBundle], you can use +[SUUpdater updaterForBundle].
  - Redefined the (entire) delegate protocol accordingly.
  - Renamed -[SUUpdater updatePreferencesChanged] to -[SUUpdater resetUpdateCycle]. This provides better semantics for non-apps, which need to start the update cycle manually.
  - -[SUUpdater checkForUpdatesWithDriver] is private. If you were using SUProbingUpdateDriver, you can now use -[SUUpdater checkForUpdateInformation] for a similar effect.
  - All the user defaults keys are now private; instead, SUUpdater is KVC-compliant for automaticallyChecksForUpdates, updateCheckInterval, and feedURL.
- Reduced the size of the English-only framework by 25%.
- System profiling information is now only submitted to the server once per week; this will help normalize your statistics across users with different interval preferences.
- The feedParamatersForUpdater: delegate method now requires ""displayKey"" and ""displayVersion"" keys so that it can inform the user what's being sent.
- Added a delegate method called pathToRelaunchForUpdater: which can be used for plugins to provide the path which should be used when relaunching the client after installing an update.
- Added support for xml:lang to pick localized nodes in appcasts (for release notes, etc).
- Fixed a bug which would cause the ""checking for updates"" window to not disappear in certain extraordinary error conditions.
- Fixed a DSA signature checking bug for .tar.gz archives.
- Sparkle now refuses to update on any read-only volume, not just dmgs.
- Sparkle will clean up the host app's name and version before sending it as the user agent string; some non-ASCII characters were causing problems.

### Migration from 10.6

If you need to support users with 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or older, then please use the [old Sparkle 1.5](https://github.com/pornel/Sparkle/releases/tag/sparkle-1.5b6) or compile a 32-bit version of Sparkle [1.6.1](https://github.com/pornel/Sparkle/tree/1.6.1).

Otherwise, if you update apps only on 10.7 or newer, then add the `<sparkle:minimumSystemVersion>10.7</sparkle:minimumSystemVersion>` tag to `<item>`s in your [appcast](https://github.com/pornel/Sparkle/wiki/Publishing-An-Update). This will ensure that apps on 10.6 won't download an update they can't run.
