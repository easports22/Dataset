  - _Changed behavior warning!_ `externalize` now goes out of it's way to ensure it doesn't mutate its input anymore, and returns a copy.

  much much fewer tasks considered to have an upstream status. https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/1789

### At least read these
- Luigi finally has user-land configurable task status messages https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/1625
- Parameters: From now on, you must not pass `None` as the default for a
  parameter. Usually, passing the empty string `''` is a sufficient
  replacement. If you don't do this luigi will print a deprecation warning.
  https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/1624.
- Logging for server: Things are greatly improved
  now as of https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/1633

  - Previous potential harm: Malicious hackers can run arbitrary code if they have file system (even external mounts!)+network access on the machine running luigid (executed by the user that you run luigid with).

We wait for a while with saying how to use this exploit, giving time to people to apply the bugfix.

- External tasks are now also registered. This might cause breakage in settings like described [here](https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/880#issuecomment-94008171)
- Many configuration settings have been hoisted to the new configuration system. Particularly for hdfs-related parameters. The `--help` command will show what new options are available.
- While `is_global` is not removed yet. It'll get removed anytime soon. Please use the new `positional=False` setting as a replacement in your parameters. In fact, we suggest to always use `positional=False`.
- The central scheduler now supports searching within groups. https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/903
- New dependency graph rendering using D3. https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/920
- The built in map reduce framework can now use `ujson` instead of doing `eval`. It's still not clear to us how much faster it is.  https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/939

1.1.0 corresponds to 0abe27e5c6be616e107745b48dff8939815da73c and has been run internally at Spotify for a while so should be fairly robust.

I would have released latest master as 1.1.0 had it not been for the bugs around Tornado (#824). Hoping to launch an 1.1.1 soon.

setup.py has recorded 1.0.24 for a while now, which is not correct for all commits after 0abe27e5c6be616e107745b48dff8939815da73c. I bumped the version of setup.py to 1.1.1
