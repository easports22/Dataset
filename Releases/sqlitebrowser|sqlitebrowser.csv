7825668,2017-09-20T13:59:51Z,2017-09-20T15:25:45Z,DB Browser for SQLite 3.10.1,"This is a minor bug fix release for most people, but does address one fairly important problem with the Windows installer for the previous (3.10.0) release.

That previous release included updated MSVC redistributables which rebooted some people's computers at the end of the install, without warning or even prompting to save files. üò¶ 

Thanks to a fix by @Mischanix, the installer now instructs the included MSVC redistributes **not** to reboot when it finishes.  Problem solved. :smile:

## Highlights

* Further updated translations
* Much improved [dbhub.io](https://db4s-beta.dbhub.io) integration
  * Much easier to use list and upload databases
  * The database licence, public/private setting, and a commit message can be set in the upload dialog
  * Try to avoid uploading files over ~100MB in size for now though, as we're investigating a bug around larger sized DB4S :wink: 
* ... several other minor bug fixes

## Notes
* All builds (both Windows and MacOS X) include SQLCipher for strong encryption.
* The version of SQLCipher included is a bit old.  We're waiting for the next official SQLCipher release so it can be included.

  * There's a 100MB per database limit at the moment though, as it's still in development :wink:
  * Backups aren't done on it (yet), so don't use it as your only place for storing important things (!!!)
  * The front page is... not great.  We're working on it. üëº 
  * Still lots of upcoming stuff needing to be done.  An API to query your databases, a cli, merging, discussions/issues
  * Please [report bugs](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/dbhub.io/issues), ideas, suggestions (etc) on [the dbhub.io repo issue tracker](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/dbhub.io/issues) as you find them.

The first beta for our 3.9.0 release series!
- All builds (both Windows and MacOS X) include SQLCipher for strong encryption.
- 100% complete translations for Arabic, Spanish, and Russian languages
  - Program language can be manually changed in the Preferences dialog, if it's not auto-detecting on startup

On MacOS X, this is our first release using Qt5, and it's worth noting we updated the underlying SQLite to version 3.9.2 (on both platforms) this is so we can support the changes made for 3.9.x which impact database schema, see https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_9_2.html for these changes.

You will also notice a lot of ""user experience"" enhancements and fixes, so hopefully you will find this new release a pleasure to use. :smile:

## Translations
- Add translation into Traditional Chinese - #425 (thanks to @PeterDaveHello)

## Cross platform fixes
- Fix building on OS X 10.10 - #384 (thanks to @jehoffmann)

## Notes for the MacOS X binaries
- The OSX binaries were built on an OSX 10.9.5 system, and should be backwards compatible with OSX 10.7 and above (that's the theory anyway... :wink:)
- OS X 10.6 is no longer supported - DB4S always crashes on it, and we haven't been able to figure out why.  OSX 10.7 and above work well though.  If someone wants to investigate this in depth and get OSX 10.6 working again, that would be useful :grin:
- The normal release on OSX (without SQLCipher support), bundles SQLite 3.9.2
- The SQLCipher supporting release on OSX bundles SQLCipher 3.3.1 (based on SQLite 3.8.10.2).  If you need features from the new SQLite 3.9.x series, you'll have to do without SQLCipher support for now

One of the major improvements in this release, is support for encrypted databases (for MacOS X and Linux only, not Windows yet).  This is done using the [SQLCipher](http://sqlcipher.net) encryption library.

In this release, our CSV file import and export code has been extensively
modified for better RFC compatibility.  The CSV code has also been changed
to use a streaming approach (thanks Rene!) instead of loading everything
into memory first.  This allows the import and export of large data sets, which
previously crashed the application when it ran out of memory.

Another important feature in this release is support for custom collation
sequences.  This lets people use SQLite3 databases copied from their Android
phone or tablet.  Previously, the database would load, but every operation
would error out with ""No such collation sequence: LOCALIZED"".  Should be
useful. :wink:

Naturally this release has several other bug fixes and usability tweaks, plus
the bundled version of SQLite has been updated to the latest (v3.8.7).

413334,2014-07-06T08:19:56Z,2014-07-06T21:40:45Z,SQLite Database Browser 3.2.0,"This version is a recommended upgrade from all previous releases.  It has a large number of improvements and bug fixes. :smile:

Of special note is the new **Project files** feature, for saving metadata about your SQLite Database files.  Now when you change the onscreen size of columns or the sort order in the browse data tab, enter code in the SQL tab or the like, the new settings are kept between sessions. You don't need to restore them manually every time you load the database file. Just open the project file instead of the database file.

## Improvements
- Add keyboard shortcuts for saving changes and for executing a SQL statement https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/22 https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/2136813bd6c8ae23167be6c27e2bd28c64ad2023 https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/commit/682561fbb94b4f8149a47e363d3792771d80e9bb
- Add High DPI text rendering support for Mac OSX https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/pull/21
- Remember column widths on Browse Data tab? https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/20
- Allow any character as field separator and quote character when importing/exporting CSV files https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/14 https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/23
- Added entries for the Help menu https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/13
- Also show temporary tables and views in the UI
- Browse Data Tab: Remember column widths of the current table when changing to another
- Initial code to allow translations of the UI into other languages (work in progress)
- Fixes for building with Qt 5

### Windows only
