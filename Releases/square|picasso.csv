- Fix: Only use the built-in disk cache on API 14+ (but you're all using [OkHttp][1] anyways,
  right?).

36067,2013-08-30T21:47:57Z,2013-08-30T23:26:33Z,2.0.0,"- New architecture distances Picasso further from the main thread using a dedicated dispatcher
  thread to manage requests.
- Request merging. Two requests on the same key will be combined and the result will be delivered
  to both at the same time.
- `fetch()` requests are now properly wired up to be used as ""warm up the cache"" type of requests
  without a target.
- `fit()` will now automatically wait for the view to be measured before executing the request.
- `shutdown()` API added. Clears the memory cache and stops all threads. Submitting new requests
  will cause a crash after `shutdown()` has been called.
- Batch completed requests to the main thread to reduce main thread re-layout/draw calls.
- Variable thread count depending on network connectivity. The faster the network the more threads
  and vice versa.
- Ability to specify a callback with `ImageView` requests.
- Picasso will now decode the bounds of the target bitmap over the network. This helps avoid
  decoding 2000x2000 images meant for 100x100 views.
- Support loading asset URIs in the form `file:///android_asset/...`.
- BETA: Ability to rewrite requests on the fly. This is useful if you want to add custom logic for
  wiring up requests differently.
