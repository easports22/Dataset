2375826,2016-01-05T17:24:00Z,2016-01-05T17:27:14Z,2.0.0-beta3,"- New: All classes have been migrated to the `retrofit2.*` package name. The Maven groupId is now
  `com.squareup.retrofit2`. This is in accordance with the
  [Java Interoperability Policy for Major Version Updates](http://jakewharton.com/java-interoperability-policy-for-major-version-updates/).
  With this change Retrofit 2.x can coexiest with Retrofit 1.x in the same project.
- New: Update to use the OkHttp 3 API and OkHttp 3.0.0-RC1 or newer is now required. Similar to the previous
  point, OkHttp has a new package name (`okhttp3.*`) and Maven groupId (`com.squareup.okhttp3`) which allow
  it to coexist with OkHttp 2.x in the same project.
- New: String converters allow for custom serialization of parameters that end up as strings (such as `@Path`,
  `@Query`, `@Header`, etc.). `Converter.Factory` has a new `stringConverter` method which receives the
  parameter type and annotations and can return a converter for that type. This allows providing custom
  rendering of types like `Date`, `User`, etc. to a string before being used for its purpose. A default
  converter will call `toString()` for any type which retains the mimics the previous behavior.
- New: OkHttp's `Call.Factory` type is now used as the HTTP client rather than using the `OkHttpClient` type
  directly (`OkHttpClient` does implement `Call.Factory`). A `callFactory` method has been added to both
  `Retrofit.Builder` and `Retrofit` to allow supplying alternate implementations of an HTTP client. The
  `client(OkHttpClient)` method on `Retrofit.Builder` still exists as a convenience.
- New: `isExecuted()` method returns whether a `Call` has been synchronously or asynchronously executed.
- New: `isCanceled()` method returns whether a `Call` has been canceled. Use this in `onFailure` to determine
  whether the callback was invoked from cancelation or actual transport failure.
- New: `converter-scalars` module provides a `Converter.Factory` for converting `String`, the 8 primitive
  types, and the 8 boxed primitive types as `text/plain` bodies. Install this before your normal converter
  to avoid passing these simple scalars through, for example, a JSON converter.
- New: `Converter.Factory` methods now receive a `Retrofit` instance which also now has methods for querying
  the next converter for a given type. This allows implementations to delegate to others and provide
  additional behavior without complete reimplementation.
- New: `@OPTIONS` annotation more easily allows for making OPTIONS requests.
- New: `@Part` annotation now supports `List` and array types.
- New: The `@Url` annotation now allows using `java.net.URI` or `android.net.Uri` (in addition to `String`)
  as parameter types for providing relative or absolute endpoint URLs dynamically.
- New: The `retrofit-mock` module has been rewritten with a new `BehaviorDelegate` class for implementing
  fake network behavior in a local mock implementation of your service endpoints. Documentation and more
  tests are forthcoming, but the `SimpleMockService` demonstrates its use for now.
- Fix: Forbid Retrofit's `Response` type and OkHttp's `Response` type as the response body type given to
  a `Call` (i.e., `Call<Response>`). OkHttp's `ResponseBody` type is the correct one to use when the raw
  body contents are desired.
- Fix: The Gson converter now respects settings on the supplied `Gson` instance (such as `serializeNulls`).
  This requires Gson 2.4 or newer.
- The Wire converter has been updated to the Wire 2.0 API.
- The change in 2.0.0-beta2 which provided the `Retrofit` instance to the `onResponse` callback of `Callback`
  has been reverted. There are too many edge cases around providing the `Retrofit` object in order to allow
  deserialization of the error body. To accommodate this use case, pass around the `Retrofit` response
  manually or implement a custom `CallAdapter.Factory` does so automatically.

1877744,2015-09-28T15:15:31Z,2015-09-28T15:22:20Z,2.0.0-beta2,"- New: Using a response type of `Void` (e.g., `Call<Void>`) will ignore and discard the response body. This
  can be used when there will be no response body (such as in a 201 response) or whenever the body is not
  needed. `@Head` requests are now forced to use this as their response type.
- New: `validateEagerly()` method on `Retrofit.Builder` will verify the correctness of all service methods
  on calls to `create()` instead of lazily validating on first use.
- New: `Converter` is now parameterized over both 'from' and 'to' types with a single `convert` method.
  `Converter.Factory` is now an abstract class and has factory methods for both request body and response
  body.
- New: `Converter.Factory` and `CallAdapter.Factory` now receive the method annotations when being created
  for a return/response type and the parameter annotations when being created for a parameter type.
- New: `callAdapter()` method on `Retrofit` allows querying a `CallAdapter` for a given type. The
  `nextCallAdapter()` method allows delegating to another `CallAdapter` from within a `CallAdapter.Factory`.
  This is useful for composing call adapters to incrementally build up behavior.
- New: `requestConverter()` and `responseConverter()` methods on `Retrofit` allow querying a `Converter` for
  a given type.
- New: `onResponse` method in `Callback` now receives the `Retrofit` instance. Combined with the
  `responseConverter()` method on `Retrofit`, this provides a way of deserializing an error body on `Response`.
  See the `DeserializeErrorBody` sample for an example.
- New: The `MoshiConverterFactory` has been updated for its v1.0.0.
- Fix: Using `ResponseBody` for the response type or `RequestBody` for a parameter type is now correctly
  identified. Previously these types would erroneously be passed to the supplied converter.
- Fix: The encoding of `@Path` values has been corrected to conform to OkHttp's `HttpUrl`.
- Fix: Use form-data content disposition subtype for `@Multipart`.
- Fix: `Observable` and `Single`-based execution of requests now behave synchronously (and thus requires
  `subscribeOn()` for running in the background).
- Fix: Correct `GsonConverterFactory` to honor the configuration of the `Gson` instances (such as not
  serializing null values, the default).

- When using OkHttp, version 1.6.0 or newer (including 2.0.0+) is now required.
- The absence of a response body and an empty body are now differentiated in the log messages.
