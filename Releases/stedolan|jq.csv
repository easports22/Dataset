The manual for jq 1.5 can be found at https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/v1.5/

Salient new features since 1.4:
- regexp support (using Oniguruma)!
- a proper module system
  
  `import ""foo/bar"" as bar; # import foo/bar.jq's defs into a bar::* namespace`
  
  and
  
  `include ""foo/bar""; # import foo/bar.jq's defs into the top-level`
- destructuring syntax (`. as [$first, $second, {$foo, $bar}] | ...`)
- math functions
- an online streaming parser
- minimal I/O builtions (`inputs`, `debug`)
  
  One can now write:
  
  `jq -n 'reduce inputs as $i ( ... )'`
  
  to reduce inputs in an online way without having to slurp them first!  This works with streaming too.
- try/catch, for catching and handling errors (this makes for a dynamic non-local exit system)
- a lexical non-local exit system
  
  One can now say
  
  `label $foo | ..... | break $foo`
  
  where the break causes control to return to the label $foo, which
  then produces `empty` (backtracks).  There's named and anonymous
  labels.
- tail call optimization (TCO), which allows efficient recursion in jq
- a variety of new control structure builtins (e.g., `while(cond; exp)`, `repeat(exp)`, `until(cond; next)`), many of which internally use TCO
- an enhanced form of `reduce`: `foreach exp as $name (init_exp; update_exp; extract_exp)`
- the ability to read module data files
  
  `import ""foo/bar"" as $bar; # read foo/bar.json, bind to $bar::bar`
- `--argjson var '<JSON text>'`
  
  Using --arg var <number> bit me too many times :)
- `--slurpfile var ""filename""`
  
  Replaces the `--argfile` form (which is now deprecated but remains for backward compatibility).
- support for application/json-seq (RFC7464)
- a large variety of new utility functions, many being community contributions (e.g., `bsearch`, for binary searching arrays)
- datetime functions
- a variety of performance enhancements
- `def($a): ...;` is now allowed as an equivalent of `def(a): a as $a | ...;`
- test and build improvements, including gcov support

- regexp support (using Oniguruma)
- an online streaming parser
  
  Included is the ability to control reading of inputs from the jq
  program, using the new `input` and `inputs` builtins.
  
  Finally we can write:
  
  jq -n 'reduce inputs as $i ( ... )' # reduce online!
  
  to reduce inputs without slurping them first.  This works with
  streaming too.
- try/catch, for catching and handling errors (this makes for a dynamic non-local exit system)
- a lexical non-local exit system
  
  Using try/catch to break out of control structures was not a good
  thing.  A lexical mechanism is.
  
  You can now say

  where the break causes control to return to the label $foo, which
  then produces `empty` (backtracks).  There's named and anonymous
