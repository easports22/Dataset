All our documentation is available on our website, as always: https://www.styled-components.com

## Changed

### Added support for webpack nonces

Albeit not the final work on this, we added some initial support webpack nonces. https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1022

### Added an alias for React Native's ImageBackground component

We added the missing alias for the new `ImageBackground` component in React Native. Go try it out! https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1028

### Snapshot testing

We switched more of our tests over to snapshot testing! We hope that this will greatly improve our development speed when implementing new features that only slightly affect our CSS fixtures in our tests.

Be tuned for more!

## Fixed

### Deterministic ID generation

We previously had no plans for fixing the deterministic ID generation for our new v2 APIs until the new v3 code changes. But since the babel-plugin and SSR have become more important for a huge amount of our users, we now have a fix ready that should support these two methods.

`.extend` and `.withComponent` now create new component IDs during the runtime, which are still deterministic. While they're not created during compile time, this is a step towards our good SSR support, which is very important to us.

### Misc.

- Refactor variable in generateAlphabeticName.js
- Fix `.extend` not working after chaining it repeatedly (3 or more inheritances)
- Fix Flow type signatures for compatibility with Flow v0.47.0

Before stylis would share middleware and options for everyone who's using it. In `v3.2` it was fixed so that an instance of stylis can be created that is isolated from the global singleton and other instances. This previously wasn't possible and broke compatbility with styled-jsx, since it's also using stylis.

## Fixed

- Remove dependencies from ES bundle. Now all dependencies are imported, not bundled, when using the ES-style import bundle.
- Upgrade to stylis v3.2 and use constructor

As presented in [this excellent talk from React Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNwQPJy-XZY&list=PLCC436JpVnK3KpieWtxYN6aC2-exR_IxH&index=7) [react-primitives](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-primitives) is a project that attempts to generalise the React Native API to be platform-agnostic. Adding a `styled-components/primitives` entry point allows us to start experimenting with what styled-components can add in that equation, in particular, [react-sketchapp](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp).

### Updated TypeScript typings for v2

It's not secret that v2 was released without updated typings, so we're sure that unfortunately some of you had to wait a little longer.

This release updates the typings with all new APIs and features:

- ServerStyleSheet API
- extend method
- withComponent
- attrs
- function themes
- styled components as interpolations

We hope that everything is now working as expected with TypeScript.

### Upgrade to Stylis v3

Apart from fixing a couple of missing prefixes here and there, Stylis now tries to add missing semicolons. We've gotten some reports and issues in the past of some components breaking an app, when a semicolon was missing, so this should be a nice addition!

The CSS output should also be slightly more minified.

## Fixed

- Remove dead code used previously for auto-prefixing (& inline-style-prefixer)
- Fix `.extend` not working after chaining it repeatedly (3 or more inheritances)
- Fix Flow type signatures for compatibility with Flow v0.47.0

Read the full changelog in prose over here on Medium: https://medium.com/styled-components/announcing-v2-f01ef3766ac2

It's been a long time (*ehem*, forever) that we've written release notes, so let's start with a detailed one for v2.

All our documentation is now hosted on a nice website, so if you're having trouble with v2, or learning styled-components in general, check our website: https://www.styled-components.com

## Breaking Changes

### PostCSS was replaced with Stylis

Instead of PostCSS we're now using Stylis for our CSS processing needs. By doing so we managed to cut our bundle size (min+gzip) from ~24kB down to ~12kB, meaning you’ll now ship a lot less code to your users!

### Server Side Rendering

We added an API for concurrent server side rendering including rehydration on the client. The API is lean and simple:

```js
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components'

const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet()
const html = renderToString(sheet.collectStyles(<YourApp />))
const css = sheet.getStyleTags()
```

Learn more in our docs: https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#server-side-rendering

### Upgrade `css-to-react-native` (React Native)

You'll now need to add units to your React Native shorthand styles, but on the up-side: We now support percentage-units!

A codemod is available: https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components-native-code-mod

## Added

### `.attrs`

You can now attach some props directly to a Styled Component. When you use functions as attributes, we'll pass in the component's props, so you can write some more complex logic, without resorting to wrapping an entire component.

```js
const ExternalLink = styled.a.attrs({
  target: '_blank',
  rel: 'nofollow',
  style: props => ({
    background: `${props.hue}, 
                 ${50 + props.luminosity / 2},
                 ${props.luminosity}`
  })
}) // ...
```

### `.extend` and `.withComponent` helpers

The `.extend` method allows you to create a new Styled Component based on another one, combining the rules into a single new class.

```js
const Heading = styled.h1`
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin: 2rem;
  text-align: center;
`
const MarketingHeading = Heading.extend`
  background: midnightblue;
  color: white;
  &:hover { text-shadow: 0 0 4px white; }
`
```

The `.withComponent` method can be used to create a new Styled Component based on another one, but with a different tag or wrapped component.

Chain both methods for unlimited POWER!...

### Contextual Overrides

You can now use Styled Components as interpolations and we'll swap them out for their classnames:

```js
const Link = styled.a`
  color: inherit;
  text-decoration: none;
  &:hover, &:active {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
`
const P = styled.p`
  ${ Link } {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
`
```

## Changed

- Fix defaultProps used instead of ThemeProvider on first render
- Prevent leakage of the `innerRef` prop to wrapped child; under the hood it is converted into a normal React `ref`
- Add hoisting static (non-React) properties for withTheme HOC
- Add `innerRef` support to withTheme HOC
- Fix Theme context for StyledComponent for IE <10
- Fix `setNativeProps` in StyledNativeComponent
- Fix `ref` being passed to Stateless Functional Components in StyledNativeComponent
