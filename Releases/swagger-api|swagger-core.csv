1.5.8 introduced a change of behavior to the resource scanning which ended up reading unintended resources. This change was reverted to the way it was before, only with a cleaner scanning of sub resources. The table below describes what will be scanned and what will be skipped:

| Annotations | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `@Api` | skip |
| `@Path` | skip |
| scanAllResources | skip |
| `@Api` (hidden=true) | skip |
| `@Api` (hidden=true) `@Path` | skip |
| `@Api` (hidden=true) scanAllResources | skip |
| `@Api` scanAllResources | skip |
| `@Api` `@Path` | parse |
| `@Path` scanAllResources | parse |
| subresource | parse |
| `@Api` subresource | parse |

The [wiki](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X) has been updated with the details.

### Notable changes
-  #1756 - Added support for Java 8's java.time.Instant
-  #1715 - Consider java.time.ZonedDateTime a Swagger DateTime primitive

### Notable bug fixes
- #1717 - Fix NPE with class level api response with no ApiOperation annotation in method or no defined responses in operation
- #1506 - JAXRS reads also parent @Api, @ApiImplicitParam and method param annotations

- behavior changes to comma separated “produces” and “consumes” values in `@ApiOperation`, `@Api`, `@Produces` and `@Consumes` annotations; previously these values would be treated as single consume/produce e.g.

``` java
@Produces(“text/xml,text/html”)
```

in previous version would result in:

``` json
""consumes"": [
   ""text/xml,text/html""
  ]
```

With current behavior it will generate:

``` json
""consumes"": [
    ""text/xml"",
    ""text/html""
  ],
```
- **(BREAKING CHANGE)** `/swagger` and `/swagger.{type:json|yaml}` JAX-RS endpoints provided by two separate resources, and 

`io.swagger.jaxrs.listing.ApiListingResource` provides only `/swagger.{type:json|yaml}` endpoint and no longer both `/swagger` (with Accept header `application/json` or `application/yaml`) and `/swagger.{type:json|yaml}`

`/swagger` endpoint is provided by `io.swagger.jaxrs.listing.AcceptHeaderApiListingResource`

If package scanning for providers is used, behavior remains the same (`AcceptHeaderApiListingResource` is in the same package and gets scanned), otherwise `AcceptHeaderApiListingResource` must be added to scanned classes.

see also [wiki](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/1.3--1.5-Migration#jax-rs-providers)
- **(BREAKING CHANGE)** Jersey2 `io.swagger.jersey.listing.ApiListingResourceJSON` no longer provides `/swagger.{type:json|yaml}` endpoint

Related to JAX-RS endpoints change above, 
usage of Jersey2 `io.swagger.jersey.listing.ApiListingResourceJSON` should be replaced by

`io.swagger.jaxrs.listing.ApiListingResource` (or package scanning `io.swagger.jaxrs.listing`);

`ApiListingResourceJSON` no longer provides `/swagger` and `/swagger.{type:json|yaml}`; it provides only  `/` endpoint.

### Upgrade notes:
- Previously, a [JacksonJsonProvider](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/blob/v1.5.6/modules/swagger-jaxrs/src/main/java/io/swagger/jaxrs/json/JacksonJsonProvider.java) class was bundled in the `swagger-jaxrs` module.  This made configuration of the JSON mapper easy and consistent with what is provided for rendering the swagger json/yaml definitions.  Because some deployments need a different mapper configuration, this was causing problems and was removed.  If you were relying on the `JacksonJsonProvider` in the `io.swagger.jaxrs.json` package, please either copy the logic of this file from the [1.5.6 tag](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/tree/v1.5.6) or create your own provider!
- Scanning subresources was inconsistent and didn't always follow the expected patter for `@Api` and `@Path` parameters.  The commit https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/commit/8921f2f566aa8a1fd3917610fd3c0802017bed2a fixes this, but may create issues for those taking advantage of those ""bugs"".

All release provide official initial support for Swagger 2.0’s main features. The missing features will be added in the next milestone releases until the final release is available.

In order to better improve these libraries and tools, we ask that you start using them and provide us with feedback in form of issues on the github repository. The issues are a huge help in finding what’s missing or not working properly (though note some issues are already submitted). We would also appreciate any PRs that improve existing or new tickets.

These releases could not have happened without the intensive support of the Swagger community. Each of the projects had a few PRs that really helped us push these projects forward!

Be aware that the release notes contain the notable changes, but there may some changes that we missed in the list.

Notable Features:
- First official milestone release of Swagger 2.0 support. Swagger-Core now produces Swagger 2.0 specs only.
- (Software) API compatible with 1.3.6+.  For supported configurations, only a dependency upgrade is required. You may need a slight alteration to your configuration.
- Swagger-core is pure Java. Only the tests are in Scala, and those do not affect the dependencies of the library.
- Model introspection is now done by Jackson, and is much more robust.
- No more reliance on com.sun.\* packages, making swagger-core safe for Google App Engine deployments.
- New, extension model for processing different annotation types.  Extensions are loaded via Java SPI, see [here for an example](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/blob/develop_2.0/modules/swagger-jaxrs/src/main/java/com/wordnik/swagger/jaxrs/ext/SwaggerExtension.java)
- Available on Maven central, and the sources are in the 1.5.0-M1 branch. PRs should be submitted against the develop_2.0 branch.
- Please note that the swagger-core-1.5.x-M1 code lives in the 1.5.0-M1 branch.

Limitations:
- There will be a M2 and M3 release of swagger-core which will provide updated support for Play! framework and scala-based servers.  Please see the [github milestones page](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/milestones) for details
- Subresource support is not implemented
- Model converters have a new, incompatible signature with 1.3.x.  Please see [here for an example](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/blob/develop_2.0/modules/swagger-core/src/main/java/com/wordnik/swagger/converter/ModelConverter.java) for details of the new interface
