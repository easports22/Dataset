7182793,2017-07-26T23:20:33Z,2017-07-26T23:21:47Z,0.14.0,"This release contains [72 changes from 12 contributors](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/compare/0.13...0.14). New features include support for tray icons and support for KDE's Wayland extension for client-side border negotiation. Several smaller features and many bug fixes are also included. Updates to wlc also improve touchscreen support and fix the old extra cursor gdm issue.

Tray icons are now supported via SNI, and Xembed support is in-progress and planned for a future release. Tray icons for programs using the new specification should work correctly, but older programs using Xembed will not. Border negotiation requries participation from the client - a patch for GTK+ is available [here](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781909).

You may have heard that we're replacing wlc, a library that does a lot of low-level plumbing work for Sway. I'm happy to announce that our replacement project, [wlroots](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/wlroots), is progressing at a great pace - largely thanks to financial support from [Nyantec](https://nyantec.com/), who offered to sponsor me to work full time on Sway for 3 weeks during this release cycle. Additional support has come from supporters of my new [Patreon page](https://patreon.com/sircmpwn) - many thanks! Dramatic improvements to Sway will be possible when wlroots is ready. Look forward to it!

New features include support for i3's marks feature, ""immediate"" criteria commands, and experimental support for the nvidia proprietary driver. Many small improvements to i3 compatibility and many bugfixes are also included.

For nvidia users, nouveau is still **strongly** recommended. The proprietary driver mostly works, but is **unsupported** - do not report bugs unless you attach a patch. Unless your hardware is unsupported by nouveau, you should continue using nouveau. Using sway with the proprietary drivers requires additional configuration - sway will output the necessary information if you attempt it without a correct configuration.

Package maintainers: please update your packages to use `-DVERSION=major.minor.patch`. Normally the version is sourced from git, but if you build from a tarball then you'll have to specify it manually.

Changes in this release include redshift support (currently requires a patched redshift), new automatic layout modes for Awesome migrants, security improvements, and many bugfixes. Please take careful note of the changes to IPC security configuration - these are backwards-incompatible and will require user intervention if you have customized your security configuration.

Package maintainers - `/etc/sway/security` has been moved to `/etc/sway/security.d/00-defaults`, and users are no longer expected to edit this file. FreeBSD users should take special note of these changes and will likely want to introduce a new file in `/etc/sway/security.d/` that applies a liberal security policy for IPC-related features - the FreeBSD port is unable to enforce per-application IPC rules and you'll want to add a default rule that permits everything for now.

For those hoping to configure sway's default keybindings and behavior to be more like Awesome, see [awesome.config](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/blob/master/contrib/awesome.config)

# Changes

* `/etc/sway/security` has been moved to `/etc/sway/security.d/00-defaults` and users are now encouraged to add their own security configurations as additional files in `/etc/sway/security.d/`. Maintainers of software that integrates with sway and require special permissions are encouraged to ship security configs in this directory as well (@SirCmpwn - #1080)
* If not specified at build time, LD_LIBRARY_PATH will be unset, rather than defaulting to /usr/lib (@Hummer12007 - #1050)
* Default backgrounds have been losslessly re-compressed and should reduce the package weight if enabled (@Jesin - #1032)
* Previously undocumented features (swaygrab -f and hide_edge_borders) are now covered by their respective manuals (@Hummer12007, @ametisf - #1073, #1051)
* Environment logging now occurs prior to compositor initialization, which helps diagnose certain kinds of problems (@SirCmpwn - 41f7aaa)

# New Features

* New automatic layouts unique to sway have been implemented that behave like similar features in WMs like Awesome. See sway(5) and look for `layout auto` for details. (@willakat - #1024)
* Sway now supports gamma adjustment, which you can take advantage of with a [patched redshift](https://github.com/giucam/redshift) (@SirCmpwn - #1019)

The biggest feature 0.11 offers is the first steps towards the goal of a secure Wayland desktop by adding new knobs to secure your sway installation - read sway-security(7) for details. These are only the first steps towards a secure sway, and no promises are made about how well it works. Please test it and look for ways to break it and provide feedback on your experiences.

Package maintainers - consider reading through sway-security(7) and seeing if there are any security-related configuration changes you'd like to ship with your sway installation. SYS_CAP_PTRACE is now required on /usr/bin/sway. Sway also hardcodes LD_LIBRARY_PATH on startup  now - you can change this with `-DLD_LIBRARY_PATH=...` if you set this to something other than /usr/lib in your distro.

FreeBSD users - note that we cannot enforce security policies on a per-executable basis until [this issue](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=215202) is resolved. The default security policy will be applied to all executables.

Also note that today I'm happy to introduce the sway bounty program - contribute some cash to support the development of the features you want, or write the code and claim the bounty! Information about this is available here: https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/issues/986
