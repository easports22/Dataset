* #4446: KCP connections are improved.
* #4451: Folder health checking is improved.
* #4453: STUN mappings are more stable.

This release also includes built in support for file system notifications,

advanced folder config `fsWatcherEnabled`.

Additionally, the UDP based ""KCP"" protocol is now enabled by default. This
provides better connectivity through NAT devices. TCP is the preferred

Note that the last issue is a security vulnerability. Symlinks on Windows are not supported and have not been created by Syncthing for a while. Nonetheless, if you use symlinks on Windows and Syncthing versioning you may have symlinks in your versioning directory from earlier versions. You must remove these manually. Syncthing can not remove them automatically because there are other things that look to us like symlinks but are not - deduplicated files, primarily.

Two distinct security vulnerabilities have been corrected in this release. Either would let a remote attacker, controlling a device that is already accepted by Syncthing, perform arbitrary reads and writes to files outside the configured folders.

The first issue is that path validation was lacking in several places, resulting in Syncthing accepting index entries for files like ""../../foo"", thus resulting in a path above the configured folder.

The second issue is that where path validation was correct, symlinks could be used to trick Syncthing. An attacker could create a symlink ""foo -> ../../"" and then request the contents of ""foo/something"", again escaping the constraints of the folder.

**Syncing symlinks between v0.14.14 and previous versions will not work.**

This is due to the fix to the above issue. Normal files and directories will sync fine. To continue syncing symlinks, both sides must be upgraded to v0.14.14.

## Upgrade Notes
- **v0.13 is not protocol compatible with v0.12.**
- The database format has changed. It will be migrated without rescan on first startup, but the first startup may take longer than usual.

## Major Changes Since v0.12

Devices now announce files that are in progress of being downloaded, in addition to those that are already complete. This means a device can serve parts of a file to other devices before it has completed the download itself.

Folder labels are now distinct from the folder ID. The intention is for the label to be human readable and for the ID to be machine readable and unique. When upgrading, folder IDs are not changed. However when creating new folders Syncthing will suggest a random, unique folder ID.

When receiving a connection attempt from an unknown device Syncthing will now show the name of that device, not only it's ID.

Syncthing will now manage port mappings on NAT-PMP compliant routers, in addition to the existing UPnP support.

## Minor Changes and Improvements
- Ignored files can now be tagged with the prefix (?d) to indicate that Syncthing may delete these files if they remain when deleting a directory. Ignore patterns use less memory by default.
- The address for sync connections, both the listening side and for remote devices, can now be made IPv4- or IPv6-only. Use the tcp4:// or tcp6:// schemes to specify one or the other. The default tcp:// is still dual stack. Additionally, relays are now treated as listen addresses and set in the same configuration setting.
- The folder settings dialog has been cleaned up.
- The environment variable ALL_PROXY_NO_FALLBACK can be set to disable falling back to direct connections in the absence of a working proxy.
- Many, many bug fixes.

## Known Issues
- The ""Syncing"" complete percentage for remote devices may erroneously display more than 100% (i.e. 156% or 297%) while a remote device is still synchronizing.
