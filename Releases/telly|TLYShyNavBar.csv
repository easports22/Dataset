- Finally supporting translucent and **opaque** bars, using a sane code approach.
- Greatly simplify the code to make it more predictable and maintainable for the future.

## Note
- Please note a lot of the code was rewritten, so I apologize in advance of any regression.
- **IMPORTANT** If you have a `UITableViewController` setup, either replace it with a `UIViewController` and a `UITableView` subview, as highlighted in the readme, or don't upgrade since it will break

- New approach to calculate extension and navigation bar offsets.<br />
  Initially, we externally injected the calculation through blocks. The calculations depended on layout guide, and other weird stuff. The new approach simply calculates the offset based on the parent: status bar -> navigation bar -> extension view.
- Added support for sticky navigation bar
