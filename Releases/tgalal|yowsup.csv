1775568,2015-09-06T22:31:53Z,2015-09-06T22:48:06Z,v2.4,"Mostly core updates, and most importantly is the ability for a layer to expose an Interface for direct interaction from other layers/places. For example, doing a yowNetworkLayerInterface.connect() makes more sense than broadcasting an event across all other irrelevant layers. Or a storage layer that saves incoming and outgoing messages, and then a GUI which would like to query a conversation history would request the storage layer's interface which should expose methods like ""getMessages""

# Changes:

## Protocol
- Support sending receipt for multiple messages
- Updated S40 env to 2.12.96

## Core
- Layers can now expose an InterfaceLayer for outside interaction
- YowNetworkLayer and Auth Layer now expose an InterfaceLayer

- Allow setting props on stackbuilder, it passed them to the instantiated stack
- Fixed interface not forwarding to upper layers unhandled protocolenties
- Don't crash on UntrustedIdentityException, will silently ignore the message
- Handle DuplicateMessageException
- Added stack.send/receive
