5035744,2016-12-29T22:12:45Z,2016-12-29T22:29:17Z,Ability to Customize Admin Icon and Loader. Fixes to the Relationship Functionality,"**Customize Admin Icon & Loader**
Admin can now customize the Helm Loader icon and they can also change the loader. Inside of the settings you will now have 2 more settings which are the `admin_loader` and `admin_icon_image`. If you do not have that setting you can create a new setting with `admin_loader` and `admin_icon_image` as the key and setting the type to `image`.

You can try out the following 2 images. Here is another loader image:
![example-loader](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/601261/21556060/86f2256a-cdd2-11e6-8548-d0da26a35c55.png)

And here is a white icon (you may not be able to see it, but you can right-click and download it)
![example-admin-icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/601261/21556077/9c165dbc-cdd2-11e6-96a1-a87e33aca239.png)

**Relationship Fixes**

Now, when you add a dropdown and specify a relationship, you can also add a few more options to the dropdown, like so:

```
{
    ""relationship"": {
        ""key"": ""id"",
        ""label"": ""name""
    },
    ""default"" : ""option1"",
    ""options"" : {
        ""option1"": ""Option 1 Text"",
        ""option2"": ""Option 2 Text""
    }
}
```

This is similar to how you would have done a normal dropdown. Above the `option1` and `option2` will now be values in the dropdown along with the relationship.

Also, if you were to add more than one many-to-many multi-select to any BREAD DataType, it would only sync the data for one of those multi-selects. This is now fixed and will allow you to use as many multi-selects as you would like inside of your BREAD Data Types.

```

Cause now `VoyagerServiceProvider` register this provider within.

However if you do already have added the service provider to you configuration, you may remove it but are not forced to, since Laravel ensures that a provider is only added once.
