This was done to fix #71 as well as make life easier for people who want to make items and collections use some different logic. For example, `JsonApiSerializer` wants even a single item to appear inside an array, meaning we can wrap the data in the item() serializer method to do that, but keep it as an item in case anyone wants to switch to a different serializer.

See [Serializers](http://fractal.thephpleague.com/serializers/) documentation for more information.
