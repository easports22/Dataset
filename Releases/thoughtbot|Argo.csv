- Added parsing from String for decoding Int64 - [Niels van Hoorn](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo/pull/301)

## Non-Breaking Changes
- Update errors for RawRepresentable types. - [Paul Young](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo/pull/277)
- Remove `CustomStringConvertible` constraint on `typeMismatch` function - [Dapeng Gao](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo/pull/302)
- Use an autoclosure for the rhs of <|> - [Gordon Fontenot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo/pull/320)
- Generalize the type for `sequence` taking a dict - [Gordon Fontenot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo/pull/341)

## Misc
- (hopefully) the entire public API now has inline documentation!

If you are using `Argo` with a `class`, you will need to set `DecodedType` to your class type. This will ensure that the compiler can guarantee that the return type for the `decode` function is the proper type. If you are trying to use a `struct`, or an `enum`, this type will already be set to `Self`.
