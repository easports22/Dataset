- Removed the default values from the `$position` and `$coordinates` arguments

- Updated `contrast-switch` to calculate contrast based on the WCAG 2.0

  full compliance, though all of our manual testing passed.
- Renamed the `$coordinates` argument in the `position` mixin

  Grande, Helvetica, Noto, Franklin Gothic Medium, Century Gothic, and

- Added a `contrast-switch` mixin that switches between two colors based on the
  lightness of a another color. Great for building button styles.
- Added an `$all-text-inputs-invalid` variable to target the `:invalid`
  pseudo-class on all text-based inputs.
- The `ellipsis` mixin now takes a `$display` argument.
- Added a font stack for system fonts: `$font-stack-system`.
- Added a `hide-visually` mixin that hides an element visually while still
  allowing the content to be accessible to assistive technology,
  e.g. screen readers.
- The `font-face` mixin now allows additional CSS properties to be included in
  its block, which will output as part of the `@font-face` declaration.

### Changed
- The global default for the `modular-scale` ratio is now set to
  `$major-third` (`1.25`), instead of `$perfect-fourth` (`1.333`).
- All font stack variables are now prefixed with `$font-stack-`,
  e.g. `$font-stack-helvetica`.
- Global settings are now set via a `$bourbon` map, instead of variables.

- The `clearfix` mixin now uses `block` display, instead of `table`.

### Removed
- The `$weight` and `$style` arguments in the `font-face` mixin have been
  deprecated. Instead, you can now include these—along with other CSS
  properties—within the mixin block and they’ll be output as part of the
  `@font-face` declaration.

## New features
- A new `$global-font-file-formats` setting has been added, allowing you to globally set the font file formats you want the `font-face` mixin to use. The default is `ttf woff2 woff`.

## Improvements
- Removed the type selectors in `$all-text-inputs` and `$all-buttons` to reduce specificity.
- Font stack variables have been modernized.
- The `prefixer` mixin has been refactored and no-longer uses the `$global-prefixes` setting.

## Deprecations
- All vendor prefixing mixins have been removed. We recommend using a more robust and maintainable solution like [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
- The `em()` and `rem()` mixins have been deprecated.
- The `$monospace` font stack variable has been deprecated in favor of new `$consolas`, `$courier-new` and `$monaco` variables.
- The `triangle()` mixin has been deprecated.

## Maintenance
- The `strip-units` function is now `strip-unit`.
- The `size()` mixin now requires a comma-separated argument list: `@include size(1em, 2em);`.
- We restructured Bourbon’s directory tree to be more succinct and reduce possible conflicts. The full library now lives in a `core/` directory and all of the Sass partials are within a `bourbon/` directory to avoid polluting imports paths. _This will affect load paths if you use Bower_.

---

### Compatibility with Neat, Bitters & Refills

This alpha should be fully compatible with the latest version of Neat (`1.7.2`). Bitters `1.0` is not compatible, however the `master` branch is. We’ll get `1.1` out ASAP. At this time, most of Refills will not be compatible.

## Improvements
- [`$all-button-inputs`](http://bourbon.io/docs/#buttons-variable) is now simply `$all-buttons` (`$all-button-inputs` will continue to work until v5.0).
- `$all-buttons` also now includes the `button` element.
- [`$all-text-inputs`](http://bourbon.io/docs/#text-inputs) now includes the `textarea` element.

## Bug fixes
- [`selection`](http://bourbon.io/docs/#selection) is now compatible with LibSass and we fixed a bug which caused errors in certain versions of Ruby Sass.
- Fixed a bug with [`hide-text`](http://bourbon.io/docs/#hide-text) which caused some typefaces to extend into the visible area. It also no longer requires a `height`.

## Deprecations
- [`box-sizing`](http://bourbon.io/docs/#box-sizing) has been deprecated and will be removed in v5.0.

## Maintenance
- Bourbon now requires Sass 3.4.
- We are now [`bourbon`](https://npmjs.com/package/bourbon) on npm.
- We are now using [SCSS-Lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) with [Hound](https://houndci.com) to help us keep our Sass in tip-top shape.
- We’ve begun porting our [documentation](http://bourbon.io/docs) over to [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com), which will allow them to be versioned and make updating easier.
