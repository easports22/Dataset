  looked up by a parameter other than `id` if you have overridden `to_param` for
  the `User` model.

- We now correctly track the dirty state of `User#encrypted_password`, which
  fixes custom validations on `User#password` (e.g. validating password length)
  that were conditional on the password actually changing.
- The `clearance:install` generator will now generate a `User` model that
  inherits from `ApplicationRecord` if run on a Rails 5 app that doesn't already
  have a `User` model.

### Deprecated
- `User#password_changing` is deprecated in favor of automatic dirty tracking on
  `encrypted_password` and `password`. If you are calling this in your
  application you should be able to remove it.

- Fix the negation of the `deny_access` matcher in Rails 4.0.x on Ruby 2.2

### Deprecated
- The `authorize` filter has been deprecated in favor of `require_login`. Update
  all reference to the filter including any calls to `skip_before_filter` or
  `skip_before_action`.
- The `Clearance.root` method has been deprecated. It was used internally and
  unlikely to impact external users.

- The remember token cookie name is now customizable via
  `Clearance.configuration.cookie_name`.

### Fixed
- Fixed a redirect loop on the sign in page for applications that are still
  using the deprecated `authorize` filter.
- Signed in users that attempt to visit the sign in path are now redirected. The
  redirect URL defaults to the same URL used for the redirect after sign in, but
  can be customized by overriding `passwords_controller#url_for_signed_in_users`

### Deprecated
- `users_controller#avoid_sign_in` is now deprecated in favor of
  `redirect_signed_in_users` which is more accurately named.

  file.

  development mode.

1801814,2015-08-21T20:05:21Z,2015-09-11T18:51:44Z,,"### Added
- Add `sign_in` and `sign_in_as` helper methods to view specs. These helpers
  avoid errors from verified partial doubles that come from. See
  [462c009](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/commit/462c00965c14b2492500fbb4fecd7b84b9790bb9).

### Fixed
- `clearance:routes` generator now properly disables internal routes in your
  Clearance initializer.
- Clearance now accesses the cookie jar via ActionDispatch::Request rather than
  `Rack::Request`. This is more consistent with what Rails does internally.

### Deprecated
- `Clearance::Testing::Helpers` has been deprecated in favor of
  `Clearance::Testing::ControllerHelpers`. Most users are accessing these
  helpers by requiring `clearance/rspec` or `clearance/test_unit` and should be
  unaffected.
