This is a hotfix release to account for some tidyselect changes in the
unit tests.

Note that the upcoming version of tidyselect backtracks on some of the
changes announced for 0.7.0. The special evaluation semantics for
selection have been changed back to the old behaviour because the new
rules were causing too much trouble and confusion. From now on data
expressions (symbols and calls to `:` and `c()`) can refer to both
registered variables and to objects from the context.

However the semantics for context expressions (any calls other than to
`:` and `c()`) remain the same. Those expressions are evaluated in the
context only and cannot refer to registered variables. If you're
writing functions and refer to contextual objects, it is still a good
idea to avoid data expressions by following the advice of the 0.7.0
release notes.",https://api.github.com/users/lionel-,4465050,lionel-,https://api.github.com/repos/tidyverse/tidyr/releases/7717845/assets,https://api.github.com/repos/tidyverse/tidyr/releases/7717845,master,https://api.github.com/repos/tidyverse/tidyr/tarball/v0.7.1,https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/releases/tag/v0.7.1,https://api.github.com/repos/tidyverse/tidyr/zipball/v0.7.1,v0.7.1,False,False

supports the new tidy evaluation framework for quoting (NSE)
functions. It also uses the new tidyselect package as selecting
backend.


## Breaking changes

- If you see error messages about objects or functions not found, it
  is likely because the selecting functions are now stricter in their
  arguments An example of selecting function is `gather()` and its
  `...` argument. This change makes the code more robust by
  disallowing ambiguous scoping. Consider the following code:

  ```
  x <- 3
  df <- tibble(w = 1, x = 2, y = 3)
  gather(df, ""variable"", ""value"", 1:x)
  ```

  Does it select the first three columns (using the `x` defined in the
  global environment), or does it select the first two columns (using
  the column named `x`)?

  To solve this ambiguity, we now make a strict distinction between
  data and context expressions. A data expression is either a bare
  name or an expression like `x:y` or `c(x, y)`. In a data expression,
  you can only refer to columns from the data frame. Everything else
  is a context expression in which you can only refer to objects that
  you have defined with `<-`.

  In practice this means that you can no longer refer to contextual
  objects like this:

  ```
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, 1:ncol(mtcars))

  x <- 3
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, 1:x)
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, -(1:x))
  ```

  You now have to be explicit about where to find objects. To do so,
  you can use the quasiquotation operator `!!` which will evaluate its
  argument early and inline the result:

  ```{r}
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, !! 1:ncol(mtcars))
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, !! 1:x)
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, !! -(1:x))
  ```

  An alternative is to turn your data expression into a context
  expression by using `seq()` or `seq_len()` instead of `:`. See the
  section on tidyselect for more information about these semantics.

- Following the switch to tidy evaluation, you might see warnings
  about the ""variable context not set"". This is most likely caused by
  supplyng helpers like `everything()` to underscored versions of
  tidyr verbs. Helpers should be always be evaluated lazily. To fix
  this, just quote the helper with a formula: `drop_na(df,
  ~everything())`.

- The selecting functions are now stricter when you supply integer
  positions. If you see an error along the lines of

  ```
  `-0.949999999999999`, `-0.940000000000001`, ... must resolve to
  integer column positions, not a double vector
  ```

  please round the positions before supplying them to tidyr. Double
  vectors are fine as long as they are rounded.


## Switch to tidy evaluation

tidyr is now a tidy evaluation grammar. See the
[programming vignette](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html)
in dplyr for practical information about tidy evaluation.

The tidyr port is a bit special. While the philosophy of tidy
evaluation is that R code should refer to real objects (from the data
frame or from the context), we had to make some exceptions to this
rule for tidyr. The reason is that several functions accept bare
symbols to specify the names of _new_ columns to create (`gather()`
being a prime example). This is not tidy because the symbol do not
represent any actual object. Our workaround is to capture these
arguments using `rlang::quo_name()` (so they still support
quasiquotation and you can unquote symbols or strings). This type of
NSE is now discouraged in the tidyverse: symbols in R code should
represent real objects.

Following the switch to tidy eval the underscored variants are softly
deprecated. However they will remain around for some time and without
warning for backward compatibility.


## Switch to the tidyselect backend

The selecting backend of dplyr has been extracted in a standalone
package tidyselect which tidyr now uses for selecting variables. It is
used for selecting multiple variables (in `drop_na()`) as well as
single variables (the `col` argument of `extract()` and `separate()`,
and the `key` and `value` arguments of `spread()`). This implies the
following changes:

* The arguments for selecting a single variable now support all
  features from `dplyr::pull()`. You can supply a name or a position,
  including negative positions.

* Multiple variables are now selected a bit differently. We now make a
  strict distinction between data and context expressions. A data
  expression is either a bare name of an expression like `x:y` or
  `c(x, y)`. In a data expression, you can only refer to columns from
  the data frame. Everything else is a context expression in which you
  can only refer to objects that you have defined with `<-`.

  You can still refer to contextual objects in a data expression by
  being explicit. One way of being explicit is to unquote a variable
  from the environment with the tidy eval operator `!!`:

  ```r
  x <- 2
  drop_na(df, 2)     # Works fine
  drop_na(df, x)     # Object 'x' not found
  drop_na(df, !! x)  # Works as if you had supplied 2
  ```

  On the other hand, select helpers like `start_with()` are context
  expressions. It is therefore easy to refer to objects and they will
  never be ambiguous with data columns:

  ```{r}
  x <- ""d""
  drop_na(df, starts_with(x))
  ```

  While these special rules is in contrast to most dplyr and tidyr
  verbs (where both the data and the context are in scope) they make
  sense for selecting functions and should provide more robust and
  helpful semantics.

`nest()` and `unnest()` have been overhauled to support a useful way of structuring data frames: the **nested** data frame. In a grouped data frame, you have one row per observation, and additional metadata define the groups. In a nested data frame, you have one **row** per group, and the individual observations are stored in a column that is a list of data frames. This is a useful structure when you have lists of other objects (like models) with one element per group.
- `nest()` now produces a single list of data frames called ""data"" rather
  than a list column for each variable. Nesting variables are not included
  in nested data frames. It also works with grouped data frames made
  by `dplyr::group_by()`. You can override the default column name with `.key`.
- `unnest()` gains a `.drop` argument which controls what happens to
  other list columns. By default, they're kept if the output doesn't require
  row duplication; otherwise they're dropped.
- `unnest()` now has `mutate()` semantics for `...` - this allows you to
  unnest transformed columns more easily. (Previously it used select semantics).

## Expanding
- `expand()` once again allows you to evaluate arbitrary expressions like
  `full_seq(year)`. If you were previously using `c()` to created nested 
  combinations, you'll now need to use `nesting()` (#85, #121).
- `nesting()` and `crossing()` allow you to create nested and crossed data
  frames from individual vectors. `crossing()` is similar to 
  `base::expand.grid()`
- `full_seq(x, period)` creates the full sequence of values from `min(x)` to
  `max(x)` every `period` values.

## Minor bug fixes and improvements
- `fill()` fills in `NULL`s in list-columns.
- `fill()` gains a direction argument so that it can fill either upwards or 
  downwards (#114).
- `gather()` now stores the key column as character, by default. To revert to
  the previous behaviour of using a factor (which allows you to preserve the
  ordering of the columns), use `key_factor = TRUE` (#96).
- All tidyr verbs do the right thing for grouped data frames created by 
  `group_by()` (#122, #129, #81).
- `seq_range()` has been removed. It was never used or announced.
- `spread()` once again creates columns of mixed type when `convert = TRUE` 
  (#118, @jennybc). `spread()` with `drop = FALSE`  handles zero-length 
  factors (#56). `spread()`ing a data frame with only key and value columns 
  creates a one row output (#41).
- `unite()` now removes old columns before adding new (#89, @krlmlr).
- `separate()` now warns if defunct ... argument is used (#151, @krlmlr).

- `expand_` does SE evaluation correctly so you can pass it a character vector

- `extract()` is 10x faster because it now uses stringi instead of

  an error if the regular expression doesn't match (#72).
- `extract()` and `separate()` preserve character vectors when
  `covert` is TRUE (#99).
- The internals of `spread()` have been rewritten, and now preserve all 
  attributes of the input `value` column. This means that you can now 
  spread date (#62) and factor (#35) inputs.
- `spread()` gives a more informative error message if `key` or `value` don't
  exist in the input data (#36).
- `separate()` only displays the first 20 failures (#50). It has 
  finer control over what happens if there are two few matches:
  you can fill with missing values on either the ""left"" or the ""right"" (#49).
  `separate()` no longer throws an error if the number of pieces aren't
  as expected - instead it uses drops extra values and fills on the right
  and gives a warning.

443970,2014-07-21T19:16:47Z,2014-07-22T14:42:39Z,Initial release,"tidyr is new package that makes it easy to ""tidy"" your data. Tidy data is data that's easy to work with: it's easy to munge (with dplyr), visualise (with ggplot2 or ggvis) and model (with R's hundreds of modelling packages). The two most important properties of tidy data are:
-   Each column is a variable.
-   Each row is an observation.

Arranging your data in this way makes it easier to work with because you have a consistent way of referring to variables (as column names) and observations (as row indices). When use tidy data and tidy tools, you spend less time worrying about how to feed the output from one function into the input of another, and more time answering your questions about the data.

To tidy messy data, you first identify the variables in your dataset, then use the tools provided by tidyr to move them into columns. tidyr provides three main functions for tidying your messy data: `gather()`, `separate()` and `spread()`.

`gather()` takes multiple columns, and gathers them into key-value pairs: it makes ""wide"" data longer. Other names for gather include melt (reshape2), pivot (spreadsheets) and fold (databases). Here's an example how you might use `gather()` on a made-up dataset. In this experiment we've given three people two different drugs and recorded their heart rate:

``` .r

library(dplyr)

messy <- data.frame(
  name = c(""Wilbur"", ""Petunia"", ""Gregory""),
  a = c(67, 80, 64),
  b = c(56, 90, 50)
)
messy
#>      name  a  b
#> 1  Wilbur 67 56
#> 2 Petunia 80 90
#> 3 Gregory 64 50
```

We have three variables (name, drug and heartrate), but only name is currently in a column. We use `gather()` to gather the a and b columns into key-value pairs of drug and heartrate:

``` .r
messy %>%
  gather(drug, heartrate, a:b)
#>      name drug heartrate
#> 1  Wilbur    a        67
#> 2 Petunia    a        80
#> 3 Gregory    a        64
#> 4  Wilbur    b        56
#> 5 Petunia    b        90
#> 6 Gregory    b        50
```

Sometimes two variables are clumped together in one column. `separate()` allows you to tease them apart (`extract()` works similarly but uses regexp groups instead of a splitting pattern or position). Take this example from [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9684671) (modified slightly for brevity). We have some measurements of how much time people spend on their phones, measured at two locations (work and home), at two times. Each person has been randomly assigned to either treatment or control.

``` .r
set.seed(10)
messy <- data.frame(
  id = 1:4,
  trt = sample(rep(c('control', 'treatment'), each = 2)),
  work.T1 = runif(4),
  home.T1 = runif(4),
  work.T2 = runif(4),
  home.T2 = runif(4)
)
```

To tidy this data, we first use `gather()` to turn columns `work.T1`, `home.T1`, `work.T2` and `home.T2` into a key-value pair of key and time. (Only the first eight rows are shown to save space.)

``` .r
tidier <- messy %>%
  gather(key, time, -id, -trt)
tidier %>% head(8)
#>   id       trt     key    time
#> 1  1 treatment work.T1 0.08514
#> 2  2   control work.T1 0.22544
#> 3  3 treatment work.T1 0.27453
#> 4  4   control work.T1 0.27231
#> 5  1 treatment home.T1 0.61583
#> 6  2   control home.T1 0.42967
#> 7  3 treatment home.T1 0.65166
#> 8  4   control home.T1 0.56774
```

Next we use `separate()` to split the key into location and time, using a regular expression to describe the character that separates them.

``` .r
tidy <- tidier %>%
  separate(key, into = c(""location"", ""time""), sep = ""\\."") 
tidy %>% head(8)
#>   id       trt location time    time
#> 1  1 treatment     work   T1 0.08514
#> 2  2   control     work   T1 0.22544
#> 3  3 treatment     work   T1 0.27453
#> 4  4   control     work   T1 0.27231
#> 5  1 treatment     home   T1 0.61583
#> 6  2   control     home   T1 0.42967
#> 7  3 treatment     home   T1 0.65166
#> 8  4   control     home   T1 0.56774
```

The last tool, `spread()`, takes two columns (a key-value pair) and spreads them in to multiple columns, making ""long"" data wider. Spread is known by other names in other places: it's cast in reshape2, unpivot in spreadsheets and unfold in databases. `spread()` is used when you have variables that form rows instead of columns. You need `spread()` less frequently than `gather()` or `separate()` so to learn more, check out the documentation and the demos.

Just as reshape2 did less than reshape, tidyr does less than reshape2. It's designed specifically for tidying data, not general reshaping. In particular, existing methods only work for data frames, and tidyr never aggregates. This makes each function in tidyr simpler: each function does one thing well. For more complicated operations you can string together multiple simple tidyr and dplyr functions with `%>%`.

You can learn more about the underlying principles in my [tidy data paper](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html). To see more examples of data tidying, read the vignette, `vignette(""tidy-data"")`, or check out the demos, `demo(package = ""tidyr"")`. Alternatively, check out some of the [great stackoverflow answers](http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=votes&q=%5br%5d%20tidyr) that use tidyr.
