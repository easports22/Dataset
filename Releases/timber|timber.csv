5059739,2016-12-30T03:17:17Z,2017-01-03T19:30:20Z,Comment Threads and WordPress 4.7,"### Comment Threads

You can now more easily fetch an manipulate threads of comments thanks to the fancy new [CommentThread object](https://github.com/timber/timber/blob/master/lib/CommentThread.php)! Why?
- Adds depth info
- Nests by default (thus, the change from 1.1.\* to 1.2)
- Supports future syntax features

##### Usage:

**`post.twig`**

``` twig
<h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
<article>{{ post.content }}</article>
<section class=""comments"">
{% for comment in post.comments %}
  {% include ""comment.twig"" %}
{% endfor %}
```

**`comment.twig`**

``` twig
<div class=""comment-{{ comment.id }} depth-{{ comment.depth }}"">
  {{ comment.content }}
  <p class=""who"">{{ comment.author.name }}</p>
  <div class=""replies"">
    {% include ""comment.twig"" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

You can also do fun stuff when fetching comments like `{% post.comments.order('DESC') %}` or `{% post.comments.orderby('comment_author') %}

### WordPress 4.7

The new version of WP introduced a bevy of small changes that broke a number of low-level Timber features. These were items caught by UnitTests (no reports of users seeing strange behavior), but out of an abundance of caution these were held until Timber 1.2 to reduce possibility of breaking live sites.

74294,2013-10-23T19:15:29Z,2013-10-23T19:17:47Z,"Caching, Changes to Render + More Caching","Huge improvements coming in this release of Timber. Here's the big stuff:

#### Caching:

@mgmartel did some great work on caching. Now when go to render, you can set an expires time (in seconds):

``` php
Timber::render('single.twig', $data, 1200)
```

There are several different caching methods you can send:

``` php
Timber::render('single.twig', $data, 1200, TimberLoader::CACHE_USE_DEFAULT)
Timber::render('single.twig', $data, 1200, TimberLoader::CACHE_SITE_TRANSIENT)
Timber::render('single.twig', $data, 1200, TimberLoader::CACHE_TRANSIENT)
Timber::render('single.twig', $data, 1200, TimberLoader::CACHE_OBJECT)
```

... if you send nothing (as the first example) it will default to `CACHE_USE_DEFAULT` which is actually transient. WordPress transients first use a persistent object cache (if you have it enabled) or fallback to using the database cache. I've noticed great performance boosts from this, giving me 50% - 65% decrease in rendering time. There are slight benefits to object cache (speed-wise), but the gains are very similar for DB cache

###### In-Template Caching

You can also use the `{% cache %}` tag inside of a `.twig` file to cache parts of the template. @mgmartel [explains the details](https://github.com/jarednova/timber/pull/80)

---

#### Changes to `Timber::render`

**Warning: Breaking Change** That said, this is an edge-case. It used to be that the third argument for `Timber::render` was $echo (which defaulted to true). In some circumstances you might have had it just return the rendered template w/o echo'ing so that you could store it separately. Now, you can do this with `Timber::compile` :

``` php
$megamenu = get_my_mega_menu();
$data['megamenu_rendered'] = Timber::compile('megamenu.twig', $megamenu);
Timber::render('page.twig', $data, 3600);
```

---

#### Post next/prev

@thisislawatts contributed next/prev post methods. Inside of a post object you can do:

``` twig
{{post.get_next}}
```

... to return the next post (and also do `{{post.get_next.title}}`, etc.)

#### Misc
- @daslicht made `post.get_preview` a little simpler for when you want to omit the ""read more""
- Misc cleanup to keep making things more consistent from object-to-object.
- Some small internal caching things to prevent extra queries

```
- Renamed ""WPHelper"" to more namespace-friendly ""TimberHelper."" Don't worry old WPHelper calls will still work, but that class will be deprecated in an upcoming version.
