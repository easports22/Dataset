8165024,2017-10-18T15:13:51Z,2017-10-18T16:16:58Z,v2.0.0,"![Mastodon](https://i.imgur.com/NhZc40l.png)

### Breaking changes:

- All `id` attributes in the REST API responses, including attributes that end in `_id`, are now returned as strings instead of integers. This is because large integers cannot be encoded in JSON losslessly, and all IDs in Mastodon are now bigint. Some apps will not work with this release until they are updated
- Mastodon will no longer deliver private and direct statuses to OStatus-based recipients (that means pre-1.6.0 Mastodon, too)
- Stylesheet customizations now work differently due to the new theme feature. See upgrade notes for details.

### Features:

**Custom emoji** (#4988, #5243, #5258, #5002)

Admins may upload 50KB PNG images and assign them shortcodes. These images act as custom emojis that can be embedded inline in statuses using those shortcodes, like `:example:`. The emojis display correctly between different instances, but users can only use their local emojis. However, it is simple enough to make a local copy of a desired emoji.

Admins may disable individual remote emojis from being displayed on their instance. The domain block reject media option also works on them.

**Add support for multiple themes** (#4959, #5336)

Besides the old custom.scss way, admins may install additional themes. When more than one theme is installed, the option to select your preference appears in user's preferences.

**Replace EmojiOne emoji pack with Twemoji** (#5046)

The newer releases of EmojiOne have switched their license and availability. To get access to all the latest standard emojis, we switched packs to Twemoji, which has a more permissive license, which is used by Twitter and Discord.

**Add emoji autosuggestions** (#5053)

When beginning to type a shortcode, an autosuggestion appears instantly, like for usernames. Upon selection it inserts the unicode character into the text. Entering a standard emoji's shortcode and leaving it as such now is interpreted as you meaning to leave it as plain text, it will not be converted to unicode server-side to avoid garbling code and IPv6 addresses that contain syntax that is similar to shortcodes.

**New emoji picker** (#5046, #5275)

The emoji picker has been improved. It will display your instances's custom emojis as well as keep track of the emojis you use frequently and your selected skin tone modifier.

**New error page graphic. Other error page improvements** (#5067, #5099)

The 500 error page is now generated during the assets:precompile rake task, meaning that it can use the same stylesheets and assets as the rest of the application. The loading of external Google Fonts was removed from the page. Custom style adjustments will also work on it now. And there's a new elephant graphic on it.

**Better primary ID generation** (#4801, #5260)

The so-called Snowflake algorithm of generating primary IDs for statuses is used now. It includes timestamps in the ID, making it possible to sort items chronologically regardless of when they were actually inserted into the database, without giving up performance or the uniqueness required for keyset pagination. It also makes it harder to guess how large someone's database table truly is. When resolving old statuses from other instances, such as for boosts, search or thread resolving, this means that newly resolved old statuses will no longer appear at the top of public timelines.

**Hotkeys in web UI** (#5164)

The web UI can now be navigated and controlled with a variety of hotkeys.

For example, `1`-`9` will focus a corresponding column (skipping the compose drawer, that is). `n` will focus the compose textarea, while `alt+n` will not only focus it but also reset it. `s` will focus the search form.

When a timeline is focused, `j`/down-arrow and `k`/up-arrow move the focus down/up; `o`/enter expands the status, `p` opens the author's profile, `r` to reply, `m` to mention author, `f` to favourite, `b` to boost.

In terms of general navigation, backspace is bound to navigating backward. A quick combination of `g` and certain letters will take you to a particular page: `s` to start, `h` to home, `n` to notifications, `l` to local timeline, `t` to federated timeline, `f` to your favourites, `u` to your own profile, `p` to your pinned toots, `b` to your blocked users, `m` to your muted users.

**Add ability to specify alternative text for media attachments** (#5123)

After uploading a media attachment but before submitting the toot, the description of the upload can be specified to allow people who use screen readers to enjoy the upload, too. Up to 420 characters can be used.

**Redesign public hashtag pages** (#5237)

The public hashtag pages are used almost exclusively by non-logged-in users, so they should act more like landing pages. The updated design uses the same embedded timeline component as the frontpage, meaning there are auto-updates and infinite scroll and it looks more like what you get if you sign up. It also displays login and sign-up buttons on the side, as well as a few benefits of Mastodon.

**Implement dynamic e-mail blacklist for admins** (#5109)

Previously the only way to prevent an e-mail domain from being used by new sign-ups was to specify an environment variable and restart Mastodon. This does not work well enough. Now this setting can be changed inside the admin UI without restarting Mastodon, instead.

**Other:**

- After 7 days of repeated delivery failures, give up on inbox delivery to reduce wasted effort (#5131)
- Send streaming API delete to people mentioned in status, so they would get it even if they don't follow the author (#5103)
- In detailed status view, display the attachment uncropped if there's only one of it (#5054)
- When a streaming API status arrives, sort it into conversations live so you don't have to reload the conversation to see it (#5206)
- New Material app icon for Chrome, new icons for iOS, Microsoft (#5291, #5321)
- New API: GET /api/v1/apps/verify_credentials to confirm app works (#5112)
- Reorganize preferences page (#5161, #4447)
- Admins can now add moderation notes to accounts (#5240)
- New preference for reducing animations in web UI to prevent motion sickness (#5393)

### Upgrade notes:

Non-Docker only:

- The recommended Ruby version has been bumped to 2.4.2. However, it is only a recommendation. If you would like to stay with 2.4.1, simply overwrite the value in `.ruby-version`
- Dependency updates: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

Both Docker and non-Docker:

- This release includes database migrations, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:migrate` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails db:migrate`). **Depending on your database size, this migration may take a long while! It may also lead to some downtime. Make sure you have backups.** This is because we are upgrading a multitude of database columns from int to bigint to make sure they're future-proof.
- This release includes changes to assets, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails assets:precompile`)

Optionally:

- `custom.scss` is no longer automatically loaded because the feature has been reworked into themes. Change to `default: styles/custom.scss` in `config/themes.yml` to restore old behaviour

### Troubleshooting

- If you have upgraded to the master branch before v2.0.0rc1 and your custom emoji now fail to load, perform this rake task: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake paperclip:refresh:thumbnails CLASS=CustomEmoji`

### Features:

**Custom emoji** (#4988, #5243, #5258, #5002)

Admins may upload 50KB PNG images and assign them shortcodes. These images act as custom emojis that can be embedded inline in statuses using those shortcodes, like `:example:`. The emojis display correctly between different instances, but users can only use their local emojis. However, it is simple enough to make a local copy of a desired emoji.

Admins may disable individual remote emojis from being displayed on their instance. The domain block reject media option also works on them.

**Add support for multiple themes** (#4959)

Besides the old custom.scss way, admins may install additional themes. When more than one theme is installed, the option to select your preference appears in user's preferences.

**Replace EmojiOne emoji pack with Twemoji** (#5046)

The newer releases of EmojiOne have switched their license and availability. To get access to all the latest standard emojis, we switched packs to Twemoji, which has a more permissive license, which is used by Twitter and Discord.

**Add emoji autosuggestions** (#5053)

When beginning to type a shortcode, an autosuggestion appears instantly, like for usernames. Upon selection it inserts the unicode character into the text. Entering a standard emoji's shortcode and leaving it as such now is interpreted as you meaning to leave it as plain text, it will not be converted to unicode server-side to avoid garbling code and IPv6 addresses that contain syntax that is similar to shortcodes.

**New emoji picker** (#5046, #5275)

The emoji picker has been improved. It will display your instances's custom emojis as well as keep track of the emojis you use frequently and your selected skin tone modifier.

**New error page graphic. Other error page improvements** (#5067, #5099)

The 500 error page is now generated during the assets:precompile rake task, meaning that it can use the same stylesheets and assets as the rest of the application. The loading of external Google Fonts was removed from the page. Custom style adjustments will also work on it now. And there's a new elephant graphic on it.

**Better primary ID generation** (#4801, #5260)

The so-called Snowflake algorithm of generating primary IDs for statuses is used now. It includes timestamps in the ID, making it possible to sort items chronologically regardless of when they were actually inserted into the database, without giving up performance or the uniqueness required for keyset pagination. It also makes it harder to guess how large someone's database table truly is. When resolving old statuses from other instances, such as for boosts, search or thread resolving, this means that newly resolved old statuses will no longer appear at the top of public timelines.

**Hotkeys in web UI** (#5164)

The web UI can now be navigated and controlled with a variety of hotkeys.

For example, `1`-`9` will focus a corresponding column (skipping the compose drawer, that is). `n` will focus the compose textarea, while `alt+n` will not only focus it but also reset it. `s` will focus the search form.

When a timeline is focused, `j`/down-arrow and `k`/up-arrow move the focus down/up; `o`/enter expands the status, `p` opens the author's profile, `r` to reply, `m` to mention author, `f` to favourite, `b` to boost.

In terms of general navigation, backspace is bound to navigating backward. A quick combination of `g` and certain letters will take you to a particular page: `s` to start, `h` to home, `n` to notifications, `l` to local timeline, `t` to federated timeline, `f` to your favourites, `u` to your own profile, `p` to your pinned toots, `b` to your blocked users, `m` to your muted users.

**Add ability to specify alternative text for media attachments** (#5123)

After uploading a media attachment but before submitting the toot, the description of the upload can be specified to allow people who use screen readers to enjoy the upload, too. Up to 420 characters can be used.

**Redesign public hashtag pages** (#5237)

The public hashtag pages are used almost exclusively by non-logged-in users, so they should act more like landing pages. The updated design uses the same embedded timeline component as the frontpage, meaning there are auto-updates and infinite scroll and it looks more like what you get if you sign up. It also displays login and sign-up buttons on the side, as well as a few benefits of Mastodon.

**Implement dynamic e-mail blacklist for admins** (#5109)

Previously the only way to prevent an e-mail domain from being used by new sign-ups was to specify an environment variable and restart Mastodon. This does not work well enough. Now this setting can be changed inside the admin UI without restarting Mastodon, instead.

**Other:**

- After 7 days of repeated delivery failures, give up on inbox delivery to reduce wasted effort (#5131)
- Send streaming API delete to people mentioned in status, so they would get it even if they don't follow the author (#5103)
- In detailed status view, display the attachment uncropped if there's only one of it (#5054)
- When a streaming API status arrives, sort it into conversations live so you don't have to reload the conversation to see it (#5206)
- New Material app icon for Chrome (#5291)
- New API: GET /api/v1/apps/verify_credentials to confirm app works (#5112)
- Reorganize preferences page (#5161, #4447)
- Admins can now add moderation notes to accounts (#5240)

### Upgrade notes:

Non-Docker only:

- The recommended Ruby version has been bumped to 2.4.2. However, it is only a recommendation. If you would like to stay with 2.4.1, simply overwrite the value in `.ruby-version`
- Dependency updates: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

Both Docker and non-Docker:

- This release includes database migrations, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:migrate` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails db:migrate`). **Depending on your database size, this migration may take a long while! It may also lead to some downtime. Make sure you have backups.** This is because we are upgrading a multitude of database columns from int to bigint to make sure they're future-proof.
- This release includes changes to assets, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails assets:precompile`)

Optionally:

- `custom.scss` is no longer automatically loaded because the feature has been reworked into themes. Change to `default: styles/custom.scss` in `config/themes.yml` to restore old behaviour

> **ActivityPub** is a new federated web protocol. From this release onward it is the **primary protocol of Mastodon**. We will remain compatible with OStatus for the foreseeable future, but version 2.0 of Mastodon will stop sending private toots over it. After installation, accounts in the database will slowly start upgrading. One of the immediate and obvious perks of this new protocol is more complete conversation views on every instance (presuming all participants are upgraded). For more, [see this blog post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/progress-report-14076545).

> **ActivityPub** is a new federated web protocol. From this release onward it is the **primary protocol of Mastodon**. We will remain compatible with OStatus for the foreseeable future, but version 2.0 of Mastodon will stop sending private toots over it. After installation, accounts in the database will slowly start upgrading. One of the immediate and obvious perks of this new protocol is more complete conversation views on every instance (presuming all participants are upgraded). For more, [see this blog post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/progress-report-14076545).

**Upgrade notes:**

Non-Docker only:

- New system package dependencies: `libicu-dev libidn11-dev`
- Dependency updates: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

Both Docker and non-Docker:

- To enable Web Push notifications, you should generate a few extra secrets and put them into your environment (usually `.env.production`). Generate the secrets/variables with: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake mastodon:webpush:generate_vapid_key` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rake mastodon:webpush:generate_vapid_key`)
- This release includes database migrations, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:migrate` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails db:migrate`). There are some column data updates, so the migration may take a while if your tables have many rows. If you get a lock error, you'll need to shut down the Mastodon web process during the upgrade.
- This release includes changes to assets, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails assets:precompile`)
- The file `sw.js` (service worker definition) served from the public directory should be served with no cache headers or cache headers with max-age 0 (basically, don't cache it)
- There are no more mandatory regular cronjobs, because all important tasks have been moved to Sidekiq. Deprecated rake tasks like `mastodon:daily` now do nothing.

If push notifications are not being sent and the server logs show errors like `Webpush::InvalidSubscription - 400 Unauthorized Registration` or `Request did not validate Invalid bearer token: Auth > 24 hours in the future`, most likely the server time is not accurate (you can use `ntp` to synchronize it and prevent it from drifting).

If you're upgrading from a version prior to 1.4.2, you may need to run the following command to prepare for the 1.4.2 referential integrity migration: 

 - `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails mastodon:maintenance:prepare_for_foreign_keys` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails mastodon:maintenance:prepare_for_foreign_keys`)

**Upgrade notes:**

Non-Docker only:

- New system package dependencies: `libicu-dev libidn11-dev`
- Dependency updates: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

Both Docker and non-Docker:

- To enable Web Push notifications, you should generate a few extra secrets and put them into your environment (usually `.env.production`). Generate the secrets/variables with: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake mastodon:webpush:generate_vapid_key` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rake mastodon:webpush:generate_vapid_key`)
- This release includes database migrations, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:migrate` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails db:migrate`)
- This release includes changes to assets, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails assets:precompile`)
- The file `sw.js` (service worker definition) served from the public directory should be served with max-age 0 (no caching)
- There are no more mandatory regular cronjobs, because all important tasks have been moved to Sidekiq. Deprecated rake tasks like `mastodon:daily` now do nothing.

**Upgrade notes:**

This release adds database-level constraints for ensure cross-referential integrity. Previously, incorrect records could have persisted due to race conditions and request timeouts in the Ruby codebase. Because Postgres cannot create the constraints if violations of the constraints already exist, I have written a rake task for cleaning up the incorrect records in the database that you should execute before the migration.

If for some reason you cannot deploy the code first without running database migrations in the process (e.g. Capistrano deployments), you can simply [copypaste the code from the rake task](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/lib/tasks/mastodon.rake#L182) into the Rails console and execute it that way.

Because of how Postgres executes the creation of foreign keys, if Mastodon activity is happening at the same time, the migration may fail with a ""deadlock"". In such a case I recommend disabling user access to Mastodon during the migration, which shouldn't take longer than a minute.

Non-Docker only:

- Dependency updates: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

Both Docker and non-Docker:

- Run the rake task to prepare for the database migrations: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails mastodon:maintenance:prepare_for_foreign_keys` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails mastodon:maintenance:prepare_for_foreign_keys`)
- This release includes database migrations, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:migrate` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails db:migrate`)
- This release includes changes to assets, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails assets:precompile`)
- The upgrade from Rails 5.0 to 5.1 will break cached entities. Cache lives for 10 minutes, so you can either wait for it to go away after 10 minutes, or clear Rails cache with `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails r Rails.cache.clear` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails r Rails.cache.clear`)

**Upgrade notes:**

Non-Docker only:

- This release switches the minimum supported Node.js version from 4 to 6
- Three additional system packages are required: `pkg-config libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler`
- Dependency updates: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

Docker-only:

- Processes inside Docker no longer run as root. Existing installations will require you to change directory ownership of the uploads volume to a different UID/GID: something like `sudo chown -R 991:991 public/system` (the default UID/GID of the new in-Docker user is 991/991)

Both Docker and non-Docker:

- If you have `CDN_HOST` set, make sure it contains the protocol part (`http://` or `https://`), if it does not, adjust it before doing the next step
- If you set a non-default `STREAMING_API_BASE_URL`, change the protocol part to `ws://` or `wss://` respectively
- This release includes changes to assets, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails assets:precompile`)
- Generated assets now live under public/packs instead of public/assets. This is mostly irrelevant but might affect some custom proxying configurations.
- This release includes database migrations, that means you need to run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:migrate` (in Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rails db:migrate`)

6296935,2017-05-06T11:53:43Z,2017-05-06T11:59:04Z,v1.3.3,"This is a patch release that backports a few important improvements from the upcoming v1.4 release which is still a work in progress.

*PuSH subscriptions is how Mastodon instances send each other statuses of followed accounts. They have to be periodically renewed (by default they run for around 30 days). Because Scalingo does not support cronjobs, and Heroku requires a separate scheduler setup, those installations are in most dire need of this update, which moves the renewal code into the Sidekiq process instead. But everyone else will also benefit from the renewals being more efficient and failure-resistant. Previous behaviour did not have retries, so if a subscription request failed, it would only be retried when you next ran the cronjob, which meant gaps in followed people's timelines for days or longer.*

**Fixes**:

- PuSH subscriptions refresh now run through Sidekiq, it no longer requires cronjobs (old `mastodon:push:refresh` rake task becomes no-op), more efficient/less hard-hitting order in which subscription requests are sent, better handling of errors and retrial in case of temporary failures (#2799) 
- Handle out-of-order delete events (e.g. when delete arrives before original status - future original status will get ignored now) (#2734)
- Always respond with 200 to PuSH deliveries instead of 201/202, check Salmon verification synchronously to return useful error to remote server (#2733)

- This release includes dependency updates, that means you need to run `bundle install` (not required in Docker deployments)

**Upgrade notes:**

- An upgrade to Ruby 2.4.1 means having to install Ruby 2.4.1 and reinstalling the bundler gem as a minimum: `rbenv install 2.4.1; gem install bundler --no-ri` (not required in Docker deployments)
- This release includes dependency updates, that means you need to run `bundle install` and `yarn install` (not required in Docker deployments)
- Most importantly, the hover-to-play update for GIF avatars means static versions of GIF avatars need to be generated, or else they wouldn't show up. A rake task has been added for this one-time occasion: `rake mastodon:maintenance:add_static_avatars` (This will iterate over all accounts who have GIF avatars or headers, and re-process them to generate a static non-GIF version. Please mind that this means downloading and uploading data if your files are stored in the cloud like Amazon S3 or GCS, which could incur costs. If you don't run this task, users with GIF avatars will simply have to re-upload theirs manually)
