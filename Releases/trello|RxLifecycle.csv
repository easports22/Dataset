`Observable`, `Flowable`, `Single`, `Maybe` and `Completable`. Unlike before, there's
no extra steps you have to take to make it work with types other than `Observable`.

- [#143](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/143): Split Android parts of rxlifecycle into rxlifecycle-android
  
  Now the `rxlifecycle` dependency is a pure Java core. To use RxLifecycle with Android, you should also include
  `rxlifecycle-android` as well now.
  
  `RxLifecycle` methods that are for Android (`bindActivity()`, `bindFragment()` and `bindView()`) are now in
  `RxLifecycleAndroid` (found in the `rxlifecycle-android` artifact).
  
  Deprecated methods in `RxLifecycle` were removed as well.

  Replace `ActivityLifecycleProvider` and `FragmentLifecycleProvider` with `LifecycleProvider<T>`.
  
  This means that you need to replace `ActivityLifecycleProvider` with `LifecycleProvider<ActivityEvent>` and
  `FragmentLifecycleProvider` with `LifecycleProvider<FragmentEvent>`.

  While this fixes some intractable problems that could occur with the old system, it also includes a major behavior
  change: when the bind decides to stop subscribing, it calls `onCompleted` (whereas before it would just
  unsubscribe).
  
  When upgrading, you should check that your usages of `onCompleted` (either in `subscribe()`, `doOnCompleted()`,
  or `doOnTerminate()`) can handle the sequence ending due to the lifecycle bind.
  
  If you still need the old behavior in some spots, you should handle the `Subscription` yourself manually (and call
  `unsubscribe()` when appropriate).
