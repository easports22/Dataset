#### Features
* Adds support for multiple event systems (libuv, ASIO & epoll).
* Highly optimized memory usage - 37% of prior version 0.13.0.
* Optimized parser and control frame receive paths - 4-8x the performance.
* Optional thread safety of documented functions (compile with UWS_THREADSAFE).
* Hub::connect now takes optional headers such as origin.
* Removes CMake, improves native Makefile, adds native VC++.vcxproj.
* Adds onTransfer callback.
* Mingw64 compiler support.

#### Fixes
* Sets SOCK_CLOEXEC on Linux and FreeBSD.
* Properly handles WSAEWOULDBLOCK on Windows.
* Memory leaks on send errors.
* Parser crash on very long messages.
* Travis CI now runs all native tests with every commit.
* Removes Node.js addon from main repository, it now lives in bindings repo.

#### Interface changes
* In prior versions a WebSocket could be represented by a void pointer, an uv_poll_t pointer or a WebSocket object. This kind of chameleon black magic is removed and there is now only WebSocket pointers in use.
* WebSockets are handed out as pointers in all event handlers.
* Send callbacks now give a pointer to a WebSocket rather than a void pointer.
* There is no longer any getPollHandle() and you cannot construct a WebSocket from an uv_poll_t pointer.
* Lots of encapsulation fixes, most structs are now exposing only the official API and not its internals.
