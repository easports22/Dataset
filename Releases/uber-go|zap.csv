Anyone using a semver-aware dependency manager should now pin to `^1`.

Breaking changes:

* [#366][]: Add byte-oriented APIs to encoders to log UTF-8 encoded text without casting from `[]byte` to `string`.
* [#364][]: To support buffering outputs, add `Sync` methods to `zapcore.Core`, `zap.Logger`, and `zap.SugaredLogger`.
* [#371][]: Rename the `testutils` package to `zaptest`, which is less likely to clash with other testing helpers.

Bugfixes:

* [#362][]: Make the ISO8601 time formatters fixed-width, which is friendlier for tab-separated console output.
* [#369][]: Remove the automatic locks in `zapcore.NewCore`, which allows zap to work with concurrency-safe `WriteSyncer` implementations.
* [#347][]: Stop reporting errors when trying to `fsync` standard out on Linux systems.
* [#373][]: Report the correct caller from zap's standard library interoperability wrappers.

Enhancements:

* [#348][]: Add a registry allowing third-party encodings to work with zap's built-in `Config`.
* [#327][]: Make the representation of logger callers configurable (like times, levels, and durations).
* [#376][]: Allow third-party encoders to use their own buffer pools, which removes the last performance advantage that zap's encoders have over plugins.
* [#346][]: Add `CombineWriteSyncers`, a convenience function to tee multiple `WriteSyncer`s and lock the result.
* [#365][]: Make zap's stacktraces compatible with mid-stack inlining (coming in Go 1.9).
* [#372][]: Export zap's observing logger as `zaptest/observer`. This makes it easier for particularly punctilious users to unit test their application's logging.

Breaking changes:
- [#316](https://github.com/uber-go/zap/pull/316): Zap's global loggers are now fully concurrency-safe (previously, users had to ensure that `ReplaceGlobals` was called before the loggers were in use). However, they must now be accessed via the `L()` and `S()` functions. Users can update their projects with
  
  ```
  gofmt -r ""zap.L -> zap.L()"" -w .
  gofmt -r ""zap.S -> zap.S()"" -w .
  ```
- [#309](https://github.com/uber-go/zap/pull/309) and [#317](https://github.com/uber-go/zap/pull/317): RC1 was mistakenly shipped with invalid JSON and YAML struct tags on all config structs. This release fixes the tags and adds static analysis to prevent similar bugs in the future.

Bugfixes:
- [#321](https://github.com/uber-go/zap/pull/321): Redirecting the standard library's `log` output now correctly reports the logger's caller.

Enhancements:
- [#325](https://github.com/uber-go/zap/pull/325) and [#333](https://github.com/uber-go/zap/pull/333): Zap now transparently supports non-standard, rich errors like those produced by `github.com/pkg/errors`.
- [#326](https://github.com/uber-go/zap/pull/326): Though `New(nil)` continues to return a no-op logger, `NewNop()` is now preferred. Users can update their projects with `gofmt -r 'zap.New(nil) -> zap.NewNop()' -w .`.
- [#300](https://github.com/uber-go/zap/pull/300): Incorrectly importing zap as `github.com/uber-go/zap` now returns a more informative error.

- User-facing types and functions remain in the `zap` package. Code relevant largely to extension authors is now in the `zapcore` package.
- The `zapcore.Core` type makes it easy for third-party packages to use zap's internals but provide a different user-facing API.
- `Logger` is now a concrete type instead of an interface.
- A less verbose (though slower) logging API is included by default.
- Package-global loggers `L` and `S` are included.
- A human-friendly console encoder is included.
- A declarative config struct allows common logger configurations to be managed as configuration instead of code.
- Sampling is more accurate, and doesn't depend on the standard library's shared timer heap.
