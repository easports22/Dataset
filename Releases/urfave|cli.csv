4725647,2016-11-22T04:36:10Z,2016-11-22T04:37:08Z,cli v1.19.1,"### Fixed
- Fixes regression introduced in 1.19.0 where using an `ActionFunc` as
  the `Action` for a command would cause it to error rather than calling the
  function. Should not have a affected declarative cases using `func(c
  *cli.Context) err)`.
- Shell completion now handles the case where the user specifies
  `--generate-bash-completion` immediately after a flag that takes an argument.
  Previously it call the application with `--generate-bash-completion` as the
  flag value.

4647445,2016-11-19T18:55:36Z,2016-11-19T19:04:36Z,cli v1.19.0,"### Added
- `FlagsByName` was added to make it easy to sort flags (e.g. `sort.Sort(cli.FlagsByName(app.Flags))`)
- A `Description` field was added to `App` for a more detailed description of
  the application (similar to the existing `Description` field on `Command`)
- Flag type code generation via `go generate`
- Write to stderr and exit 1 if action returns non-nil error
- Added support for TOML to the `altsrc` loader
- `SkipArgReorder` was added to allow users to skip the argument reordering.
  This is useful if you want to consider all ""flags"" after an argument as
  arguments rather than flags (the default behavior of the stdlib `flag`
  library). This is backported functionality from the [removal of the flag
  reordering](https://github.com/urfave/cli/pull/398) in the unreleased version
  2
- For formatted errors (those implementing `ErrorFormatter`), the errors will
  be formatted during output. Compatible with `pkg/errors`.

### Changed
- Raise minimum tested/supported Go version to 1.2+

### Fixed
- Consider empty environment variables as set (previously environment variables
  with the equivalent of `""""` would be skipped rather than their value used).
- Return an error if the value in a given environment variable cannot be parsed
  as the flag type. Previously these errors were silently swallowed.
- Print full error when an invalid flag is specified (which includes the invalid flag)
- `App.Writer` defaults to `stdout` when `nil`
- If no action is specified on a command or app, the help is now printed instead of `panic`ing
- `App.Metadata` is initialized automatically now (previously was `nil` unless initialized)
- Correctly show help message if `-h` is provided to a subcommand
- `context.(Global)IsSet` now respects environment variables. Previously it
  would return `false` if a flag was specified in the environment rather than
  as an argument
- Removed deprecation warnings to STDERR to avoid them leaking to the end-user
- `altsrc`s import paths were updated to use `gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v1`. This
  fixes issues that occurred when `gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v1` was imported as well
  as `altsrc` where Go would complain that the types didn't match

- `context.GlobalBoolT` was added as an analogue to `context.GlobalBool`
- Support for hiding commands by setting `Hidden: true` -- this will hide the
  commands in help output

### Changed
- `Float64Flag`, `IntFlag`, and `DurationFlag` default values are no longer
  quoted in help text output.
- All flag types now include `(default: {value})` strings following usage when a
  default value can be (reasonably) detected.
- `IntSliceFlag` and `StringSliceFlag` usage strings are now more consistent
  with non-slice flag types
- Apps now exit with a code of 3 if an unknown subcommand is specified
  (previously they printed ""No help topic for..."", but still exited 0. This
  makes it easier to script around apps built using `cli` since they can trust
  that a 0 exit code indicated a successful execution.

- Support for placeholders in flag usage strings
- `App.Metadata` map for arbitrary data/state management
- `Set` and `GlobalSet` methods on `*cli.Context` for altering values after
  parsing.
- Support for nested lookup of dot-delimited keys in structures loaded from
  YAML.

### Changed
- The `App.Action` and `Command.Action` now prefer a return signature of
  `func(*cli.Context) error`, as defined by `cli.ActionFunc`.  If a non-nil
  `error` is returned, there may be two outcomes:
  - If the error fulfills `cli.ExitCoder`, then `os.Exit` will be called
    automatically
  - Else the error is bubbled up and returned from `App.Run`
- Specifying an `Action` with the legacy return signature of
  `func(*cli.Context)` will produce a deprecation message to stderr
- Specifying an `Action` that is not a `func` type will produce a non-zero exit
  from `App.Run`
- Specifying an `Action` func that has an invalid (input) signature will
  produce a non-zero exit from `App.Run`

### Deprecated
- <a name=""deprecated-cli-app-runandexitonerror""></a>
  `cli.App.RunAndExitOnError`, which should now be done by returning an error
  that fulfills `cli.ExitCoder` to `cli.App.Run`.

  `cli.App.Action` of `func(*cli.Context)`, which should now have a return
  signature of `func(*cli.Context) error`, as defined by `cli.ActionFunc`.
