5011422,2016-12-25T20:52:31Z,2016-12-25T21:03:00Z,,"## Redcarpet v3.4.0

This new release ships with a bunch of bug fixes especially regarding anchor generation.

### Improvements to anchor generation

The anchor generation now relies on a djb2 hashing algorithm whenever the generated anchor is empty as non alpha-numeric chars. This is specifically interesting for CJK contents as Redcarpet used to generate empty anchors dealing with titles in these locales.

Special thanks to Alexey Kopytko and namusyaka for their work on that !

Also now, the html-escaped entities are removed from anchors generated with the `HTML` render in order to be consistent with the `HTML_TOC` render and as it is more expected.

### Other improvements
- Table headers don't require a minimum of three dashes anymore; a single one can be used for each row.
- The Markdown and rendering options are now exposed through a `Hash` inside the `@options` instance variable inside your custom render objects.

### Bug fixes
- Multiple single quote pairs are parsed correctly with SmartyPants.
- Remove periods at the end of URLs when autolinking to make sure
  that links at the end of a sentence get properly generated.
- Avoid escaping ampersands in href links.

This new release ships with a bunch of bug fixes and improvements especially regarding anchor generation.

### Improvements to anchors

The anchor generation algorithm has been improved. It now correctly strips out non-alphanumeric chars from the generated string ; it tries as much as possible to match the behavior of the Active Support's `#parameterize` method.

Moreover, Redcarpet used to HTML-escape anchors rendered through the `HTMl_TOC` render. This is no longer the case but if you want this behavior back for any reason, you can now pass the `:escape_html` option instantiating the object.

### Redcarpet's command line interface

The plain old Ruby file that was provided as a bin script now relies on a brand new API that you can use and that uses Ruby's OptionParser.

This allows you to create custom scripts for your needs. You can handle the provided files as you want and add new options or fall-backs (e.g. an option to use Pygments). Read the documentation of the [`Redcarpet::CLI`](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/tree/v3.3.0/lib/redcarpet/cli.rb) class for further information.

### Undeprecate the RedCloth API compatibility layer

This release actually un-deprecates the RedCloth API compatibility layer. Since Redcarpet provides a different API than most processors, it turned out that this layer is used in libraries that provide support for different Markdown parsers.

### Bug fixes

As usual, some bugs have been fixed:
- Avoid parsing images when the given URL isn't safe and the `:safe_links_only` option is enabled.
- Add the `lang-` prefix in front of the language's name when using `:prettify` along with `:fenced_code_blocks`.

### New features

#### Updates to the `StripDown` render

The `StripDown` render object will now handle images and correctly display links' URL. For instance:

``` markdown
Here's a ![squirrel](shipit.png) !

And an external [link](https://github.com).
```

Will now render to:

```
Here's a squirrel shipit.png !

And an external link (https://github.com) !
```

#### Introducing the `Safe` render

In order to safely deal with users' input for instance, Redcarpet now ships with a `Redcarpet::Render::Safe` object.

The `:safe_links_only` and `:escape_html` options are turned on by default. It also has a custom `block_code` callback since by default the specified language will be set as the class of the rendered code block.

``` ruby
Redcarpet::Markdown.new(Redcarpet::Render::Safe)
```

#### HTML5 block-level elements recognition

HTML5 blocks-level elements are now recognized so that they will not be included under a paragraph.

### Deprecation

The Redcarpet's compatibility layer for the old RedCloth API has been deprecated. If you are still relying on it, please do update your code to rely on the new API.

This layer will be removed any time Redcarpet reaches 4.0.

### Bug fixes

Some bug fixes have also been applied:
- In-page links (with anchors) are now parsed when the `:safe_links_only` option is enabled ([#372](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/pull/372))
- Trailing single quotes are now correctly converted to curly quotes using Smarty Pants ([#340](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/340))
- The equal sign (=) can now be escaped (e.g. when using the `:highlight` option) ([#369](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/369))

It's been a long time since since we've released any version of Redcarpet but we are happy to announce the release of the version 3.1.0. Over [100 commits](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/compare/v3.0.0...v3.1.0) have been added since 3.0.0 with some new exciting features.

## New features

### Footnotes

This has been requested for a while but this is finally here. Redcarpet now ships with a `:footnotes` option for the `Markdown` object to allow you to use PHP-Markdown footnotes:

``` markdown
Markdown[^1] rocks!

[^1] : http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
```

You can override the output through the `#footnote_def`, `#footnote_ref` and `#footnotes` callbacks. Thanks to [the contributors](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/pull/271) of this feature!

### GitHub style anchors

Previously, passing the `:with_toc_data` option to a render object would generate ids according to the order of apparition of the headers (e.g. `toc_0`). The anchors are now humanized to improve the output so your table of contents are cleaner and more ""SEO-friendly"".

Also, by default, any markup is stripped out from the id:

``` markdown
# This is really **cool**
```

will generate:

``` html
<h1 id=""this-is-really-cool"">This is really <strong>cool</strong></h1>
```

### The `:quote` option

A `:quote` option has been added for the `Markdown` object and allows you to render quotation marks to `<q>` tags. You can override this output through the `#quote` callback.

## Bug fixes

Apart from the new features, a few bugs have been fixed:
- Fix code blocks' classes when using Google code prettify [#314](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/pull/314)
- Follow the standard to detect when new paragraph is outside last item [#111](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/111)
- Make ordered lists preceded by paragraph parsed with `:lax_spacing` [#311](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/311)
- Allow using tabs between a reference's colon and its link [#337](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/337)

# Backwards Compatibility

We've removed support for Ruby 1.8.x in this release. If you still need Ruby 1.8.x support, then you'll need to stick with Redcarpet 2.3.0.

We've also removed the sundown submodule that was included in the Redcarpet codebase. Sundown has been deprecated for some time and all the code has been included in the redcarpet repository for awhile as well. So long Sundown and thanks for all the fish.

# New features

## Highlight support

We've got a new option you can pass to the `Redcarpet::Markdown` object: `:highlight`. This feature will let you use wrap a bit of text in a pair of equals signs and Redcarpet will generate markup that will cause it to be highlighted. If you want to use this option, you can use the following Ruby code:

``` ruby
markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(Redcarpet::Render::HTML, :highlight => true)
```

to render the following markdown

```
This is ==highlighted== text, yo.
```

as

``` html
This is <mark>highlighted</mark> text, yo.
```

Thanks to Sam Soffes for contributing this. If you want to see it in action before you give it a try, check out [Sam's blog](http://sam.roon.io).

# Bug fixes

We've fixed several issues in the Redcarpet codebase in this release. Here are some of the highlights:
- Fixed an issue where mixing code spans and emphasis mangled the output ([#135](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/135) and [#190](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/190))
- Fixed an issue where nested parenthesis in a link didn't render correctly ([#237](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/237))
- Fixed an issue where FTP URIs were misidentified as email links when using autolinking ([#170](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/170))
- Fixed an issue where emphasis inside parenthesis was not parsed correctly ([#256](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/256))
- Fixed an issue where HTML comments were being needlessly escaped ([#268](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/268))

Thanks to Robin Dupret for fixing all of these!

### Wrapping this up

We're really excited about Redcarpet 3.0.0 and hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed making it. If you have any issues, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/new) and we'll take a look at it.
