### `-loader` is no longer automatically added when resolving loaders

This was removed because it often lead to problems.

You can still opt-in to the old behavior with the `resolveLoader.moduleExtensions` configuration option.

### Node.js 0.10 is no longer supported

Node.js LTS for this version is expired. You won't miss it.

Note: 0.12 will expire in December 2017. We will remove it soon too.

# Features:
- AMD `require` now supports an error callback as 3rd argument

# Bugfixes:
- Declarations from destruction now hides imports
- The parser now detects identifiers in destruction and default arguments
- The parser no longer crashes on empty patterns `[, a]`
- The schema now validates more stuff correctly
- `--version` now works correctly

### removed `postLoaders` and `preLoaders`

`rules` `enforce: ""left""` and `enforce: ""right""` can be used instead.

### `rules` should be used instead of `loaders`, but the old one still work.

Same syntax + additional options. Allows to configure the parser too. Allows matching by issuer.

### configuration is validated against a schema

### moved parser instancation into NormalModuleFactory

compiler.parser must no longer be used. Use this instead:

``` js
compiler.plugin(""compilation"", function(compilation, params) {
  params.normalModuleFactory.plugin(""parser"", function(parser, parserOptions) {
    parser.plugin(/* ... */);
  });
});
```

# Features:
- `DllReferencePlugin`
  - added `extensions` option.
  - `manifest` can be a path to a manifest, which is resolve at compile time.
- Rules
  - `parser` can be configured. Disable parsing features is now possible.
  - loader `options` (`query`) can be any object now. (Before only stringify-able object were possible)
- Loaders
  - loader-runner: loaders can return a Promise.
- Compilation
  - WebWorker: fixed HMR template
  - `ChunkModuleIdRangePlugin`: added experimental plugin to assign module ids to a chunk. (related to Long Term Caching)
- UglifyJs: version updated.
- MultiCompiler: `dependencies` parameter added. Allows to specify dependencies with multiple configurations. They are compiled in this order.
- CLI
  - multiple `--config`s allowed.
  - added `--display-provided-exports` and `--display-used-exports`
  - `-v` prints version
- CI
  - `.editorconfig` is validated

# Fixed Bugs:
- Tree Shaking
- System parsing
