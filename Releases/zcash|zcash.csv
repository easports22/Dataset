It also adds a new RPC method ``z_shieldcoinbase`` as an experimental feature, for easily shielding coinbase UTXOs. We encourage mining pools and exchanges to test it out over the next few weeks, and give feedback, before we make it a fully-supported RPC method in an upcoming release.

Summary of the changes included in this release:

1. We added ``z_shieldcoinbase`` as an experimental feature. (#2615)
2. We changed the ``importprivkey`` RPC method to return the public address corresponding to the imported key. (#2616)
3. We fixed build issues encountered when using GCC 7. (#2545)
4. We added support for fetching the public network parameters from IPFS. (#2597)

This release includes privacy and performance improvements, as well as bug fixes.

Summary of the changes included in this release:

1. We improved the privacy of transactions created by our wallet that pay from shielded addresses to transparent addresses. The new version conceals more information about shielded note values in chained JoinSplit transactions. (#2440)
2. We improved reindexing and block download performance by switching to `libsecp256k1` for transparent signature validation. (#2335, [stats](https://speed.z.cash/comparison/?exe=1%2B305%2C1%2B320&ben=15%2C14%2C11&env=1&hor=true&bas=1%2B305&chart=normal+bars))
3. We added a config parameter to reject transactions from the mempool by number of transparent inputs. This is a short-term workaround to handle periods of high network load, and will be replaced in the future by a more comprehensive mechanism. (#2342)
4. We merged several build system portability fixes. (#2412, #2420, #2436)
