**For future security related communications of our OSS projects, please [join this mailing list](http://eepurl.com/cQVY_5)**

We were notified of a directory traversal issue under the `/_next` and `/static` request namespace.
An attacker can craft a request that accesses potentially sensitive information in your filesystem.

tl;DR: the fix is live as a patch release and we're working together with a security firm to audit our OSS codebases routinely and avoid issues in the future.

## How to upgrade

- We have released patch versions of the stable and `beta` releases.
- The following versions fix this bug and include precautions to avoid
  similar problems in the future
  - `next@2.4.1`
  - `next@3.0.0-beta7`
- Run `npm install next@2.4.1 --save`

## Who is affected

- **Affected**: Users of Next.js prior to this release  
- **Not affected**: Deployments on https://now.sh (like https://zeit.co) are mitigated
- **Not affected**: Static deployments via `next export`

We recommend *everyone to upgrade regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not*.

Container-based deployments, `chroot` environments and virtualization users are at significantly less risk of sensitive data exposure. In most scenarios, an attacker would only be able to access frontend JavaScript components exclusively.

### How to assess impact

If you think sensitive code or data could have been exposed, please filter logs of affected sites by `..` (excluding quotes in all cases) and check for 200 responses.

## What is being done

As Next.js has grown in popularity, it has received the attention of security researchers and auditors. We are thankful to [@ru_raz0r](https://twitter.com/ru_raz0r) for his investigation and discovery of the original bug and subsequent responsible disclosure.

- We have notified large deployments of Next.js in advance of this publication.
- If you want to stay on top of our security related news impacting Next.js or other projects, please [join this mailing list](http://eepurl.com/cQVY_5).
- We are also very happy to announce that we're working together with [Lift Security](https://liftsecurity.io) / [Node Security](https://nodesecurity.io) on an audit of all our OSS projects in a recurring basis to ensure a safe experience for everyone.
- We encourage responsible disclosure of future issues. Please email us at **security@zeit.co**.

## New

### Accessing parsed url in getInitialProps

`getInitialProps` receives `pathname` and `query` in the argument now (#62).

``` js
export default class extends React.Component {
  static getInitialProps ({ pathname, query }) {
    ...
  }
} 
```

You can use them on both server and client. No manual parsing needed!
