7444454,2017-08-18T15:32:36Z,2017-08-18T15:35:57Z,V6.4.3,This quick patch release fixes a couple missing semicolons in the scss that were not impacting `node-sass` but were preventing webpack scss builds from working properly in 6.4.2.,https://api.github.com/users/kball,44007,kball,https://api.github.com/repos/zurb/foundation-sites/releases/7444454/assets,https://api.github.com/repos/zurb/foundation-sites/releases/7444454,develop,https://api.github.com/repos/zurb/foundation-sites/tarball/v6.4.3,https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/releases/tag/v6.4.3,https://api.github.com/repos/zurb/foundation-sites/zipball/v6.4.3,v6.4.3,False,False

Big shoutout to our @hikouki as one of our newer contributors who jumped in with quite a few different bug fixes, docs updates, and improvements!

Migration Notes:
* Grid containers for the XY grid have been reworked based on issues and feed back. This is a big one, and a big improvement. Check out the docs for more: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/xy-grid.html
* There was a naming conflict between the `$block-grid-max` variable for xy and regular grids, meaning you could not have both in with different values. The xy-grid setting has been separated out to `$xy-block-grid-max`. If you have changed the value of `$block-grid-max` and are using the xy-grid, you should update `$xy-block-grid-max`.

6853414,2017-06-27T16:51:12Z,2017-06-27T17:58:07Z,v6.4.0 - KELT-9,"Foundation 6.4 has dropped and it is HOT.  Code named KELT-9 after the hottest planet ever discovered, this new release is jampacked with some incredible new features that enable you to build layouts and designs with Foundation that weren’t possible before. Check out the details below:

# Major changes
1. Foundation 6.4 now uses Flexbox by default. There is still a fallback to float-mode for those who absolutely must support legacy browsers, but Flexbox is our recommended approach.
2. Foundation 6.4 has a BRAND NEW, super powerful default grid called the XY-grid.  This is a brand new 2-dimensional grid, inspired by css-grid but built on Flexbox to be usable in all-browser production environments today. Get started here: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/xy-grid.html.
Major props to @brettsmason for pushing this through. Thanks to  @corysimmons, @IamManchanda, @andycochran, and @oxyc who all went above and beyond to help make this turn out the way it did.
3. Foundation 6.4 has shifted the Foundation JavaScript architecture to a new ES2016 module-based architecture powered by webpack. If you are using webpack or another module bundler, you can now import Foundation modules as you would other modular javascript. If you are not using a module bundler, we have packaged up drop-in compiled JS files in dist/js for backwards compatibility. Thanks to @gakimball, @DaSchTour, and @TheLarkInn for helping make this a reality.

# Other New Stuff
1. Foundation 6 has always focused on supporting the entire lifecycle of a project from Prototype to Production, but the line between the two has sometimes been fuzzy. With Foundation 6.4, we're beginning to be much more explicit about parts of the framework that are intended for rapid prototyping but should not be part of your production project. As a part of that, 6.4 is shipping with a whole new slew of optional prototyping helpers and a ""prototype mode"" to speed up prototyping. Learn more here: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/prototyping-utilities.html.  Props to @IamManchanda for making this happen.
2. Magellan's ""smooth scroll"" behavior has been separated out into it's own plugin, which you can use to create ""smooth scroll"" behavior for any links inside a page: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/smooth-scroll.html. Props to @denisahac for this PR.

# Major Enhancements
1. Dropdowns and Tooltips now have super-powerful ""explicit positioning"" inspired by tether.js allowing you to position and align them exactly how you want. Implementation by @kball helped out by @IamManchanda and @SassNinja
2. Menu styling has been reworked to be simpler and more flexible. @brettsmason and @IamManchanda rocked this out in tandem.
3. Off Canvas now supports nesting and ""in-canvas"" panels that fit in your grid for some breakpoints and convert to off-canvas for smaller screens. Kudos to @SassNinja for this one.


# Bug Fixes
More than we can list

# Migration Notes
1. Menus now use `is-active` instead if `active` for active state. The old `active` works but is deprecated and will be removed.
2. Menus now use `align-center` on the menu rather than wrapping them in a `menu-centered` class to center them. The old way works but is deprecated and will be removed.
3. Tabs no longer trigger hide/show styles based off of an aria attribute, but rather the `is-active` class. Users of tabs who are customizing panelActiveClass will need to add `display:block;` to the styles for their panelActiveClass.
4. The `$card-margin` class has been changed to be `$card-margin-bottom` to better align with convention. If you have changed `$card-margin` update it to `$card-margin-bottom`.
5. The underlying file for the responsive accordion tabs plugin has changed. If you are upgrading an old ZURB stack project you will need to change the reference to `foundation-sites/js/foundation.zf.responsiveAccordionTabs.js` to reference `foundation-sites/js/foundation.responsiveAccordionTabs.js` instead.

*KELT-9*

*Astronomers have found the hottest known exoplanet, a world where temperatures exceed those on the surface of most stars.*

*The Jupiter-like planet, known as KELT-9b, zips around its hot host star once every 1.5 Earth days. Its orbit is so tight that the gas giant is tidally locked, always showing the same face to the star, just as the moon shows only one face to Earth.*

*Temperatures on KELT-9b's ""day side"" reach a blazing 7,800 degrees Fahrenheit (4,300 Celsius), the planet's discoverers said. That's hotter than the surface of the dwarf stars that dominate the Milky Way galaxy, and just 2,200 degrees F (1,200 degrees C) cooler than the surface of the sun. (However, temperatures in the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, can reach about 3 million degrees F, or 1.67 million degrees C.)*

## Updates from RC2:
1. Update XY grid margin & padding to be independently controllable along each axis. Instead of `.margin-gutters` and `.padding-gutters` you now will use `.grid-margin-x`, `.grid-margin-y`, `.grid-padding-x`, and `.grid-padding-y`. Props to @andycochran, @oxyc and @corysimmons for the feedback helping advance this idea and @brettsmason for the implementation.  Check out the new approach in the docs: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/6.4.0-rc/docs/xy-grid.html
2. Fix some issues in the `auto` behavior in the XY Grid.
3. Improved Javascript entry points... you can now simply `import Foundation from 'foundation-sites';` to get all of Foundation (autoinitialized), or batch import sets of plugins from `foundation-sites/js/entries/foundation-plugins`. How to make these imports super smooth is an ongoing area of conversation, join the convo in the modular js/webpack feedback thread!

_TRAPPIST-1B_

_TRAPPIST-1 is a planetary system, located 12 parsecs away from the Solar system (39 light years), near the ecliptic, within the constellation of Aquarius. Around a star which is 12 times less massive than the Sun and only slightly larger than Jupiter, there are at least seven planets in orbit. The initial discovery was made by TRAPPIST, the TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope. Additional planets were subsequently identified using TRAPPIST and the Spitzer space telescope, the Very Large Telescope, UKIRT, the Liverpool Telescope and the William Herschel Telescope._

Foundation is now EVEN MORE accessible out of the box, with a default color palette that meets AA contrast requirements, better keyboard navigation, and a slew of other improvements.

### Migration Notes:
- If you're using the ZURB template, check out this pull request to see the changes you'll want to make to update: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template/pull/49/files
- Flex Videos are now Responsive Embeds.  Old classes and mixin names are now deprecated.  Check out https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/pull/8765
- Accordion Items now MUST be labeled with `data-accordion-item`, they are no longer inferred from `li` elements.  Check out https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/pull/9178
- The dist directory structure has changed. CSS files now live in `dist/css`, JS files in `dist/js`.  Check out https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/pull/9078
- The default color palette has changed to be meet AA contrast requirements. This has changed both defaults and a number scss variables and functions.  Check out https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/pull/9319#issuecomment-263414697
- In order to facilitate vertical rhythm layouts, the old `$header-sizes` map has been replaced with a more general `$header-styles` map. `$header-styles` map not only allows to set the `font-size`, but also `line-height`, `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` per header size and breakpoint. `$header-sizes` still works, however, it is going to be depreciated. If `$header-sizes` is present in your `_settings.scss` it overrides any `$header-styles` map. Check out [#9419](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/pull/9419)
- Some older flex based mixins (flex-grid-order, flex-grid-row-align, flex-grid-column-align) and classes (.align-column/.align-row), that had been deprecated are now removed, along with a few old variables that are no longer relevant.  Check out [#9437](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/pull/9437)

2698942,2016-02-26T19:36:13Z,2016-02-26T19:44:12Z,Version 6.2 — Tethys,"Lots of awesome changes in this release, from ES2015 to flexbox.

**Be sure to read our [upgrade guide](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/wiki/Upgrading-to-Foundation-6.2) before making the leap.**

## General
- **ECMAScript 2015!** We updated our entire JavaScript codebase to ES2015, which is transpiled to ES5 using Babel. **The entire codebase is backwards-compatible.** No changes to your existing code are required.
  - Users of the ZURB Template will need to add Babel to their build process&mdash;see our [6.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/wiki/Upgrading-to-Foundation-6.2) for more info.
  - The `dist/` folder of the packages will continue to have ES5 code.
  - _Huge, huge_ props to @colin-marshall, who converted almost all of the core plugins to ES2015 classes for us.
- **Flexbox mode!** We introduced a flexbox grid in Foundation 6. With version 6.2, we're introducing a global flexbox mode, which turbocharges existing Foundation components with flexbox properties when enabled. To enable it, set the `$global-flexbox` variable in your settings file to `true`.
  - The flex grid classes for alignment and source ordering are now generic _flexbox utilities_, usable by any flexbox component. To get these classes, add `@include foundation-flex-classes` to your main Sass file.
  - We've got a [new flexbox page](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/blob/develop/docs/pages/flexbox.md) in the documentation that goes into more detail.
- **Customizable color palettes!** A new Sass variable called `$foundation-palette` now holds the hex codes for the primary, secondary, success, warning, and alert colors. The colors in this variable are used to create color classes for buttons, labels, and so on. This means you can add new colors to the list, and get new CSS classes to customize components.
  - The old variables, `$primary-color` and so on, still work, but now reference the values from this map.
  - Projects without `$foundation-palette` will continue to work like normal.
- **Native elements!** We added optional CSS styles for `<input type=""range"">`, `<progress>`, and `<meter>`. Because these elements are not supported by older browsers, they aren't enabled by default.
  - Enable range inputs with `@include foundation-range-input`.
  - Enable progress bars with `@include foundation-progress-element`.
  - Enable meters with `@include foundation-meter-element`.
- **ZURB Template updates!**
  - We updated the ZURB Template to Gulp 4.0 and an ES2015 Gulpfile. Upgrading to Gulp 4.0 allows us to more elegantly solve problems with task concurrency that we encountered with Gulp 3.
  - The template also now includes a configuration file, `config.yml`, which allows you to configure the build process without modifying the Gulpfile.
  - Lastly, we added Babel to the build process.
  - **Note that the updates to the template will not be in master until 6.2 is properly released.**
- Forms were placed before buttons in the default cascade, which fixes specificity issues between forms and buttons.
  - You don't have to upgrade this, but if you want to, just place `@import foundation-forms` before `@import foundation-buttons` in your main Sass file.
- The `.menu-icon` classes, previously bundled with Title Bar, now has their own file and CSS export. To use it, add `@include foundation-menu-icon` to your main Sass file.
- The `foundation-sites` npm package now works as an [Eyeglass](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass) module.
- Updated jQuery dependency to version 2.2.x.
- Added two new files to the `dist/` folder of our package: `foundation-rtl.css` and `foundation-rtl.min.css`, which are default builds of Foundation with right-to-left support enabled.
- Added a JSPM configuration to our npm package&mdash;thanks @glen-84!
- In the `app.scss` files we distribute with our templates, we now place the CSS for utility functions at the bottom of the file, below every component. This ensures that the styles for those classes actually apply.

## Sass Settings Changes

The following changes were made to `_settings.scss`. All new projects will get these changes automatically. **If you're upgrading an existing project, you'll need to change these defaults or add the new variables yourself.**
- **Added:** `$global-flexbox: false` &mdash; enables flexbox mode for components.
- **Added:** `$print-transparent-backgrounds: true` &mdash; sets if background colors of elements should be transparent when printing.
- **Added:** `$input-placeholder-color: $medium-gray` &mdash; sets text color of text input placeholders.
- **Added:** `$topbar-submenu-background: $topbar-background` &mdash; allows you to set a different menu color from the top bar background color. #8091
- **Added:** `$topbar-unstack-breakpoint: small` &mdash; allows you to set the breakpoint at which a top bar shifts from mobile to desktop mode.
- **Added:** `$menu-item-color-active` &mdash; color of menu items with an `.active` class.
- **Added:** `$menu-item-background-active: $primary-color` &mdash; background color of menu items with an `.active` class.
- **Removed:** `$tab-border` &mdash; use `$tab-content-border` instead.
- **Removed:** `$tooltip-pip-offset` &mdash; wasn't being used.
- **Removed:** `$menu-expand-max` &mdash; not needed any more with how menu CSS works now.
- **Updated:** `$grid-column-gutter` should now use the value `$grid-column-responsive-gutter` had in Foundation 6.1.

If you're interested in using the `<meter>` element, it has these settings variables:
- `$meter-height: $progress-height`
- `$meter-radius: $progress-radius`
- `$meter-background: $progress-background`
- `$meter-fill-good: $success-color`
- `$meter-fill-medium: $warning-color`
- `$meter-fill-bad: $alert-color`

The `<input type=""range"">` and `<progress>` components use the same variables as Slider and Progress Bar, respectively.

## Deprecations
- `flex-order()` is replacing `flex-grid-order()`.
- `flex-align()` is replacing `flex-grid-row-align()`.
- `flex-align-self()` is replacing `flex-grid-column-align()`.
- The use of alignment classes such as `.align-top`, `.align-middle`, and so on is being replaced by generic flexbox utility classes called `.align-self-top`, `.align-self-middle`, etc.
- Responsive gutter logic is now defined with `$grid-column-gutter` instead of `$grid-column-responsive-gutter`.

The old flex grid alignment/ordering mixins are still in the codebase, but using them will print a deprecation warning. They'll be removed entirely in Foundation 6.3.

In addition, the responsive gutter logic has completely replaced the old gutter logic. If you're not interested in using responsive gutters, you can still pass a numeric value to `$grid-column-gutter`, and it will be used on all screen sizes.

## Features
- Added flexbox helper mixins:
  - `flex()`: sets an element to `display: flex;`.
  - `flex-order()`: sets source order for a flex child.
  - `flex-align()`: sets horizontal or vertical alignment for a flex parent.
  - `flex-align-self()`: sets vertical alignment for a flex child.
- Button Group: added a `.stacked-for-medium` class.
- Flex Grid: added block grid support.
- Mixins
  - `form-input-error()`: added a `$background-alpha` parameter, which adjusts the opacity of the background color.
  - `foundation-everything()`: setting the `$flex` parameter to `true` will now also enable flexbox mode.
  - Added `map-deep-get()` to access deeply-nested properties in Sass maps.
  - Added `grid-layout-center-last()` to auto-center the last row of items in a block grid.
- Menu
  - Added an `.active` class, which can be applied to an `<li>` to visually represent the active item.
- Toggler
  - `data-toggle` can now trigger multiple elements at once. Just separate the IDs with spaces.
  - Added `data-toggle-focus`, which toggles elements on/off when an element is focused and unfocused.

## Bug fixes
- Breakpoints: removed the warning statements around using `xxlarge only` and `xxlarge down` in the `breakpoint()` mixin, in favor of better fallbacks:
  - If you use `only` with the highest breakpoint, the resulting media query will be `(min-width: n)`, where `n` is the width of the breakpoint.
  - If you use `down` with the highest breakpoint, no media query will be output. This is because `xxlarge down` means ""the xxlarge breakpoint and down"", which is equivalent to ""everything"".
- Button Group
  - Reworked to not use borders, which fixes several visual bugs with button groups. Thanks @andycochran! #7933
  - Fixed misaligned arrow inside a split button.
- Dropdown Menu: don't output unnecessary `a::after` CSS if `$dropdownmenu-arrows` is `false`.
- Forms: fixed some styles not being applied to `<input type=""radio"">`.
- Magellan: fixed it not working properly in Firefox.
- Menu: fixed `<span>` elements inside an `<a>` being misaligned.
- Mixins
  - `clearfix()`: added extra properties that allow it to work with flexbox elements. #8152
- Off-canvas: prevent margin collapsing on `.off-canvas-content`, which could create visual bugs with short pages.
- Pagination: use hex codes instead of special characters in the CSS `content` property.
- Reveal: the plugin's positioning logic was reworked to fix _many_ issues with modals, including:
  - Modals having an extreme top offset #8041
  - Not positioning correctly on small screens #7977
  - Not being able to scroll on Mobile Safari or Chrome for Android #7971
- Slider: fixed dual-handled sliders sometimes not rendering the fill properly on init. #8128
- Sticky: fixed incorrect height calculations due to DOM contents shifting around before the page is fully loaded.
- Typography: fixed `$keystroke-radius` variable not being applied to `<kbd>` elements.

## Changes Since 6.2.0 RC1

These are changes made from version 6.2.0-rc.1 to 6.2.0.

### General
- Pushed the deprecation of legacy media query variables (`$small-up` and so on) back to version 6.3.
- We migrated from JSHint to ESLint&mdash;thanks @colin-marshall!

### Features
- Drilldown Menu: added a `parentLink` option. When set to `true`, on every drilldown submenu, the link of the parent item is added to the top of the menu as a separate link.

### Bug Fixes
- Dropdown: fixed panes not aligning properly in RTL.
- Dropdown Menu: fixed arrows and submenus being positioned incorrectly if the `.vertical` class is used in conjunction with a class like `.medium-horizontal` or `.large-horizontal`.
- Forms: fixed `<select>` arrows not appearing in IE10/11.
- Grid: fixed numeric values for the `$gutter` parameter of the `grid-column()` and `flex-grid-column()` mixins not working.
- Menu
  - Fixed the CSS related to icons interfering with base styles of the menu.
  - Added a clearfix to menus with `.align-right`.
- Progress: fixed `<progress>` elements in Internet Explorer not being filled in.
- Reveal: fixed modals not closing the first time a close trigger was clicked.
- Table: the recommended HTML for scrolling tables has been updated&mdash;to get them working across all browsers, you should now wrap the `<table>` in a container with the class `.table-scroll`, and you don't need the `.scroll` class on the table.
  - If you don't need IE9 support, you can keep doing it the old way.

_Tethys is one of Saturn's larger moons, and also one of the least dense major moons in our Solar System. It's named for the Greek aquatic goddess of the same name._

- **Removed:** `$menu-expand-max` &mdash; not needed any more with how menu CSS works now.
- **Updated:** `$grid-column-gutter` should now use the value `$grid-column-responsive-gutter` had in Foundation 6.1.

If you're interested in using the `<meter>` element, it has these settings variables:
- `$meter-height: $progress-height`
- `$meter-radius: $progress-radius`
- `$meter-background: $progress-background`
- `$meter-fill-good: $success-color`
- `$meter-fill-medium: $warning-color`
- `$meter-fill-bad: $alert-color`

The `<input type=""range"">` and `<progress>` components use the same variables as Slider and Progress Bar, respectively.

## Deprecations
- `flex-order()` is replacing `flex-grid-order()`.
- `flex-align()` is replacing `flex-grid-row-align()`.
- `flex-align-self()` is replacing `flex-grid-column-align()`.
- The use of alignment classes such as `.align-top`, `.align-middle`, and so on is being replaced by generic flexbox utility classes called `.align-self-top`, `.align-self-middle`, etc.
- Responsive gutter logic is now defined with `$grid-column-gutter` instead of `$grid-column-responsive-gutter`.

The old flex grid alignment/ordering mixins are still in the codebase, but using them will print a deprecation warning. They'll be removed entirely in Foundation 6.3.

In addition, the responsive gutter logic has completely replaced the old gutter logic. If you're not interested in using responsive gutters, you can still pass a numeric value to `$grid-column-gutter`, and it will be used on all screen sizes.

## Features
- Added flexbox helper mixins:
  - `flex()`: sets an element to `display: flex;`.
  - `flex-order()`: sets source order for a flex child.
  - `flex-align()`: sets horizontal or vertical alignment for a flex parent.
  - `flex-align-self()`: sets vertical alignment for a flex child.
- Button Group: added a `.stacked-for-medium` class.
- Flex Grid: added block grid support.
- Mixins
  - `form-input-error()`: added a `$background-alpha` parameter, which adjusts the opacity of the background color.
  - `foundation-everything()`: setting the `$flex` parameter to `true` will now also enable flexbox mode.
  - Added `map-deep-get()` to access deeply-nested properties in Sass maps.
  - Added `grid-layout-center-last()` to auto-center the last row of items in a block grid.
- Menu
  - Added an `.active` class, which can be applied to an `<li>` to visually represent the active item.
- Toggler
  - `data-toggle` can now trigger multiple elements at once. Just separate the IDs with spaces.
  - Added `data-toggle-focus`, which toggles elements on/off when an element is focused and unfocused.

## Bug fixes
- Breakpoints: removed the warning statements around using `xxlarge only` and `xxlarge down` in the `breakpoint()` mixin, in favor of better fallbacks:
  - If you use `only` with the highest breakpoint, the resulting media query will be `(min-width: n)`, where `n` is the width of the breakpoint.
  - If you use `down` with the highest breakpoint, no media query will be output. This is because `xxlarge down` means ""the xxlarge breakpoint and down"", which is equivalent to ""everything"".
- Button Group
  - Reworked to not use borders, which fixes several visual bugs with button groups. Thanks @andycochran! #7933
  - Fixed misaligned arrow inside a split button.
- Dropdown Menu: don't output unnecessary `a::after` CSS if `$dropdownmenu-arrows` is `false`.
- Forms: fixed some styles not being applied to `<input type=""radio"">`.
- Magellan: fixed it not working properly in Firefox.
- Menu: fixed `<span>` elements inside an `<a>` being misaligned.
- Mixins
  - `clearfix()`: added extra properties that allow it to work with flexbox elements. #8152
- Off-canvas: prevent margin collapsing on `.off-canvas-content`, which could create visual bugs with short pages.
- Pagination: use hex codes instead of special characters in the CSS `content` property.
- Reveal: the plugin's positioning logic was reworked to fix _many_ issues with modals, including:
  - Modals having an extreme top offset #8041
  - Not positioning correctly on small screens #7977
  - Not being able to scroll on Mobile Safari or Chrome for Android #7971
- Slider: fixed dual-handled sliders sometimes not rendering the fill properly on init. #8128
- Sticky: fixed incorrect height calculations due to DOM contents shifting around before the page is fully loaded.
- Typography: fixed `$keystroke-radius` variable not being applied to `<kbd>` elements.

2478386,2016-01-23T00:59:31Z,2016-01-23T01:11:46Z,Version 6.1.2 — Planet Nine,"## Sass Settings Changes

The following changes were made to `_settings.scss`. All new projects will get these changes automatically. **If you're upgrading an existing project, you'll need to change these defaults or add the new variables yourself.**
- **Added** `$topbar-title-spacing: 1rem`
- **Removed** `$topbar-link-color`

## General
- Our Sass unit tests have been migrated from Bootcamp to True—thanks @colin-marshall!
- The jQuery dependency in `package.json` has been locked to 2.1.x, like `bower.json`. Before, npm would allow for bumping minor versions while Bower would not. For Foundation 6.2, we'll bump our jQuery dependency to 2.2.

## Features
- `table()` mixin: added a `$nest` parameter. When set to `true`, selectors for `tbody`, `td`, etc. are nested inside the current selector. This allows you to constrain the Foundation table styles to a custom class. #7454
- Flex Grid: added styles for `.column.row`.
- Added a new variation on the syntax for top bar, which allows for a separate title area and menu area. Works great with the Responsive Toggler plugin! Learn more in the [Advanced section](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/top-bar.html#advanced) of the top bar documentation. Thanks @brettsmason for the idea and the CSS!

  - Prevent text inside of a `<legend>` from overflowing in IE10.
  - Use `$button-radius` instead of `$global-radius` to determine the border radius of `<input type=""submit"">` and `<input type=""button"">` elements.
- Dropdown
  - Properly apply the `$dropdown-font-size` variable in the dropdown CSS. #7919
  - Prevent submenus from anchoring on the wrong side when the top-level menu is vertical.

  - Cut back the specificity of the various state classes, such as `.is-dropdown-submenu` and `.is-dropdown-submenu-parent`.
- Reveal
  - Fix the `$reveal-offset` variable not being used in the modal CSS. #7780
  - Prevent a callout with `data-closable` inside of a modal from closing the modal.
  - Prevent modal from resizing right before it disappears, when animating out.
  - Fix modals not closing if set to be full-screen, or set to not have an overlay.
- Breakpoints
  - `breakpoint()` mixin: will emit warnings if used improperly, such as creating an `xxlarge only` media query, when `xxlarge` is the highest breakpoint.
  - Updated the code to avoid a deprecation warning in Ruby Sass 3.4.20.
- Drilldown
  - Fix the wrong state class being added to drilldown submenus. #7885

  - Added proper right-to-left support.
  - Fix left and right handles overflowing the container.
- Top Bar
  - Prevent buttons that are `<a>`s inside of top bar from getting link `color` styles.
  - Properly apply the background color of the top bar to `<ul>`s nested inside of it.
- Accordion: Remove double border at the bottom of the accordion container, and prevent the border on the last accordion title from disappearing when it's the active one.
- Accordion Menu: Fix `aria-expanded` in submenus not being updated.
- Button: Prevent the `.expanded` and `.stacked-for-small` classes from fighting with each other.
- Media Object: Remove an invalid selector and replace it with a more valid one.
- Menu: Fix styles in the `.simple` class from being overridden by more specific base menu CSS.
- Menu Icon: In 6.1, we quietly removed the `.dark` class for `.menu-icon`, which hadn't been documented. By popular demand, we added it back!
- Off-canvas: Fix `closeOnClick` not working when set to `false` and there are two menus on the page.
- Orbit: No longer attempts to auto-play if there's only one slide.
- Pagination: Correct the behavior of `$pagination-mobile-items` to prevent all of the page numbers from disappearing on mobile.
- Progress Bar: Changed the selector for `.progress-meter-text` to be standalone instead of nested, reducing its specificity.

- Table: Add `width: 100%` to tables so they expand automatically.
- Toggler: Added a better fallback when using without Motion UI.
- Tooltip: Fix `templateClasses` option not working.

_We would have saved this release codename for Foundation 9, but by then it may have been found that the planet doesn't exist._

- Removed a rogue root-level `&` in Sass that caused errors in Ruby Sass.
- Prevent the `open` trigger of off-canvas from firing multiple times.
- Fixed two issues with off-canvas panes that use the `.reveal-for-*` classes:
  - If an off-canvas is revealed, a click trigger won't open it.
  - If an off-canvas is open on a small screen and the browser is scaled up, it will ""close"" properly.
- Fixed an issue with Sticky where calling `data-sticky` with no anchor points would cause it to remain sticky only for the height of the view, not the height of the document.
- Fix Abide not firing the `formvalid` and `forminvalid` elements from form elements.
- Added an option for off-canvas to trap focus, `trapFocus`. The default value is `false`.
- Fixed the Interchange `replaced` event not firing for replaced background images.

_Charon is a moon of Pluto that manages to have a diameter nearly half the size of its host planet._

2330875,2015-12-23T01:19:19Z,2015-12-23T01:22:45Z,Version 6.1 — Hyperion,"### Upgrades Required

#### Base Font Size

In Foundation 6.0 (and 5.0 before it), the base font size was changed with `$global-font-size`, and the number used in `rem-calc()` was changed with `$rem-calc`. This made adjusting the font size fairly confusing, and had the side effect of the base font size affecting the ""real"" pixel widths of the grid and breakpoints.

In Foundation 6.1, we rolled the functionality of `$rem-calc` into `$global-font-size`. `$global-font-size` is now used in the math behind `rem-calc()`. This insures that, for example, increasing the base font size won't make your grid wider. Breakpoints will also now always be the same, regardless of your design's base font size.

**To upgrade, remove `$rem-base` from your project and just use `$global-font-size`.** The value of `$global-font-size` can be a percent value, or a pixel value.

#### Responsive Gutters

The way grid gutters function has changed. Before, one variable controlled the global grid gutter width.

``` scss
$grid-column-gutter: 30px;
```

Now, the gutters are responsive, meaning they change widths at different screen sizes. These are the default values:

``` scss
$grid-column-responsive-gutter: (
  small: 20px,
  medium: 30px,
);
```

You can add additional gutters that correspond to other breakpoints, based on what's in your project's `$breakpoints` map.

The existing gutter functionality will keep working in 6.1, but **the old gutter functionality will be removed in Foundation 6.2, so here's how you can upgrade:**
- To keep the static gutters in an existing project, don't change anything, and they'll continue to work the same until Foundation 6.2.
- To activate responsive gutters in an existing project, set `$grid-column-gutter` to `null`, or remove the variable from your settings file entirely.
- Want to upgrade, but not into responsive gutters? Use this value:
  - `$grid-column-responsive-gutter: ( small: 20px, );`

### Sass Settings Changes

The following changes were made to _settings.scss. All new projects will get these changes automatically. **If you're upgrading an existing project, you'll need to change these defaults or add the new variables yourself.**
- **Added** `$dropdownmenu-arrow-color: $anchor-color`
- **Added** `$accordionmenu-arrow-color: $anchor-color`
- **Added** `$drilldown-arrow-color: $anchor-color`
- **Changed** `$select-background: $white`
- **Removed** `$rem-base`

### Features
- **Responsive gutters!** Grid gutters are now responsive. On small screens, the gutter is 24px. On the `large` breakpoint and up, the gutter is 30px.
- **Abide actually works!** Our awesome community stepped up and helped us overhaul Abide, fixing many, many issues that shipped in 6.0. Thanks to @briantan888, @designerno1, @semikolon, @viniciusban, and others.
- **Equalizer is way faster!** We significantly refactored Equalizer to improve performance when the window is resized and better handle nested uses of the plugin.
  - Along with this, a new plugin option was added, `equalizeOn`. Pass in the name of a breakpoint to have Equalizer kick in on that specific breakpoint or wider.
  - And one more thing! The option `equalizeByRow` allows you to equalize columns within a row, even as they wrap into separate lines.
- Added mixins for flex grid row and column alignment.
  - `flex-grid-row-align()`
  - `flex-grid-column-align()`
- Added mixins for tabs, so you can write your own class structure with our styles.
  - `tabs-container()`
  - `tabs-container-vertical()`
  - `tabs-title()`
  - `tabs-content()`
  - `tabs-content-vertical()`
  - `tabs-panel()`
- The `dist/` folder of the npm/Bower packages now include alternative compiled CSS file with the Flex Grid enabled, called `foundation-flex.css` and `foundation-flex.min.css`.
- Added the settings file back to the npm/Bower packages. We removed it at first because we didn't want developers trying to edit and import it directly. However, we added it back after some developers told us that it's useful to be able to copy the file out of the package. We also need it there to get our Rails gem working.
- Added a `$gutter` parameter to the `grid-row()` and `flex-grid-row()` mixins. In light of responsive gutters being added, when this parameter is `null`, the responsive gutter logic is used.
- Added features to the flex grid borrowed from the float grid: `.expanded` class, offsets, and responsive collapsing.
- The CSS for the flex grid was streamlined to use less `@media` blocks.
- As clever as [quantity queries](http://alistapart.com/article/quantity-queries-for-css) are, it turns out `display: table-cell` does the job just as well. The CSS for expanded buttons and button groups is now much slimmer. #7326
- Interchange will automatically initialize Foundation plugins inside of replaced HTML.
- Added a `.destroy()` method to off-canvas.

### Bug Fixes
- Many fixes for Abide:
  - Validation failing with `<input type=""number"">`
  - Form not submitting even when valid
  - The `Abide.validateForm()` method doesn't fire an event
  - Hidden inputs are validated
  - Empty `<textarea>` elements are always marked invalid
  - Custom patterns can't be passed
  - Required `email` and `password` fields always marked invalid
- `$dropdown-width` is now properly applied to dropdown panes. #7353
- Prevent dropdown menus being misaligned by one pixel because of the border. #7514
- Fix incorrect styling for hollow button groups. #7571
- Removed the `padding-top` property from flex video, which was cropping the video inside on the left and right.
- A number of components had `background` properties changed to `background-color`, to make style overrides easier.
- Fixed a specificity issue causing `-centered` and `-uncentered` to fight with each other.
- `$accordion-content-background` is now properly applied to accordion content panes.
- Use `overflow-x: auto` instead of `overflow-y: scroll` with scrolling tables to fix cross-browser issues.
- Use `$accordion-content-padding` instead of `$accordion-item-padding` to accordion content panes. It just makes sense.
- Fixed more issues with JavaScript plugins not initializing when the code was run through a mangler.

### Deprecations
- Removed `hasvalue()` in favor of `has-value()`, as announced in Foundation 6.0.4.
- Removed `v-align-center()` in favor of `vertical-center()`, as announced in Foundation 6.0.4.

_Hyperion was the seventh moon of Saturn to be discovered, and also the first non-spherical moon to be discovered.

- **We got a CDN going!** The folks at jsDelivr made us a dedicated URL and everything! Head over to [foundationcdn.com](https://www.foundationcdn.com/) and you can get CSS and JavaScript CDN links. It's also possible to get links for individual JavaScript plugins.
- **The way Normalize is exported has changed.** Before, Normalize.css was automatically printed when calling `@import 'foundation'`. Now, Normalize is bundled with the `foundation-global-styles()` mixin. If you're using one of our project templates (or your project's main Sass file is configured similarly), you won't need to change anything to upgrade.
- **Legacy support for Foundation 5 breakpoints has been added.** If you're upgrading a project that uses `$small-up`, `$medium-up` and so on, those variables are now in the Foundation 6 codebase. They reference the values in the `$breakpoints` variable, which is how breakpoints are set in Foundation 6. Eventually, you should convert your Sass codebase to use the `breakpoint()` mixin over these variables, **as they will be removed in version 6.2**.
- CSS downloads of Foundation now include a version number at the top of `foundation.css`, as a handy reference.

### Sass Settings Changes

The following changes were made to `_settings.scss`. All new projects will get these changes automatically. **If you're upgrading an existing project, you'll need to change these defaults or add the new variables yourself.**
- **Changed** `$button-margin` to `0 0 $global-margin 0` from `0 $global-margin $global-margin 0`.
- **Changed** `$topbar-background` to `$light-gray` from `#eee`.
- **Changed** `$topbar-link-color` to `$primary-color` from `#fff`.

**That last one is critical**, as a number of developers filed issues about links inside top bar being white.

### Style Changes
- Button: removed the right margin on buttons.
- Callout: we removed the link tinting feature which gave green callouts green links, red callouts red links, and so on. The foreground/background contrast is way too low, and the CSS conflicts with other components that use `<a>`, such as buttons.

### Bug Fixes

#### CSS
- Top Bar: give `<input type=""button"">` elements in a top bar an automatic width, instead of the 200px width prescribed by `.top-bar input`. #7389
- Top Bar: switched link color from white to `$primary-color`.
- Media Object: removed the Sass `&` that snuck its way into the CSS output.
- Grid: fixed a misalignment issue when a column row is nested inside of a row.
- Input Group: fix border radii not being applied properly, specifically in conjunction with the `$global-radius` variable.

#### JavaScript
- General: if a plugin fails to initialize, the JavaScript error is caught, allowing other plugins to be initialized. #7356
- Drilldown: fix back button not working when custom markup is used. #7360
- Toggler: prevent certain config data attributes being overwritten on initialization.
- Reveal: prevent double overlays from appearing.
- Reveal: fixed the modal appearing below the overlay in iOS. #7415
- Dropdown: prevent the page from scrolling when the space bar is pressed while a form field inside the dropdown is focused. #7416
- Accordion Menu: prevent animation bugs if the menu is toggled up and down really fast. #7418
- Slider: prevent issues when the `decimal` option is 0. #7461
- Accordion: can now be used with any element, not just `<ul>` and `<li>`. #7469
- Responsive Menu: prevent a flash of un-styled content before the JavaScript has initialized.

The following components saw HTML changes to fix bugs or improve accessibility.

**Labels and badges** should have unique IDs, and the elements they describe should have the attribute `aria-describedby`.

``` html
<h1 aria-describedby=""messageCount"">Unread Messages</h1>
<span class=""badge"" id=""messageCount"">1<span>
```

**No update is required**, but current uses of the label and badge are not fully accessible without these changes. Refer to the documentation for [label](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/label.html) and [badge](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/badge.html) to learn more.

**Buttons in input groups** require a wrapper. This fixes issues with `<button>` and `<input>` elements not working within input groups.

``` diff
<div class=""input-group"">
  <span class=""input-group-label"">$</span>
  <input class=""input-group-field"" type=""number"">
-  <input type=""submit"" class=""input-group-button button"" value=""Submit"">
+  <div class=""input-group-button"">
+    <input type=""submit"" class=""button"" value=""Submit"">
+  </div>
</div>
```

**An update is required if you want to use `<button>` or `<input>`.** If you're using `<a>`, the old structure will continue to work fine, but you should update anyway.

### Sass Settings Changes

The following changes were made to `_settings.scss`. All new projects will get these changes automatically. **If you're upgrading an existing project, you'll need to change these defaults or add the new variables yourself.**

**Changed** `$block-grid-max` from `6` to `8`.
**Changed** `$input-color` from `$dark-gray` to `$black`
**Added** `$grid-column-align-edge: true`
**Added** Sass variables for Title Bar:
- `$titlebar-background: $black`
- `$titlebar-color: $white`
- `$titlebar-padding: 0.5rem`
- `$titlebar-text-font-weight: bold`
- `$titlebar-icon-color: $white`
- `$titlebar-icon-color-hover: $medium-gray`
- `$titlebar-icon-spacing: 0.25rem`

### Package Changes
- The Bower package now references `dist/foundation.js` as the main JavaScript file.

### New Features
- Links within dropdown menus can be configured to function as normal when tapped twice in a row on a touch device. This means, on a touch device, the first tap opens the sub-menu, while the second tap follows the link. To enable this feature, set the `forceFollow` option to `true` in your JavaScript, or the attribute `data-force-follow=""true""` in a dropdown menu's HTML.
- Magellan can be configured with a custom offset to change where the ""top"" of the page is as the user scrolls. This is useful if your design has a sticky header, making the effective top of the page farther down. Change this setting with the `barOffset`/`data-bar-offset` option. The default value is `0`.

### Bug Fixes

2181539,2015-11-25T02:06:41Z,2015-11-25T02:07:46Z,Version 6.0.4 — Tarvis,"### Breaking Changes

Yes, there are a few. We're going to abuse semver a little bit at the beginning here while we massage the Sass API.
- **Renamed Sass function** `hasvalue()` to `has-value()`. The old function name will be removed in Foundation 6.1.
- **Removed Sass function** `v-align-center()` in favor of `vertical-center()`&mdash;see below. `v-align-center()` will be removed in Foundation 6.1.

### Sass Settings Changes

The following changes were made to `_settings.scss`. All new projects will get these changes automatically.
- **Removed** `$text-direction`, which was a duplicate of `$global-text-direction`.
- **Removed** `$global-namespace`, which is non-functioning.
- **Added** `$offcanvas-fixed-reveal: true`.
- **Added** `$dropdownmenu-border: 1px solid $medium-gray`.

### New Features
- Okay, it's not _new_ new, but support for `data-options` as a way to pass parameters to JavaScript plugins is back.
- If an off-canvas menu is revealed on a larger screen, you have the choice to make the menu fixed position or not. This is handled by a new Sass variable, `$offcanvas-fixed-reveal`. The feature is enabled by default.
- We added a few new mixins for vertically and horizontally centering items in CSS. They use the `position: absolute;` plus `transform: translate(-50%, -50%);` trick we all know and love.
  - `vertical-center()` will vertically align an element.
  - `horizontal-center()` will horizontally align an element.
  - `absolute-center()` will vertically _and_ horizontally align an element.
  - These functions replace the old `vertical-center()` and `v-align-center()` mixins, which did something similar, but were somewhat confusingly named.

Thanks to @HugoGiraudel for sharing his positioning mixins with us!

### Bug Fixes
- Added `!default` flags to components missing them.
- Dropdown menus were refactored to better handle click and hover states, and function much faster overall.
- Fixed pagination arrows not appearing on next/previous links.
- Fixed drilldown menus not working with RTL pages.
- Fixed z-index issues with revealed off-canvas menus, which prevented anything inside the menu from being clicked on.

We also pulled in many, many pull requests that refine our documentation. Thanks again to the community for fixing our typos for us :)

- Added `!default` flags to Sass variables missing them. This prevented some settings variables from being modified. These components were fixed:
  - Breadcrumbs
  - Base typography
  - Pagination
- Added a Sass variable, `$block-grid-max`, to change how many block grid CSS classes are created. This allows you to go higher than six-up with block grids.
- Fix dropdown menus not working with touch devices if `clickOpen=""false""`.
- Removed an unneeded JS file, `motion-ui.js`, which was the same as `foundation.util.motion.js`.
- Fixed the `.end` class not properly floating columns to the left.
- Fixed the last element in a block grid not properly floating to the left.
- Orbit adds the `.is-active` class to the first slide if it's not already there.
- Fixed an issue with hover dropdowns when clicked on.
- Fixed a Sass compile error when `$breakpoint-classes` contains every breakpoint in `$breakpoint`.
