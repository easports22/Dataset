# Version 1.0 of micro

Micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the full capabilities of modern terminals. It comes as one single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies, and you can download and use it right now.

As the name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use in a pinch, but micro also aims to be enjoyable to use full time, whether you work in the terminal because you prefer it (like me), or because you need to (over ssh).

# Features
- Easy to use and to install
- No dependencies or external files are needed -- just the binary you can download further down the page
- Common keybindings (ctrl-s, ctrl-c, ctrl-v, ctrl-z...)
  - Keybindings can be rebound to your liking
- Sane defaults
  - You shouldn't have to configure much out of the box (and it is extremely easy to configure)
- Splits and tabs
- Extremely good mouse support
  - This means mouse dragging to create a selection, double click to select by word, and triple click to select by line
- Cross platform (It should work on all the platforms Go runs on)
  - Note that while Windows is supported, there are still some bugs that need to be worked out
- Plugin system (plugins are written in Lua)
- Persistent undo
- Automatic linting and error notifications
- Syntax highlighting (for over [75 languages](runtime/syntax)!)
- Colorscheme support
  - By default, micro comes with 16, 256, and true color themes.
- True color support (set the `MICRO_TRUECOLOR` env variable to 1 to enable it)
- Copy and paste with the system clipboard
- Small and simple
- Easily configurable
- Common editor things such as undo/redo, line numbers, unicode support...

Although not yet implemented, I hope to add more features such as autocompletion, and multiple cursors in the future.
